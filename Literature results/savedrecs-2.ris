AB  - Work-related stress has long been recognized as an essential factor affecting employees' health and wellbeing. Repeated exposure to acute occupational stressors puts workers at high risk for depression, obesity, hypertension, and early death. Assessment of the effects of acute stress on workers' wellbeing usually relies on subjective self -reports, questionnaires, or measuring biometric and biochemical markers in long-cycle time intervals. This study aimed to develop and validate the use of a multiparameter wearable armband for continuous non-invasive monitoring of physiological states. Two worker populations were monitored 24 h/day: six loggers for one day and six ICU nurses working 12-hr shifts for one week. Stress responses in nurses were highly correlated with changes in heart rate variability (HRV) and pulse transit time (PTT). A rise in the low-to high-frequency (LF/LH) ratio in HRV was also coincident with stress responses. HRV on workdays decreased compared to non-work days, and PTT also exhibited a persistent decrease reflecting increased blood pressure. Compared to loggers, nurses were involved in high-intensity work activities 45% more often but were less active on non-work days. The wearable technology was well accepted by all worker participants and yielded high signal quality, critical factors for long-term non-invasive occupational health monitoring.

AB  - Background Behavior and health are inextricably linked. As a result, continuous wearable sensor data offer the potential to predict clinical measures. However, interruptions in the data collection occur, which create a need for strategic data imputation. Objective The objective of this work is to adapt a data generation algorithm to impute multivariate time series data. This will allow us to create digital behavior markers that can predict clinical health measures. Methods We created a bidirectional time series generative adversarial network to impute missing sensor readings. Values are imputed based on relationships between multiple fields and multiple points in time, for single time points or larger time gaps. From the complete data, digital behavior markers are extracted and are mapped to predicted clinical measures. Results We validate our approach using continuous smartwatch data for n = 14 participants. When reconstructing omitted data, we observe an average normalized mean absolute error of 0.0197. We then create machine learning models to predict clinical measures from the reconstructed, complete data with correlations ranging from r = 0.1230 to r = 0.7623. This work indicates that wearable sensor data collected in the wild can be used to offer insights on a person's health in natural settings.

AB  - Breast cancer is one of the most significant causes of death for women around the world. Breast thermography supported by deep convolutional neural networks is expected to contribute significantly to early detection and facilitate treatment at an early stage. The goal of this study is to investigate the behavior of different recent deep learning methods for identifying breast disorders. To evaluate our proposal, we built classifiers based on deep convolutional neural networks modelling inception V3, inception V4, and a modified version of the latter called inception MV4. MV4 was introduced to maintain the computational cost across all layers by making the resultant number of features and the number of pixel positions equal. DMR database was used for these deep learning models in classifying thermal images of healthy and sick patients. A set of epochs 3-30 were used in conjunction with learning rates 1 x 10(-3), 1 x 10(-4) and 1 x 10(-5), Minibatch 10 and different optimization methods. The training results showed that inception V4 and MV4 with color images, a learning rate of 1 x 10(-4), and SGDM optimization method, reached very high accuracy, verified through several experimental repetitions. With grayscale images, inception V3 outperforms V4 and MV4 by a considerable accuracy margin, for any optimization methods. In fact, the inception V3 (grayscale) performance is almost comparable to inception V4 and MV4 (color) performance but only after 20-30 epochs. inception MV4 achieved 7% faster classification response time compared to V4. The use of MV4 model is found to contribute to saving energy consumed and fluidity in arithmetic operations for the graphic processor. The results also indicate that increasing the number of layers may not necessarily be useful in improving the performance.

AB  - Real-time wearable electrocardiogram monitoring sensor is one of the best candidates in assisting cardiovascular disease diagnosis. In this paper, we present a novel real-time machine learning system for Arrhythmia classification. The system is based on the parallel Delta modulation and QRS/PT wave detection algorithms. We propose a patient dependent rotated linear-kernel support vector machine classifier that combines the global and local classifiers, with three types of feature vectors extracted directly from the Delta modulated bit-streams. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. According to the AAMI standard, two binary classifications are performed and evaluated, which are supraventricular ectopic beat (SVEB) versus the rest four classes, and ventricular ectopic beat (VEB) versus the rest. For SVEB classification, the preferred SkP-32 method's F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity value are 0.83, 79.3%, 99.6%, and 88.2%, respectively, and for VEB classification, the numbers are 0.92%, 92.8%, 99.4%, and 91.6%, respectively. The results show that the performance of our proposed approach is comparable to that of published research. The proposed low-complexity algorithm has the potential to be implemented as an on-sensor machine learning solution.

AB  - PURPOSE The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of implementing a postoperative monitoring program for women with gynecologic cancers composed of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and a wearable activity monitor. METHODS We prospectively enrolled patients undergoing gynecologic cancer surgery to this single-arm study. Enrolled patients completed PROs (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System physical function, sleep disturbance, anxiety, fatigue, and pain intensity) at baseline and one-week intervals for 4 weeks. They also wore a wearable accelerometer device that measured steps, heart rate, and intensity of physical activity. The primary outcome was feasibility. The secondary outcome was prediction of unscheduled contacts with the health care system on a given postoperative day. RESULTS We enrolled 34 women. Three patients were unevaluable. The mean age was 58 years. The mean body mass index was 31 kg/m(2); 17 patients were White (54.8%), 12 patients were Black (38.7%), and two patients (6.5%) were Asian. The overall wear time was 83.8%, and patients responded to 80.4% of the PRO instruments. Twenty-two patients (71%) had an unscheduled contact with the health care system postoperatively (median 1.5, 0.0-8.0). The day of an unscheduled health care utilization event was predicted with acceptable discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.81). PROs of fatigue and physical function were most predictive followed by wearable device outputs of lightly active minutes and average daily heart rate. CONCLUSION Implementation of a postoperative monitoring program of patient-reported outcomes and a wearable device was feasible. The specific day of an unscheduled contact with the health care system was predicted with acceptable discrimination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use wearable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine the effect of Buerger exercises on diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) healing.
   METHODS: Study authors enrolled 50 consecutive patients in a 1-year prospective observational study of DFUs. The patients were divided into groups by their arterial statuses: group A (no peripheral arterial disease [PAD]), group B (PAD without angioplasty), and group C (PAD with angioplasty). Tissue perfusion was assessed through wireless wearable NIRS to determine the effects of Buerger exercises on wound healing.
   MAIN RESULTS: The patients in group C were older, were more likely to have had an amputation, and had more severe wounds than did the patients in other groups. The requirements of insulin injection for diabetes mellitus control differed significantly (P=.024) among the three groups. At the end of the survey, 19 patients (38%) had unhealed DFUs. The NIRS revealed that most nonhealed patients in groups B and C shared higher resting hemoglobin levels and tissue blood volume and lower tissue oxygen concentration, which indicated inflammation accompanied by higher blood flow and oxygen consumption. Notably, the nonhealed patients in group C showed paradoxically reduced hemoglobin and tissue blood volume after the exercises.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although DFUs remain a challenge to treat, NIRS may prove valuable in predicting wound healing by identifying risk factors for poor wound prognosis, such as reduced hemoglobin and tissue blood volume after exercise.

AB  - Continuous and longitudinal monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in animal models provides information for studying the mechanisms and interventions of various cerebral diseases. Since anesthesia may affect brain hemodynamics, researchers have been seeking wearable devices for use in conscious animals. We present a wearable diffuse speckle contrast flowmeter (DSCF) probe for monitoring CBF variations in mice. The DSCF probe consists of a small low-power near-infrared laser diode as a point source and an ultrasmall low-power CMOS camera as a two-dimensional detector array, which can be affixed on a mouse head. The movement of red blood cells in brain cortex (i.e., CBF) produces spatial fluctuations of laser speckles, which are captured by the camera. The DSCF system was calibrated using tissue phantoms and validated in a human forearm and mouse brains for continuous monitoring of blood flow increases and decreases against the established technologies. Significant correlations were observed among these measurements (R-2 >= 0.80, p < 14(-5)). This small fiberless probe has the potential to be worn by a freely moving conscious mouse. Moreover, the flexible source-detector configuration allows for varied probing depths up to similar to 8 mm, which is sufficient for transcranially detecting CBF in the cortices of rodents and newborn infants.

AB  - Background The anterior-posterior ground reaction force (AP-GRF) and propulsion and braking point metrics derived from the AP-GRF time series are indicators of locomotor function across healthy and neurological diagnostic groups. In this paper, we describe the use of a minimal set of wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) to indirectly measure the AP-GRFs generated during healthy and hemiparetic walking. Methods Ten healthy individuals and five individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis completed a 6-minute walk test over a walking track instrumented with six forceplates while wearing three IMUs securely attached to the pelvis, thigh, and shank. Subject-specific models driven by IMU-measured thigh and shank angles and an estimate of body acceleration provided by the pelvis IMU were used to generate indirect estimates of the AP-GRF time series. Propulsion and braking point metrics (i.e., peaks, peak timings, and impulses) were extracted from the IMU-generated time series. Peaks and impulses were expressed as % bodyweight (%bw) and peak timing was expressed as % stance phase (%sp). A 75%-25% split of 6-minute walk test data was used to train and validate the models. Indirect estimates of the AP-GRF time series and point metrics were compared to direct measurements made by the forceplates. Results Indirect measurements of the AP-GRF time series approximated the direct measurements made by forceplates, with low error and high consistency in both the healthy (RMSE= 4.5%bw;R-2= 0.93) and post-stroke (RMSE= 2.64%bw;R-2= 0.90) cohorts. In the healthy cohort, the average errors between indirect and direct measurements of the peak propulsion magnitude, peak propulsion timing, and propulsion impulse point estimates were 2.37%bw, 0.67%sp, and 0.43%bw. In the post-stroke cohort, the average errors for these point estimates were 1.07%bw, 1.27%sp, and 0.31%bw. Average errors for the braking estimates were higher, but comparable. Conclusions Accurate estimates of AP-GRF metrics can be generated using three strategically mounted IMUs and subject-specific calibrations. This study advances the development of point-of-care diagnostic systems that can catalyze the routine assessment and management of propulsion and braking locomotor deficits during rehabilitation.

AB  - Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia. Studies on MCI progression are important for Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevention. 18F fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been proven to be a powerful tool for measuring cerebral glucose metabolism. In this study, we proposed a classification framework for MCI prediction with both baseline and multiple follow-up FDG-PET scans as well as cognitive scores of 33 progressive MCI (pMCI) patients and 46 stable MCI (sMCI) patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Method First, PET images were normalized using the Yakushev normalization procedure and registered to the Brainnetome Atlas (BNA). The average metabolic intensities of brain regions were defined as static features. Dynamic features were the intensity variation between baseline and the other three time points and change ratios with the intensity obtained at baseline considered as reference. Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and Alzheimer's disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive section (ADAS-cog) scores of each time point were collected as cognitive features. And F-score was applied for feature selection. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) with radial basis function (RBF) kernel was used for the three above features. Results Dynamic features showed the best classification performance in accuracy of 88.61% than static features (accuracy of 78.48%). And the combination of cognitive features and dynamic features improved the classification performance in specificity of 95.65% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.9308. Conclusion Our results reported that dynamic features are more representative in longitudinal research for MCI prediction work. And dynamic features and cognitive scores complementarily enhance the classification performance in specificity and AUC. These findings may predict the disease course and clinical changes in individuals with mild cognitive impairment.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced into medicine and an AI-assisted medicine will be the future that we should help to shape. In particular, supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning will be the main methods to play a role in the implementation of AI. Severely ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are closely monitored in order to be able to quickly respond to any changes. These monitoring data can be used to train AI models to predict critical phases in advance, making an earlier reaction possible. To achieve this a large amount of clinical data are needed in order to train models and an external validation on independent cohorts should take place. Prospective studies with treatment of patients admitted to the ICU with AI assistance should show that they provide a benefit for patients. We present the most important resources from de-identified (anonymized) patient data on open-source use for AI research in intensive care medicine. The focus is on neurological diseases in the ICU, therefore, we provide an overview of existing models for prediction of outcome, vasospasms, intracranial pressure and levels of consciousness. To introduce the advantages of AI in the clinical routine, more AI-based models with larger datasets will be needed. To achieve this international cooperation is absolutely necessary. Clinical centers associated with universities are needed to provide a constant validation of applied models as these models can change during use or a bias can develop during the training. A strong commitment to AI research is important for Germany, not only with respect to academic achievements but also in the light of a rapidly growing influence of AI on the economy.

AB  - In current trends of smart wearables, there are lot of smart devices for healthcare systems. Among them the detection of Glucose from the patient is tested using blood sample by pricking the finger. This paper demonstrates a device to test the blood glucose level using non-invasive method of not pricking the finger. A Node MCU 32S is used as microcontroller to obtain the readings from the blood glucose detector, temperature sensor and heart rate sensor. The Glucose detector contains PIC16LF178X chip and has two electrodes to send and receive data bits. The electrodes are placed on the tongue where one electrode sends a certain bit of data. The data bits when passed through the blood in the tongue, certain amount is lost due to the presence of glucose. The remaining bits are detected at the second electrode. The difference between these values gives the amount of glucose in the blood. The temperature sensor detects body temperature. The pulse sensor detects the heart rate and blood pressure. These readings are displayed on the mobile application which is connected to the microcontroller via interne. Based on these readings, the microcontroller sends alerts in the mobile application. The dietary suggestions are given to the patient through the mobile application in order to maintain normal glucose levels and also to reduce in times of high glucose levels. A list of foods which should be taken is displayed on the mobile application

AB  - Context. Quality of life (QoL) is increasingly recognized as an important outcome of cancer treatment. Previous studies have examined clinical predictors of QoL, but with the increasing prevalence of wearable sensors that monitor sleep and activity patterns, further investigation into whether these behaviors are predictive of post-treatment QoL is now feasible. Among patients receiving aggressive cancer treatment such as hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), analysis of circadian rhythms (24-hour patterns of sleep and activity) via wearable sensors is limited.
   Objective. To evaluate the relationship between overall QoL and circadian rhythms in patients receiving allogeneic HCT.
   Methods. Patients wore an ActiGraph GT3X (Pensacola, FL) activity monitor for at least 72 hours before the initiation of conditioning chemotherapy and transplantation and completed a QoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]) assessment. QoL assessments were also completed 1, 3, and 6 months after HCT.
   Results. Patients (n = 45, M age = 55) were mostly male (66%) with a total FACT-G score of 80.96 (SD = 16.05) before HCT. Mixed models revealed robust cross-sectional associations between overall QoL and multiple circadian rhythmicity parameters, including durations of high physical activity, overall circadian rhythmicity, and earlier starts of daily activity (P's <. 01). Recovery of QoL after transplant was predicted by longer pre-transplant durations of high physical activity (P = .04) and earlier evening retirement (P = .04).
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest that wearable sensor information is a promising method of predicting recovery of QoL after HCT. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings in a larger sample. (C) 2019 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundIdentification of silent atrial fibrillation (AF) could prevent stroke and other sequelae.
   HypothesisScreening for AF using continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring can detect silent AF in asymptomatic in patients with known risk factors.
   MethodsWe performed a single-center prospective screening study using a wearable patch-based device that provides up to 2 weeks of continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring (iRhythm Technologies, Inc.). Inclusion criteria were age 55 years and 2 of the following risk factors: coronary disease, heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea. We excluded patients with prior AF, stroke, transient ischemic attack, implantable pacemaker or defibrillator, or with palpitations or syncope in the prior year.
   ResultsOut of 75 subjects (all male, age 69 8.0 years; ejection fraction 57% +/- 8.7%), AF was detected in 4 subjects (5.3%; AF burden 28% +/- 48%). Atrial tachycardia (AT) was present in 67% (4 beats), 44% (8 beats), and 6.7% (60 seconds) of subjects. The combined diagnostic yield of sustained AT/AF was 11%. In subjects without sustained AT/AF, 11 (16%) had 30 supraventricular ectopic complexes per hour.
   Conclusions Outpatient extended ECG screening for asymptomatic AF is feasible, with AF identified in 1 in 20 subjects and sustained AT/AF identified in 1 in 9 subjects, respectively. We also found a high prevalence of asymptomatic AT and frequent supraventricular ectopic complexes, which may be relevant to development of AF or stroke. If confirmed in a larger study, primary screening for AF could have a significant impact on public health.

TI  - An IoT-Aware Architecture for Collecting and Managing Data Related to Elderly Behavior
T2  - WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA  - English
KW  - THINGS
AB  - The world population will be made up of a growing number of elderly people in the near future. Aged people are characterized by some physical and cognitive diseases, like mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and frailty, that, if not timely diagnosed, could turn into more severe diseases, like Alzheimer disease, thus implying high costs for treatments and cares. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) enabling the Internet of Things (IoT) can be adopted to create frameworks for monitoring elderly behavior which, alongside normal clinical procedures, can help geriatricians to early detect behavioral changes related to such pathologies and to provide customized interventions. As part of the City4Age project, this work describes a novel approach for collecting and managing data about elderly behavior during their normal activities. The data capturing layer is an unobtrusive and low-cost sensing infrastructure abstracting the heterogeneity of physical devices, while the data management layer easily manages the huge quantity of sensed data, giving them semantic meaning and fostering data shareability. This work provides a functional validation of the proposed architecture and introduces how the data it manages can be used by the whole City4Age platform to early identify risks related to MCI/frailty and promptly intervene.

AB  - Background: Stroke survivors often suffer from mobility deficits. Current clinical evaluation methods, including questionnaires and motor function tests, cannot provide an objective measure of the patients' mobility in daily life. Physical activity performance in daily-life can be assessed using unobtrusive monitoring, for example with a single sensor module fixed on the trunk. Existing approaches based on inertial sensors have limited performance, particularly in detecting transitions between different activities and postures, due to the inherent inter-patient variability of kinematic patterns. To overcome these limitations, one possibility is to use additional information from a barometric pressure (BP) sensor.
   Methods: Our study aims at integrating BP and inertial sensor data into an activity classifier in order to improve the activity (sitting, standing, walking, lying) recognition and the corresponding body elevation (during climbing stairs or when taking an elevator). Taking into account the trunk elevation changes during postural transitions (sit-to-stand, stand-to-sit), we devised an event-driven activity classifier based on fuzzy-logic.
   Data were acquired from 12 stroke patients with impaired mobility, using a trunk-worn inertial and BP sensor. Events, including walking and lying periods and potential postural transitions, were first extracted. These events were then fed into a double-stage hierarchical Fuzzy Inference System (H-FIS). The first stage processed the events to infer activities and the second stage improved activity recognition by applying behavioral constraints. Finally, the body elevation was estimated using a pattern-enhancing algorithm applied on BP. The patients were videotaped for reference. The performance of the algorithm was estimated using the Correct Classification Rate (CCR) and F-score. The BP-based classification approach was benchmarked against a previously-published fuzzy-logic classifier (FIS-IMU) and a conventional epoch-based classifier (EPOCH).
   Results: The algorithm performance for posture/activity detection, in terms of CCR was 90.4 %, with 3.3 % and 5.6 % improvements against FIS-IMU and EPOCH, respectively. The proposed classifier essentially benefits from a better recognition of standing activity (70.3 % versus 61.5 % [FIS-IMU] and 42.5 % [EPOCH]) with 98.2 % CCR for body elevation estimation.
   Conclusion: The monitoring and recognition of daily activities in mobility-impaired stoke patients can be significantly improved using a trunk-fixed sensor that integrates BP, inertial sensors, and an event-based activity classifier.

AB  - The detection of Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizures (GTCS) and Falls is of utmost importance due to the increase in prevalence of epilepsy and Sudden Death in Epileptic Patients during CoVID-19 pandemic, and prevention of serious injuries in Fall risk groups such as elderly requiring continuous monitoring for disease management and assisted living etc. Monitoring of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) can assist in the detection of symptoms and onset of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's, stroke, and epileptic seizures. With a host of embedded sensors, improved memory, enhanced processing capabilities and availability to masses, smartphones can be used for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) through continuous monitoring of ADLs. This paper presents a tri-axial accelerometer-based approach to detect and classify activities performed by individuals by applying machine learning algorithms including RF, J48, NB, LMT and SVM to movement data. Movement data is collected in real-time from the embedded accelerometer of a smartphone worn by individual on upper-left arm in unconstraint environment. It is pre-processed using time and frequency domain analysis and spatial domain features are computed. Supervised machine learning techniques are applied to classify ADLs into five classes based on the intensity of movements: Stationary, Light Ambulatory, Intense Ambulatory, GTCS and Falls. We also used training data from MyNeuroHealth dataset collected from 23 individuals including epilepsy patients. Based on gathered results, Random Forest outperforms other classifiers with classification accuracy of 99.6% for stationary, 81.5% for light ambulatory, 99.8% for intense ambulatory and GTCS, and 97.2% for Falls corresponding to training data of 14000 samples. To date, activity classification in our system has been implemented on cloud instead of mobile phone application as subjects are using smartphones with dissimilar software and hardware specifications for assisted living applications.

AB  - Objective: Long-term monitoring of epilepsy patients outside of hospital settings is impractical due to the complexity and costs associated with electroencephalogram (EEG) systems. Alternative sensing modalities that can acquire, and automatically interpret signals through easy-to-use wearable devices, are needed to help with at-home management of the disease. In this paper, a novel machine learning algorithm is presented for detecting epileptic seizures using acoustic physiological signals acquired from the neck using a wearable device. Methods: Acoustic signals from an existing database, were processed, to extract their Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) which were used to train RUSBoost classifiers to identify ictal and non-ictal acoustic segments. A postprocessing stage was then applied to the segment classification results to identify seizures episodes. Results: Tested on 667 hours of acoustic data acquired from 15 patients with at least one seizure, the algorithm achieved a detection sensitivity of 88.1% (95% CI: 79%-97%) from a total of 36 seizures, out of which 24 had no motor manifestations, with a FPR of 0.83/h, and a median detection latency of -42 s. Conclusion: The results demonstrated for the first time the ability to identify seizures using acoustic internal body signals acquired on the neck. Significance: The results of this paper validate the feasibility of using internal physiological sounds for seizure detection, which could potentially be of use for the development of novel, wearable, very simple to use, long term monitoring, or seizure detection systems; circumventing the practical limitations of EEG monitoring outside hospital settings, or systems based on sensing modalities that work on convulsive seizures only.

AB  - Objective: Tremor is a clinically depicted commonly encountered neurological disorder which results after a stroke or brain injury like Parkinson's disease which causes rhythmic and reflex oscillatory movement of a body, particularly upper arm, which is difficult to diagnose and manage. Tremor is influenced by Physiological and Psychological factors which can affect any age group specifically in middle age and older persons. The modern treatment facilities and features available are very expensive and unreachable for rural people. Hence there arises a necessity to develop a portable device to overcome such situations. Methods: This paper introduces a portable and wearable device using accelerometer sensor assisted with pneumatic mechanism for tremor suppression in the upper arm. This portable device may help to suppress tremor and improve muscle control and coordination in the upper arm. Once the device is connected with the patients arm, the pneumatic circuit supplies required air through the hand cuff to keep the arm on control with reference to the signal obtained from the accelerometer sensor. The results: The performances of the device are measured in three different stages say before inflation, during partial inflation and full inflation. The results depicts 30% of improvement in tremor suppression at three different levels of tremor occurrence which is measured in terms of voltage between 1.6 and 2V at high, medium and low levels at different time intervals with frequency <10Hz. Conclusion: This device is a cost effective and portable closed loop system which is exclusively designed to reduce the tremor without affecting the upper limb voluntary movements.

KW  - HYDROGEL
AB  - Wearable strain, pressure, and temperature sensors have tremendous potential applications in human motion detection and personal healthcare monitoring. However, it is a challenge to design a flexible and wearable sensor which unifies multifaced properties, such as favorable adhesion, high transparency and stretchability, self-healing capability, and the ability to detect a change in strain, pressure or temperature with high sensitivity. Here, we resolve this long-standing mismatch through a physical crosslinking design. A stable ionogel is fabricated by facilely mixing ionic liquid (IL) with allyl monomers, and then initiating polymerization by UV light without covalent crosslinking. The obtained ionogel shows good self-healing capability and adhesion, excellent stretchability (2017%), high durability (1000 cycles at 50% strain), environmental tolerance (thermal stability and vacuum stability) and high transparency (92%, 1 mm). The assembled ionogel-based strain sensor exhibits a wide strain response range (600%) and excellent reproducibility (1000 cycles). More interestingly, the ionogel-based sensor can be assembled into a sensor for recognition of written strokes and a tapping sensor with high accuracy, providing a means for the transmission of secret information. Based on the temperature-dependent conductivity of IL, the ionogel is designed as a temperature sensor with a wide operating window (-20 to 120 degrees C), an ultralow detection limit (0.1 degrees C), and high sensitivity (4% degrees C-1). By virtue of its remarkable sensing abilities in terms of strain and temperature, this ionogel-based sensor can not only detect the strain deformation caused by subtle changes in facial expression and large joint bending but also detect tiny changes in temperature, which suggest great promise in wearable devices and electronics.

AB  - Background: As virtual reality (VR) technologies become increasingly accessible and affordable, clinicians are eager to try VR therapy as a novel means to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which are exacerbated during acute care hospitalization, with the goal of reducing the use of antipsychotics, sedatives, and physical restraints associated with negative adverse effects, increased length of stay, and caregiver burden. To date, no evaluations of immersive VR therapy have been reported for patients with dementia in acute care hospitals.
   Objective: This study aimed to determine the feasibility (acceptance, comfort, and safety) of using immersive VR therapy for people living with dementia (mild, moderate, and advanced) during acute care hospitalization and explore its potential to manage behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.
   Methods: A prospective, longitudinal pilot study was conducted at a community teaching hospital in Toronto. The study was nonrandomized and unblinded. A total of 10 patients aged >65 years (mean 86.5, SD 5.7) diagnosed with dementia participated in one or more research coordinator-facilitated sessions of viewing immersive 360 degrees VR footage of nature scenes displayed on a Samsung Gear VR head-mounted display. This mixed-methods study included review of patient charts, standardized observations during the intervention, and pre- and postintervention semistructured interviews about the VR experience.
   Results: All recruited participants (N=10) completed the study. Of the 10 participants, 7 (70%) displayed enjoyment or relaxation during the VR session, which averaged 6 minutes per view, and 1 (10%) experienced dizziness. No interference between the VR equipment and hearing aids or medical devices was reported.
   Conclusions: It is feasible to expose older people with dementia of various degrees admitted to an acute care hospital to immersive VR therapy. VR therapy was found to be acceptable to and comfortable by most participants. This pilot study provides the basis for conducting the first randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of VR therapy on managing behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in acute care hospitals.

AB  - A frequent cardiac rhythm disorder, atrial fibrillation (AF), is associated with considerable cardiovascular risk, morbidity, and mortality. AF can lead to a stroke and heart failure by a factor of five. Early detection of AF is critical to prevent severe heart failure, however, AF remains undetected in patients as check-ups are too brief and continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm is often limited. Because of recent advancements in technology, we are now able to monitor cardiac rhythm more consistently in patients with wearable devices. Many wearable devices are wrist-wearable and use photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to detect AF due to their accessibility and applicability. However, acquiring a clean PPG signal directly from the wrist is challenging and subject to various motion artifacts which greatly interferes with the AF detection capabilities of these sensors. Even though, the PPG signal is often correlated with accelerometer data, deep learning algorithms, filtering methods, etc., it is challenging to overcome the motion artifact limitations. For this reason, new devices, immune to motion artifacts, are necessary. In this purpose, we developed a new aerogel-based nano-tattoo that acquires robust heart rate signals directly from the wrist, while reliably detecting AF, during extreme upper extremity motions, such as arm swing, repetitive elbow flexion/extension, waving, etc., using artificial intelligence based neural networks.

AB  - A multi-source information fusion-based disease class classification of stroke patients was implemented to address the low classification accuracy of pure input motion and electromyographic signals. sEMG sensor MYO arm ring and wearable wireless motion sensor Shimmer were used as data acquisition devices. The Butterworth high-pass filter filtering and envelope thresholding method detected the activity segment. Detection and FIR filtering using the window function method remove interference from the motion signal. A weighted cross -validation-based feature selection (W-CVFS) method is proposed for feature fusion selection. The top 10 fea-tures selected by the W-CVFS method and all 18 features are input to the deep neural network for training and testing, and the feature classification result of the W-CVFS method is 79.17%, which is better than the existing mRMR method (66.67%) and ILFS method (62.50%). The classificatip9uon accuracy of multi-source information fusion was 95.385%, which was higher than that of a single input motion signal or sEMG. The experiments showed that the proposed method can retain the features that have more influence on the classification results and can improve the classification accuracy of the rehabilitation model for stroke patients.

AB  - The objective of this study was to discuss the health management of elderly patients in the community and the management of community rehabilitation under the support of the new Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT technology was adopted to monitor the wearable devices through mobile medical physiological data. The heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and other physiological indicators of the elderly were collected in real time. The support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was selected as the core algorithm for the elderly physiological index disease risk assessment, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method was adopted as the core method of the elderly disease risk quantitative assessment model to process the physiological indicators, and finally, a reasonable physiological index processing model and quantitative indicators of disease risk were obtained. The data on vascular disease were selected from the MIMIC database. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the SVM algorithm and the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) algorithm were compared and analysed. The final verification results showed that the fusion accuracy of the SVM processing MIMIC database and the University of California Irvine (UCI) dataset was 0.8327 and 0.8045, respectively, while the fusion accuracy of the BPNN algorithm in processing the same data was 0.7792 and 0.7288, respectively. It was obvious that the fusion accuracy of the SVM algorithm was higher than that of the BPNN algorithm, and the accuracy difference of the SVM algorithm was lower than that of the BPNN algorithm in different groups of data. In the verification of the elderly disease risk quantitative assessment model, the results were consistent with the selected data, which verified the effectiveness of the design model in this study. Therefore, it can be used as a quantitative assessment model of general elderly physiological indicators of disease risk and can be applied to the community medical communication management system. It proved that the model of medical communication and rehabilitation services for elderly patients in the community constructed in this study can definitely help the development of community service for the elderly.

AB  - Featured Application The proposed method can improve the accuracy of an existing parameter-optimized CNN for ECG pattern classification. Especially, by applying the proposed method to single ECG-based analysis, the existing accuracy can be improved to a level similar to, or higher than, that of multi-ECG-based analysis. Since wearable devices, such as smart watches, mainly measure a single ECG stream, the proposed method can be applied to the core technologies of wearables-based smart hospital or healthcare services. In addition to aiding heart disease diagnoses, it can be applied to various IoT services, based on general analyses using ECG. ECG pattern classification for identifying the progress status of various heart diseases is a typical nonlinear problem. Therefore, deep learning-based automatic ECG diagnosis is being widely studied, and for this purpose, the CNN is mainly used to classify ECG patterns. In this case, it is hard to expect any further improvement in accuracy after optimizing the parameters. We propose a shallow domain knowledge injection method that can improve the accuracy of the existing parameter-optimized CNN. The proposed method can improve the accuracy by effectively injecting shallow domain knowledge, that can be acquired by non-medical experts, into the existing parameter-optimized CNN. The experiments show that the proposed method can be applied to both heart disease diagnoses and general ECG classification tasks, while improving the existing accuracy for both types of tasks.

AB  - Exponential growth of large scale data industrial internet of things is evident due to the enormous deployment of IoT data acquisition devices. Detection of unusual patterns from large scale IoT data is important though challenging task. Recently, one-class support vector machines is extensively being used for anomaly detection. It tries to find an optimal hyperplane in high dimensional data that best separates the data from anomalies with maximum margin. However, the hinge loss of traditional one class support vector machines is unbounded, which results in larger loss caused by outliers affecting its performance for anomaly detection. Furthermore, existing methods are computationally complex for larger data. In this paper, we present novel anomaly detection for large scale data by using randomized nonlinear features in support vector machines with bounded loss function rather than finding optimized support vectors with unbounded loss function. Extensive experimental evaluation on ten benchmark datasets shows the robustness of the proposed approach against outliers such as 0.8239, 0.7921 , 0.7501, 0.6711 , 0.6692, 0.4789 , 0.6462 , 0.6812 , 0.7271 and 0.7873 accuracy for Gas Sensor Array, Human Activity Recognition, Parkinson's, Hepatitis, Breast Cancer, Blood Transfusion , Heart, ILPD and Wholesale Customers datasets respectively. In addition to this, introduction of randomized nonlinear feature helps to considerably decrease the computational complexity and space complexity from O(N-3) to O(Bkn) and O(N-2) to O(Bkn). Thus, very attractive for larger datasets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The eye is a complex sensory organ that contains abundant information for specific diseases and pathological responses. It has emerged as a facile biological interface for wearable healthcare platforms because of its excellent accessibility. Recent advances in electronic devices have led to the extensive research of point-of-care (POC) systems for diagnosing and monitoring diseases by detecting the biomarkers within the eye. Among these systems, contact lenses, which make direct contact with the ocular surfaces, have been utilized as one of the promising candidates for non-invasive POC testing of various diseases. The continuous and long-term measurement from the sensor allows the patients to manage their symptoms in an effective and convenient way. Herein, we review the progress of contact lens sensors in terms of the materials, methodologies, device designs, and target biomarkers. The anatomical structure and biological mechanisms of the eye are also discussed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the principles of contact lens sensors. Intraocular pressure and glucose, which are the representative biomarkers found in the eyes, can be measured with the biosensors integrated with contact lenses for the diagnosis of glaucoma and diabetes. Furthermore, contact lens sensors for various general pathologies as well as other ocular diseases are also considered, thereby providing the prospects for further developments of smart contact lenses as a future POC system.

AB  - Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) is vital for screening cardiovascular activity. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of BP in adults recommends measuring BP outside the office setting using daytime ABPM. The recommendation to use night-day BP measurements to confirm hypertension is consistent with the recommendation of several other guidelines. In recent studies, ABPM was used to measure BP at regular intervals, and it reduces the effect of the environment on BP. Out-of-office measurements are highly recommended by almost all hypertension organizations. However, traditional ABPM devices based on the oscillometric technique usually interrupt sleep. For all-day ABPM purposes, a photoplethysmography (PPG)-based wrist-type device has been developed as a convenient tool. This optical, noninvasive device estimates BP using morphological characteristics from PPG waveforms. As measurement can be affected by multiple variables, calibration is necessary to ensure that the calculated BP values are accurate. However, few studies focused on adaptive calibration. A novel adaptive calibration model, which is data-driven and embedded in a wearable device, was proposed. The features from a 15 s PPG waveform and personal information were input for estimation of BP values and our data-driven calibration model. The model had a feedback calibration process using the exponential Gaussian process regression method to calibrate BP values and avoid inter- and intra-subject variability, ensuring accuracy in long-term ABPM. The estimation error of BP (Delta BP = actual BP-estimated BP) of systolic BP was -0.1776 +/- 4.7361 mmHg; <= 15 mmHg, 99.225%, and of diastolic BP was -0.3846 +/- 6.3688 mmHg; <= 15 mmHg, 98.191%. The success rate was improved, and the results corresponded to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation standard and British Hypertension Society Grading criteria for medical regulation. Using machine learning with a feedback calibration model could be used to assess ABPM for clinical purposes.

AB  - Automatic recognition of activities of daily living (ADL) is an important component in understanding of energy balance, quality of life, and other areas of health and well-being. In our previous work, we had proposed an insole-based activity monitor-SmartStep, designed to be socially acceptable and comfortable. The goals of the current study were: first, validation of SmartStep in recognition of a broad set of ADL; second, comparison of the SmartStep to a wrist sensor and testing these in combination; third, evaluation of SmartStep's accuracy in measuring wear noncompliance and a novel activity class (driving); fourth, performing the validation in free living against a well-studied criterion measure (ActivPAL, PAL Technologies); and fifth, quantitative evaluation of the perceived comfort of SmartStep. The activity classification models were developed from a laboratory study consisting of 13 different activities under controlled conditions. Leave-one-out cross validation showed 89% accuracy for the combined SmartStep and wrist sensor, 81% for the SmartStep alone, and 69% for the wrist sensor alone. When household activities were grouped together as one class, SmartStep performed equally well compared to the combination of SmartStep and wrist-worn sensor (90% versus 94%), whereas the accuracy of the wrist sensor increased marginally (73% from 69%). SmartStep achieved 92% accuracy in recognition of nonwear and 82% in recognition of driving. Participants then were studied for a day under free-living conditions. The overall agreement with ActivPAL was 82.5% (compared to 97% for the laboratory study). The SmartStep scored the best on the perceived comfort reported at the end of the study. These results suggest that insole-based activity sensors may present a compelling alternative or companion to commonly used wrist devices.

AB  - Continuous monitoring of high-risk patients and early prediction of severe outcomes is crucial to prevent avoidable deaths. Current clinical monitoring is primarily based on intermittent observation of vital signs and the early warning scores (EWS). The drawback is lack of time series dynamics and correlations among vital signs. This study presents an approach to real-time outcome prediction based on machine learning from continuous recording of vital signs. Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, pulse rate, respiration rate and peripheral blood oxygen saturation were continuously acquired by wearable devices from 292 post-operative high-risk patients. The outcomes from serious complications were evaluated based on review of patients' medical record. The descriptive statistics of vital signs and patient demographic information were used as features. Four machine learning models K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Boosted Ensemble (BE) were trained and tested. In static evaluation, all four models had comparable prediction performance to that of the state of the art. In dynamic evaluation, the models trained from the static evaluation were tested with continuous data. RF and BE obtained the lower false positive rate (FPR) of 0.073 and 0.055 on nooutcome patients respectively. The four models KNN, DT, RF and BE had area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.62, 0.64, 0.65 and 0.64 respectively on outcome patients. RF was found to be optimal model with lower FPR on no-outcome patients and a higher AUROC on outcome patients. These findings are encouraging and indicate that additional investigations must focus on validating performance in a clinical setting before deployment of the real-time outcome prediction.

AB  - This paper introduces methods to estimate aspects of physical activity and sedentary behavior from three-axis accelerometer data collected with a wrist-worn device at a sampling rate of 32 [Hz] on adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in free-living conditions. In particular, we present two methods able to detect and grade activity based on its intensity and individual fitness as sedentary, mild, moderate or vigorous, and a method that performs activity classification in a supervised learning framework to predict specific user behaviors. Population results for activity level grading show multi-class average accuracy of 99.99%, precision of 98.0 +/- 2.2%, recall of 97.9 +/- 3.5% and F1 score of 0.9 +/- 0.0. As for the specific behavior prediction, our best performing classifier, gave population multi-class average accuracy of 92.43 +/- 10.32%, precision of 92.94 +/- 9.80%, recall of 92.20 +/- 10.16% and F1 score of 92.56 +/- 9.94%. Our investigation showed that physical activity and sedentary behavior can be detected, graded and classified with good accuracy and precision from three-axial accelerometer data collected in free-living conditions on people with T1D. This is particularly significant in the context of automated glucose control systems for diabetes, in that the methods we propose have the potential to inform changes in treatment parameters in response to the intensity of physical activity, allowing patients to meet their glycemic targets.

AB  - This paper focuses on the development of a passive, lightweight skin patch sensor that can measure fluid volume changes in the heart in a non-invasive, point-of-care setting. The wearable sensor is an electromagnetic, self-resonant sensor configured into a specific pattern to formulate its three passive elements (resistance, capacitance, and inductance). In an animal model, a bladder was inserted into the left ventricle (LV) of a bovine heart, and fluid was injected using a syringe to simulate stoke volume (SV). In a human study, to assess the dynamic fluid volume changes of the heart in real time, the sensor frequency response was obtained from a participant in a 30 degrees head-up tilt (HUT), 10 degrees HUT, supine, and 10 degrees head-down tilt positions over time. In the animal model, an 80-mL fluid volume change in the LV resulted in a downward frequency shift of 80.16 kHz. In the human study, there was a patterned frequency shift over time which correlated with ventricular volume changes in the heart during the cardiac cycle. Statistical analysis showed a linear correlation R-2 = 0.98 and 0.87 between the frequency shifts and fluid volume changes in the LV of the bovine heart and human participant, respectively. In addition, the patch sensor detected heart rate in a continuous manner with a 0.179% relative error compared to electrocardiography. These results provide promising data regarding the ability of the patch sensor to be a potential technology for SV monitoring in a non-invasive, continuous, and non-clinical setting.

AB  - Background: Activity trackers are now ubiquitous in certain populations, with potential applications for health promotion and monitoring and chronic disease management. Understanding the accuracy of this technology is critical to the appropriate and productive use of wearables in health research. Although other peer-reviewed validations have examined other features (eg, steps and heart rate), no published studies to date have addressed the accuracy of automatic activity type detection and duration accuracy in wearable trackers.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the ability of 4 commercially available wearable activity trackers (Fitbits Flex 2, Fitbit Alta HR, Fitbit Charge 2, and Garmin Vivosmart HR), in a controlled setting, to correctly and automatically identify the type and duration of the physical activity being performed.
   Methods: A total of 8 activity types, including walking and running (on both a treadmill and outdoors), a run embedded in walking bouts, elliptical use, outdoor biking, and pool lap swimming, were tested by 28 to 34 healthy adult participants (69 total participants who participated in some to all activity types). Actual activity type and duration were recorded by study personnel and compared with tracker data using descriptive statistics and mean absolute percent error (MAPE).
   Results: The proportion of trials in which the activity type was correctly identified was 93% to 97% (depending on the tracker) for treadmill walking, 93% to 100% for treadmill running, 36% to 62% for treadmill running when preceded and followed by a walk, 97% to 100% for outdoor walking, 100% for outdoor running, 3% to 97% for using an elliptical, 44% to 97% for biking, and 87.5% for swimming When activities were correctly identified, the MAPE of the detected duration versus the actual activity duration was between 7% and 7.9% for treadmill walking, 8.7% and 144.8% for treadmill running, 23.6% and 28.9% for treadmill running when preceded and followed by a walk, 4.9% and 11.8% for outdoor walking, 5.6% and 9.6% for outdoor running, 9.7% and 13% for using an elliptical, 9.5% and 17.7% for biking, and was 26.9% for swimming.
   Conclusions: In a controlled setting, wearable activity trackers provide accurate recognition of the type of some common physical activities, especially outdoor walking and running and walking on a treadmill The accuracy of measurement of activity duration varied considerably by activity type and tracker model and was poor for complex sets of activity, such as a run embedded within 2 walking segments.

AB  - Two-dimensional (2D) materials provides large surface area for H2O molecules adsorption and interaction, which has been utilized in humidity sensing and noninvasive monitoring of physiological events such as respiration. However, disadvantages including slow response or modest response hinder the accurate tracking of human breath. Hence, MXene, the new member of 2D material family with excellent hydrophilicity and tunable conductivity, has drawn much attention. In this work, the enhanced response of Ti3C2Tx MXene to H2O molecules was achieved by onion-inspired assembling of Ti3C2Tx MXene and chitosan-quercetin hybrid layer-by-layer. The chitosan-quercetin modified multilayers suppress the degradation of MXene in environment, exhibiting superior response (317 % at 90 % RH), ultrafast response (0.75 s), and long-term stability (more than 15 days). Integrated with a wireless flexible detecting tag, the multilayers realized wearable human respiration monitoring with robust, accurate tracking capacity, offering a facile and feasible method for versatile physiological monitoring based on humidity sensing.

AB  - The second most common cause of diving fatalities is cardiovascular diseases. Monitoring the cardiovascular system in actual underwater conditions is necessary to gain insights into cardiac activity during immersion and to trigger preventive measures. We developed a wearable, current-based electrocardiogram (ECG) device in the eco-system of the FitnessSHIRT platform. It can be used for normal/dry ECG measuring purposes but is specifically designed to allow underwater signal acquisition without having to use insulated electrodes. Our design is based on a transimpedance amplifier circuit including active current feedback. We integrated additional cascaded filter components to counter noise characteristics specific to the immersed condition of such a system. The results of the evaluation show that our design is able to deliver high-quality ECG signals underwater with no interferences or loss of signal quality. To further evaluate the applicability of the system, we performed an applied study with it using 12 healthy subjects to examine whether differences in the heart rate variability exist between sitting and supine positions of the human body immersed in water and outside of it. We saw significant differences, for example, in the RMSSD and SDSD between sitting outside the water (36 ms) and sitting immersed in water (76 ms) and the pNN50 outside the water (6.4%) and immersed in water (18.2%). The power spectral density for the sitting positions in the TP and HF increased significantly during water immersion while the LF/HF decreased significantly. No significant changes were found for the supine position.

AB  - Background: Few studies of the association between prospective falls and sensor-based measures of motor performance and physical activity (PA) have evaluated subgroups of frailty status separately. Objective: To evaluate wearable sensor-based measures of gait, balance, and PA that are predictive of future falls in community-dwelling older adults. Methods: The Arizona Frailty Cohort Study in Tucson, Arizona, followed community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and over (without baseline cognitive deficit, severe movement disorders, or recent stroke) for falls over 6 months. Baseline measures included Fried frailty criteria: in-home and sensor-based gait (normal and fast walk), balance (bi-pedal eyes open and eyes closed), and spontaneous daily PA over 48 h, measured using validated wearable technologies. Results: Of the 119 participants (36% non-frail, 48% pre-frail, and 16% frail), 48 reported one or more fall (47% of non-frail, 33% of pre-frail, and 47% of frail). Although balance deficit and PA were independent fall predictors in pre-frail and frail groups, they were not sensitive to predict prospective falls in the non-frail group. Even though gait performance deteriorated as frailty increased, gait was not a predictor of prospective falls when participants were stratified based on frailty status. In pre-frail and frail participants combined, center of mass sway [odds ratio (OR) = 5.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.6-13.7], PA mean walking bout duration (OR = 1.1, 95% CI 1.0-1.2), PA mean standing bout duration (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.99), and a fall in previous 6 months (OR = 7.3, 95% CI 1.5-36.4) were independent predictors of prospective falls (area under the curve: 0.882). Conclusion: This study suggests that independent predictors of falls are dependent on frailty status. Among sensor-derived parameters, balance deficit, longer typical walking episodes, and shorter typical standing episodes were the most sensitive predictors of prospective falls in the combined pre-frail and frail sample. Gait deficit was not a sensitive fall predictor in the context of frailty status. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The data from lung cancer patients using wearable sensors and clinical assessments after obser-vation is available to predict the disease's recurrence. In recurrence prediction, pervasive data analysis is required to prevent flaws in clinical correlations and data observations. This article proposes a Pervasive Data Analytical Framework (PDAF) for recurrence prediction. The proposed framework incorporates three processes: data segregation using Butterfly Optimisation, feature correlation using Jaya Optimisation, and autoencoder prediction. First, the data from the wear-able sensor is segregated using observation count for its availability and discreteness. It prevents missing errors under different observation sequences for which the correlation rate is determined using the next optimization. In the Jaya optimization process, the features correlate with the clinical assessments to improve precision. The autoencoder predicts the occurrence of previous missing and non-correlated inputs for maximizing the detection rate. Using the proposed framework, the maximum gains of 9.22% in accuracy, 9.29% in detection, and 7.96% in recommendations.

AB  - The evidence that quality of life is a positive variable for the survival of cancer patients has prompted the interest of the health and pharmaceutical industry in considering that variable as a final clinical outcome. Sustained improvements in cancer care in recent years have resulted in increased numbers of people living with and beyond cancer, with increased attention being placed on improving quality of life for those individuals. Connected Health provides the foundations for the transformation of cancer care into a patient-centric model, focused on providing fully connected, personalized support and therapy for the unique needs of each patient. Connected Health creates an opportunity to overcome barriers to health care support among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions. This paper provides an overview of important areas for the foundations of the creation of a new Connected Health paradigm in cancer care. Here we discuss the capabilities of mobile and wearable technologies; we also discuss pervasive and persuasive strategies and device systems to provide multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches for cancer patients for mental well-being, physical activity promotion, and rehabilitation. Several examples already show that there is enthusiasm in strengthening the possibilities offered by Connected Health in persuasive and pervasive technology in cancer care. Developments harnessing the Internet of Things, personalization, patient-centered design, and artificial intelligence help to monitor and assess the health status of cancer patients. Furthermore, this paper analyses the data infrastructure ecosystem for Connected Health and its semantic interoperability with the Connected Health economy ecosystem and its associated barriers. Interoperability is essential when developing Connected Health solutions that integrate with health systems and electronic health records. Given the exponential business growth of the Connected Health economy, there is an urgent need to develop mHealth (mobile health) exponentially, making it both an attractive and challenging market. In conclusion, there is a need for user-centered and multidisciplinary standards of practice to the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of Connected Health interventions in cancer care to ensure their acceptability, practicality, feasibility, effectiveness, affordability, safety, and equity.

AB  - Purpose: With the popularity of wearable mobile devices, increasing numbers of applications use single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), which provides information about heart rate and rhythm to detect cardiac diseases. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice, it is very important to detect AF early. In this study, we propose a Poincare plot-based method for AF detection that has the advantages of requiring few calculations and short detection segments.
   Method: Our method first extracts the first-order differential RR interval (Delta RRI) sequences from a segmented ECG data, and then the polar coordinate transformation is performed on the Poincare plot of the Delta RRI to obtain the phase-based distribution. Two features, the distribution width D-w and the average distribution height D-h are extracted from the phase-based distribution to classify the AF and non AF episodes. Five PhysioNet databases were used for the assessment, which contain 3,843.3 hours of data from 229 subjects. Long Term AF Database was selected as the training set, and the remaining four databases were used as the testing sets.
   Results: In the testing sets, the results yield good sensitivity/specificity (97.91%/99.14%) with 60 second ECG signal segments, which are better than those of the existing the Poincare plot-based methods, and the method also performs well with 20 second ECG signal segments (sensitivity/specificity of 97.28%/98.35%).
   Conclusion: The detection performance of this method is good under different condition, and has the advantage of easy implementation, which makes it promising for application in the detection and monitoring of AF.

AB  - Conventional glucose monitoring methods for the growing numbers of diabetic patients around the world are invasive, painful, costly and, time-consuming. Complications aroused due to the abnormal blood sugar levels in diabetic patients have created the necessity for continuous noninvasive glucose monitoring. This article presents a wearable system for glucose monitoring based on a single wavelength near-infrared (NIR) Photoplethysmography (PPG) combined with machine-learning regression (MLR). The PPG readout circuit consists of a switched capacitor Transimpedance amplifier with 1 M omega gain and a 10-Hz switched capacitor LPF. It allows a DC bias current rejection up to 20 mu A with an input-referred current noise of 7.3 pA/root Hz. The proposed digital processor eliminates motion artifacts, and baseline drifts from PPG signal, extracts six distinct features and finally predicts the blood glucose level using Support Vector Regression with Fine Gaussian kernel (FGSVR) MLR. A novel piece-wise linear (PWL) approach for the exponential function is proposed to realize the FGSVR on-chip. The overall system is implemented using a 180 nm CMOS process with a chip area of 4.0 mm(2) while consuming 1.62 mW. The glucose measurements are performed for 200 subjects with R-2 of 0.937. The proposed system accurately predicts the sugar level with a mean absolute relative difference (mARD) of 7.62%.

AB  - This work proposes a wearable system for the non-invasive measurement of the blood glucose level. In particular, the blood glucose variations are related with the skin resistance measured with a suitable sensor. A microcontroller is aimed to measure, store and transmits on a wireless channel, the blood glucose level in a simple, non-invasive and unsupervised way. The system is particularly useful to monitoring the glucose level in diabetic patients, and to perform the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) useful to identify metabolic diseases and to diagnose diabetes mellitus in the early stage. The preliminary obtained results are quite promising and demonstrated the potentialities of the device as diagnostic and home care tool.

AB  - Background Wearable technology has rapidly entered consumer markets and has health-care potential; however, wearable device data for diverse populations are scarce. We therefore aimed to describe and compare key wearable signals (ie, heart rate, step count, and home blood pressure measurements) across age, sex, race, ethnicity, and clinical phenotypes.
   Methods In the Michigan Predictive Activity & Clinical Trajectories in Health (MIPACT) prospective observational study, we enrolled participants from Michigan Medicine, Ann Abor, MI, USA, and followed them up for at least 90 days. Patients were included if they were aged 18 years or older, were fluent in English, owned an iPhone 6 or newer model with a supported iOS version, and had regular access to the internet throughout the study period. All participants were provided with an Apple Watch Series 3 or 4, an Omron Evolv Wireless Blood Pressure Monitor, and the MyDataHelps study smartphone application. Participants were asked to wear their watch for 12 h per day or longer and to do daily or weekly tasks, including home blood pressure measurements and breathing tasks. Heart rate, blood pressure, step counts, and distance walked were collected. The study was divided into two phases: an intensive 45-day collection phase (phase 1); and a 3-year longitudinal monitoring phase (phase 2). Here we report the first 90 days of data for all participants, which includes all of phase 1 and the first 45 days of phase 2. Participants' electronic health records were used to establish clinical diagnoses for analysis.
   Findings We enrolled 6765 eligible participants between Aug 14, 2018, and Dec 19, 2019, of whom 6454 participants from Michigan Medicine completed the phase 1 study protocol and were included in this analysis (3482 [54%] women and 2972 [46%] men; 3657 [57%] participants were White, with 1094 [17%] Asian and 1090 [17%] Black participants). On days when participants wore their smart watches, median daily watch wear time was 15middot5 h (IQR 14-17). Participants contributed a total of 1 107 320 blood pressure and 202 198 347 heart rate measurements over 90 days, with 172 (SD 50) blood pressure and 31 329 (SD 24 620) heart rate measurements per participant. Mean systolic blood pressure was 122 mm Hg (SD 10) and mean diastolic blood pressure was 77 mm Hg (SD 8), with 167 312 (15%) measurements having a systolic blood pressure higher than 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mm Hg. Mean resting heart rate was 64 beats per min (SD 8). Blood pressure and resting heart rate varied by sex, age, race, and ethnicity, with higher blood pressures in males and lower heart rate in participants aged 65 years or older (p<0middot0001). Participants took 7511 steps per day (SD 2805) and walked 6009 metres per day (SD 2608), varying across demographic and clinical subgroups.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Psychological stress contributes to blood pressure (BP) variability, which is a significant and independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. We compared the effectiveness of a recently developed wearable watch-type BP monitoring (WBPM) device and an ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) device for detecting ambulatory stress-induced BP elevation in 50 outpatients with 1 or more cardiovascular risk factors.
   METHODS
   The WBPM and ABPM were both worn on the subject's nondominant arm. ABPM was measured automatically at 30-minute intervals, and each ABPM measurement was followed by a self-measured WBPM measurement. We also collected self-reported information about situational conditions, including the emotional state of subjects at the time of each BP measurement. We analyzed 642 paired BP readings for which the self-reported emotional state in the corresponding diary entry was happy, calm, anxious, or tense.
   RESULTS
   In a mixed-effect analysis, there were significant differences between the BP values measured during negative (anxious, tense) and positive happy, calm) emotions in both the WBPM (systolic BP [SBP]: 9.3 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001; diastolic BP [DBP]: 8.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, P < 0.001) and ABPM (SBP: 10.7 +/- 2.1 mm Hg, P < 0.001; DBP: 5.6 +/- 1.4 mm Hg, P < 0.001). The absolute BP levels induced by emotional stress selfmeasured by the WBPM were similar to those automeasured by the ABPM (SBP, WBPM: 141.1 +/- 2.7 mm Hg; ABPM: 140.3 +/- 2.7 mm Hg; P = 0.724). The subject's location at the BP measurement was also significantly associated with BP elevation.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The self-measurement by the WBPM could detect BP variability induced by multiple factors, including emotional stress, under ambulatory conditions as accurately as ABPM.

AB  - Continuous heart monitoring is essential for early detection and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, which are key factors for the evaluation of health status in the general population. Therefore, in the future, it will be increasingly important to develop unobtrusive and transparent cardiac monitoring technologies for the population. The possible approaches are the development of wearable technologies or the integration of sensors in daily-life objects. We developed a smart bed for monitoring cardiorespiratory functions during the night or in the case of continuous monitoring of bedridden patients. The mattress includes three accelerometers for the estimation of the ballistocardiogram (BCG). BCG signal is generated due to the vibrational activity of the body in response to the cardiac ejection of blood. BCG is a promising technique but is usually replaced by electrocardiogram due to the difficulty involved in detecting and processing the BCG signals. In this work, we describe a new algorithm for heart parameter extraction from the BCG signal, based on a moving auto-correlation sliding-window. We tested our method on a group of volunteers with the simultaneous co-registration of electrocardiogram (ECG) using a single-lead configuration. Comparisons with ECG reference signals indicated that the algorithm performed satisfactorily. The results presented demonstrate that valuable cardiac information can be obtained from the BCG signal extracted by low cost sensors integrated in the mattress. Thus, a continuous unobtrusive heart-monitoring through a smart bed is now feasible.

AB  - Background
   Psychological distress is common in patients with cardiovascular disease and negatively impacts outcome.
   Hypothesis
   Psychological distress is high in acute high risk cardiac patients eligible for a WCD, and associated with low quality of life. Distress is aggravated by WCD.
   Methods
   Consecutive patients eligible for a WCD were included in the prospective, multicenter "Cologne Registry of External Defibrillator" registry. Quality of life (Short Form-12), depressive symptoms (Beck-Depression Inventory II) and anxiety (State Trait Anxiety Inventory) were assessed at enrollment and 6-weeks, and associations with WCD prescription were analyzed.
   Results
   123 patients (mean [SD] age 59 [+/- 14] years, 75% male) were included, 85 (69%) of whom received a WCD. At enrollment 21% showed clinically significant depressive symptoms and 52% anxiety symptoms, respectively. At 6 weeks, depressive and anxious symptoms significantly decreased to 7% and 25%, respectively. Depressive symptoms at enrollment and changes at 6 weeks showed significant associations with health-related quality of life, whereas anxious symptoms did not. There was a trend for better improvement of depression scores in patients with WCD (mean [SD] change in score points: -4.1 [6.1] vs -1.8 [3.9]; p = 0.09), whereas change of the anxiousness score was not different (-4.6 [9.5]) vs -3.7 [9.1], p = 0.68).
   Conclusion
   In patients eligible for a WCD, depressive and anxiety symptoms were initially common and depressive symptoms showed a strong association with reduced health-related quality of life contributing to their clinical relevance. WCD recipients showed at least similar improvement of depression and anxiety at 6 weeks when compared to non recipients.

AB  - Background. Proportional motor recovery in the upper limb has been investigated, indicating about 70% of the potential for recovery of motor impairment within the first months poststroke. Objective. To investigate whether the proportional recovery rule is applicable for upper-limb somatosensory impairment and to study underlying neural correlates of impairment and outcome at 6 months. Methods. A total of 32 patients were evaluated at 4 to 7 days and 6 months using the Erasmus MC modification of the revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (NSA) for impairment of (1) somatosensory perception (exteroception) and (2) passive somatosensory processing (sharp/blunt discrimination and proprioception); (3) active somatosensory processing was evaluated using the stereognosis component of the NSA. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained within 1 week poststroke, from which lesion load (LL) was calculated for key somatosensory tracts. Results. Somatosensory perception fully recovered within 6 months. Passive and active somatosensory processing showed proportional recovery of 86% (95% CI = 79%-93%) and 69% (95% CI = 49%-89%), respectively. Patients with somatosensory impairment at 4 to 7 days showed significantly greater thalamocortical and insulo-opercular tracts (TCT and IOT) LL (P < .05) in comparison to patients without impairment. Sensorimotor tract disruption at 4 to 7 days did not provide significant contribution above somatosensory processing score at 4 to 7 days when predicting somatosensory processing outcome at 6 months. Conclusions. Our sample of stroke patients assessed early showed full somatosensory perception but proportional passive and active somatosensory processing recovery. Disruption of both the TCT and IOT early after stroke appears to be a factor associated with somatosensory impairment but not outcome.

AB  - Accurate classification of brain tumors is vital for detecting brain cancer in the Medical Internet of Things. Detecting brain cancer at its early stages is a tremendous medical problem, and many researchers have proposed various diagnostic systems; however, these systems still do not effectively detect brain cancer. To address this issue, we proposed an automatic diagnosing framework that will assist medical experts in diagnosing brain cancer and ensuring proper treatment. In developing the proposed integrated framework, we first integrated a Convolutional Neural Networks model to extract deep features from Magnetic resonance imaging. The extracted features are forwarded to a Long Short Term Memory model, which performs the final classification. Augmentation techniques were applied to increase the data size, thereby boosting the performance of our model. We used the hold-out Cross-validation technique for training and validating our method. In addition, we used various metrics to evaluate the proposed model. The results obtained from the experiments show that our model achieved higher performance than previous models. The proposed model is strongly recommended to be used to diagnose brain cancer in Medical Internet of Things healthcare systems due to its higher predictive outcomes.

AB  - Objectives: This paper describes an experience of implementing seamless service trials online and offline by adopting Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on near-field communication (NFC) tags and Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) beacons. The services were provided for both patients and health professionals. Methods: The pilot services were implemented to enhance healthcare service quality, improve patient safety, and provide an effective business process to health professionals in a tertiary hospital in Seoul, Korea. The services to enhance healthcare service quality include healing tours, cancer information/education, psychological assessments, indoor navigation, and exercise volume checking. The services to improve patient safety are monitoring of high-risk inpatients and delivery of real-time health information in emergency situations. In addition, the services to provide an effective business process to health professionals include surveys and web services for patient management. Results: Considering the sustainability of the pilot services, we decided to pause navigation and patient monitoring services until the interference problem could be completely resolved because beacon signal interference significantly influences the quality of services. On the other hand, we had to continue to provide new wearable beacons to high-risk patients because of hygiene issues, so the cost increased over time and was much higher than expected. Conclusions: To make the smart connected hospital services sustainable, technical feasibility (e.g., beacon signal interference), economic feasibility (e.g., continuous provision of new necklace beacons), and organizational commitment and support (e.g., renewal of new alternative medical devices and infrastructure) are required.

TI  - Design and analysis of wearable pupillometer for autonomic neuropathy of diabetic patients
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
LA  - English
KW  - LIGHT
AB  - Diabetes is a familiar disease in modern society. In the early stage of diabetes, symptoms are unobvious, but they usually induce diabetic autonomic neuropathy or, worse, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. Pupillometers are effective instruments for observing human pupils. This article presents a novel wearable pupillometer design, without external light artifacts, and an embedded algorithm with blinking elimination, which investigates autonomic neuropathy through recording pupil dynamics triggered by an external sensitive invisible light source. The pupillometer is experimented on 36 healthy subjects and 10 diabetic patients under four different colors (white, red, green, and blue) as well as two different light intensities: 50 and 500 mcd. Ten parameters derived from pupil diameter, pupil response time, and pupil response speed will be evaluated for the healthy subjects and diabetic patients. The results show that three in four parameters related to pupil diameters, one in four related to light intensities, and one in two related to pupil response speed could have significant differences (p < 0.05) between healthy subjects and diabetic patients. These parameters obtain over 85% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 88% accuracy. The pupillometer is proven reliable, effective, portable, and inexpensive for diagnosing diabetes in an early stage.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Early warning of bacterial and viral infection, prior to the development of overt clinical symptoms, allows not only for improved patient care and outcomes but also enables faster implementation of public health measures (patient isolation and contact tracing). Our primary objectives in this effort are 3-fold. First, we seek to determine the upper limits of early warning detection through physiological measurements. Second, we investigate whether the detected physiological response is specific to the pathogen. Third, we explore the feasibility of extending early warning detection with wearable devices.
   Research Methods: For the first objective, we developed a supervised random forest algorithm to detect pathogen exposure in the asymptomatic period prior to overt symptoms (fever). We used high-resolution physiological telemetry data (aortic blood pressure, intrathoracic pressure, electrocardiograms, and core temperature) from non-human primate animal models exposed to two viral pathogens: Ebola and Marburg (N = 20). Second, to determine reusability across different pathogens, we evaluated our algorithm against three independent physiological datasets from non-human primate models (N = 13) exposed to three different pathogens: Lassa and Nipah viruses and Y. pestis. For the third objective, we evaluated performance degradation when the algorithm was restricted to features derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms to emulate data from a non-invasive wearable device.
   Results: First, our cross-validated random forest classifier provides a mean early warning of 51 +/- 12 h, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Second, our algorithm achieved comparable performance when applied to datasets from different pathogen exposures - a mean early warning of 51 +/- 14 h and AUC of 0.95 +/- 0.01. Last, with a degraded feature set derived solely from ECG, we observed minimal degradation - a mean early warning of 46 +/- 14 h and AUC of 0.91 +/- 0.001.
   Conclusion: Under controlled experimental conditions, physiological measurements can provide over 2 days of early warning with high AUC. Deviations in physiological signals following exposure to a pathogen are due to the underlying host's immunological response and are not specific to the pathogen. Pre-symptomatic detection is strong even when features are limited to ECG-derivatives, suggesting that this approach may translate to non-invasive wearable devices.

AB  - Wound infection is a life-threatening healthcare issue that can cause severe pain, sepsis, and even amputation. Herein, to address the challenges of point-of-care wound analysis, a battery-free, wireless, and wearable smart bandage was developed for bacterial virulence factors detection. Typical biomarkers, sortase A and pyocyanin, corresponding to two major types of bacterial infection, Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were detected with electrochemical differential pulse voltammetry. Ti3C2Tx MXene was applied to the electrode to enhance the sensitivity. Pyocyanin could transfer electrons with the electrode for sensing due to its redox characteristics, while a peptide labeled with the electroactive ferrocene was customized for the specific recognition of sortase A. The integration of near field communication module realized wireless energy harvesting and data transmission with the smartphone. The fully integrated system demonstrated good linearity and high sensitivity, with wide detection ranges of 1 pg/mL to 100 ng/mL for sortase A, and 1 mu M to 100 mu M for pyocyanin. Furthermore, the animal studies indicated the effectiveness of the smart bandage for multi-biomarker profiling of wound. This wearable system provides a noninvasive, convenient, and efficient platform for in situ bacterial virulence factors detection, offering great potential for the management of the infected wound.

AB  - Objectives To describe 6-min walk test (6MWT) outcomes, and to investigate their correlations with cardiopulmonary and lung function among patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) which was not limited to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods We collected patients' demographic data and obtained minute-by-minute 6MWT outcomes. Modified Borg scale was employed to assess patients' dyspnoea, whereas New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification and pulmonary function test were used to evaluate patients' cardiopulmonary functions. Results Heart rate (HR) exhibited a continuous upward trend, while SpO(2) exhibited an overall downward with a slight increase at the fifth minute. The SpO(2) nadir for 70 patients (9.3%) was lower than 80%. Further, the SpO(2) nadir for 78.27% of the participants appeared at the end of the fourth minute. The 6-min walk distance (6MWD) had the strongest correlation with NYHA classification (r=0.82, p<0.01). The ratio of 6MWD to predicted 6MWD was most correlated to forced expiratory volume in the first second (r=0.30, p<0.01) and forced vital capacity (r=0.30, p<0.01). SpO(2) at 3 min had the strongest correlation to patients' diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (r=0.41, p<0.01). We found significant differences in 6MWD (F=2.44, p=0.033), SpO(2) change (F=2.58, p=0.025), HR at 0 min (F=2.87, p=0.014), HR at end of 6 min (F=2.58, p=0.025) and HR zenith (F=2.64, p=0.022) between the subtypes of ILD. Conclusion This observation provided an important evidence regarding oxygen titration. It is better to maintain SpO(2) above 88% for 4 min instead of 3 min. SpO(2) at the third minute was the most valuable predictor of patients' lung function. 6MWD and SpO(2) changes were more discriminative in subtypes.

AB  - Background Due to the nature of their disease, patients with multiple myeloma (MM) often have bone disease-related pain that limits physical activity and diminishes health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Digital health technology with wearables and electronic patient reported outcome (ePRO) tools can provide insights into MM HRQoL. Methods In this prospective observational cohort study conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer in NY, NY, USA, patients with newly diagnosed MM (n = 40) in two cohorts (Cohort A - patients <65 years; Cohort B - patients >= 65 years) were passively remote-monitored for physical activity at baseline and continuously for up to 6 cycles of induction therapy from Feb 20, 2017 to Sep 10, 2019. The primary endpoint of the study was to determine feasibility of continuous data capture, defined as 13 or more patients of each 20-patient cohort compliant with capturing data for >= 16 h of a 24-hr period in >= 60% of days of >= 4 induction cycles. Secondary aims explored activity trends with treatment and association to ePRO outcomes. Patients completed ePRO surveys (EORTC -QLQC30 and MY20) at baseline and after each cycle. Associations between physical activity measurements, QLQC30 and MY20 scores, and time from the start of treatment were estimated using a linear mixed model with a random intercept. Findings Forty patients were enrolled onto study, and activity bioprofiles were compiled among 24/40 (60%) wearable user participants (wearing the device for at least one cycle). In an intention to treat feasibility analysis, 21/40 (53%) patients [12/20 (60%) Cohort A; 9/20 (45%) Cohort B] had continuous data capture. Among data captured, overall activity trended upward cycle over cycle for the entire study cohort (+179 steps/24 h per cycle; p = 0.0014, 95% CI: 68-289). Older patients (age >= 65 years) had higher increases in activity (+260 steps/24 h per cycle; p < 0.0001, 95% CI: -154 to 366) compared to younger patients (+116 steps/24 h per cycle; p = 0.21, 95% CI: -60 to 293). Activity trends associated with improvement of ePRO domains, including physical functioning scores (p < 0.0001), global health scores (p = 0.02), and declining disease burden symptom scores (p = 0.042). Interpretation Our study demonstrates that feasibility of passive wearable monitoring is challenging in a newly diagnosed MM patient population due to patient use. However, overall continuous data capture monitoring remains high among willing user participants. As therapy is initiated, we show improving activity trends, mainly in older patients, and that activity bioprofiles correlate with traditional HRQOL measurements.

AB  - Background: Walking disabilities negatively affect inclusion in society and quality of life and increase the risk for secondary complications. It has been shown that external feedback applied by therapists and/or robotic training devices enables individuals with gait abnormalities to consciously normalize their gait pattern. However, little is known about the effects of a technically-assisted over ground feedback therapy. The aim of this study was to assess whether automatic real-time feedback provided by a shoe-mounted inertial-sensor-based gait therapy system is feasible in individuals with gait impairments after incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI), stroke and in the elderly.
   Methods: In a non-controlled proof-of-concept study, feedback by tablet computer-generated verbalized instructions was given to individuals with iSCI, stroke and old age for normalization of an individually selected gait parameter (stride length, stance or swing duration, or foot-to-ground angle). The training phase consisted of 3 consecutive visits. Four weeks post training a follow-up visit was performed. Visits started with an initial gait analysis (iGA) without feedback, followed by 5 feedback training sessions of 2-3 min and a gait analysis at the end. A universal evaluation and FB scheme based on equidistant levels of deviations from the mean normal value (1 level = 1 standard deviation (SD) of the physiological reference for the feedback parameter) was used for assessment of gait quality as well as for automated adaptation of training difficulty. Overall changes in level over iGAs were detected using a Friedman's Test. Post-hoc testing was achieved with paired Wilcoxon Tests. The users' satisfaction was assessed by a customized questionnaire.
   Results: Fifteen individuals with iSCI, 11 after stroke and 15 elderly completed the training. The average level at iGA significantly decreased over the visits in all groups (Friedman's test, p < 0.0001), with the biggest decrease between the first and second training visit (4.78 +/- 2.84 to 3.02 +/- 2.43, p < 0.0001, paired Wilcoxon test). Overall, users rated the system's usability and its therapeutic effect as positive.
   Conclusions: Mobile, real-time, verbalized feedback is feasible and results in a normalization of the feedback gait parameter. The results form a first basis for using real-time feedback in task-specific motor rehabilitation programs.

AB  - Purpose This study has demonstrated how technology may contribute to integrated care solutions by comparing conventional ward telemetry (WT) to a wearable ECG monitor (S-Patch) to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with stroke. Design/methodology/approach 51 patients admitted for stroke workup were recruited across two major tertiary centres to compare WT monitoring for two days versus S-Patch for four days in the detection of AF. The efficacy to detect AF using both technologies was assessed via data extractions and medical officer review. A matrix was used to measure nursing/patient satisfaction and setup/resource times were assessed. Findings Patients (84-94%) and nursing staff (75-95%) preferred the S-Patch wearable technology. Non-parametric tests indicated significant time saving for removal of S-Patch versus WT [2.2 min vs 5.1 min (p = 0.00)]. Efficacy of S-Patch to detect AF following medical officer review was greater than WT, with seven patients identified with AF by S-Patch versus one using WT. The S-patch had a false positive rate of 78%. Research limitations/implications The S-Patch is sensitive in the detection of AF; however, it showed a high false-positive rate with automated reporting. This study has provided insight into the details of delivery of integrated healthcare using wearable technology. Originality/value The technology and partnership were the first-in-kind in Australia. The S-Patch had a higher detection rate of AF compared to WT which allows patients to be anti-coagulated appropriately for the prevention of further stroke. The results of this study will be ideally placed to inform future policy in integrated healthcare using new technologies.

AB  - EMG signal has a random and stochastic characteristic, so it is difficult to predict the amplitude. Furthermore, the EMG signal depends on the location of the electrode. Therefore, a proper muscle selection determines the system's accuracy value. The purpose of this study was to investigate the exact location of the electrodes to improve the accuracy of the wearable hand exoskeleton trainer based on electromyography (EMG) signal control. The main advantage of the results of this study is that the most dominant muscle was found in the development of a wearable hand exoskeleton based on an EMG signal threshold. Therefore, the model can be controlled using a single electrode pair which can further be applied using a low-cost microcontroller. In this study, ten respondents were involved in the data acquisition. The discovery of the dominant muscle was carried out by investigating the dominant EMG signal in three muscles (Abductor pollicis longus, extensor digitorum) that play a role in the open and close movements of the hand exoskeleton. A dry electrode was used to detect EMG signal activity on the skin surface. The EMG signal was then extracted using the root mean square (RMS) feature. After the evaluation, the results showed that the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle in the rest position produced a higher accuracy value than the other muscles, which was 96.63 +/- 0.67%. In the implementation, the product of this research can be applied for rehabilitation steps in post-stroke patients, which is carried out either in a medical rehabilitation unit or at home independently.

AB  - Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men and women globally. The residual network (ResNet) evolution of electrocardiogram (ECG) technology has contributed to our understanding of cardiac physiology. We propose an artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm based on an improved ResNet for a wearable ECG. The system hardware consists of a wearable ECG with conductive fabric electrodes, a wireless ECG acquisition module, a mobile terminal App, and a cloud diagnostic platform. The algorithm adopted in this study is based on an improved ResNet for the rapid classification of different types of arrhythmia. First, we visualize ECG data and convert one-dimensional ECG signals into two-dimensional images using Gramian angular fields. Then, we improve the ResNet-50 network model, add multistage shortcut branches to the network, and optimize the residual block. The ReLu activation function is replaced by a scaled exponential linear units (SELUs) activation function to improve the expression ability of the model. Finally, the images are input into the improved ResNet network for classification. The average recognition rate of this classification algorithm against seven types of arrhythmia signals (atrial fibrillation, atrial premature beat, ventricular premature beat, normal beat, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, and sinus bradycardia) is 98.3%.

AB  - Purpose Paediatric Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) patients are at greater risk for developing severe hypo and hyperglycaemic events due to poor glycaemic control. To reduce the risk of adverse events, patients need to achieve the best possible glycaemic management through frequent blood glucose monitoring with finger prick or Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems. However, several non-invasive techniques have been proposed aiming at exploiting changes in physiological parameters based on glucose levels. The overall objective of this study is to validate an artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm to detect glycaemic events using ECG signals collected through non-invasive device.Methods This study will enrol T1D paediatric participants who already use CGM. Participants will wear an additional non-invasive wearable device for recording physiological data and respiratory rate. Glycaemic measurements driven through ECG variables are the main outcomes. Data collected will be used to design, develop and validate the personalised and generalized classifiers based on a deep learning (DL) AI algorithm, able to automatically detect hypoglycaemic events by using few ECG heartbeats recorded with wearable devices.Results Data collection is expected to be completed approximately by June 2023. It is expected that sufficient data will be collected to develop and validate the AI algorithm.Conclusion This is a validation study that will perform additional tests on a larger diabetes sample population to validate the previous pilot results that were based on four healthy adults, providing evidence on the reliability of the AI algorithm in detecting glycaemic events in paediatric diabetic patients in free-living conditions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological specimens from patients who have received radiopharmaceuticals are often collected for diagnostic testing and sent to clinical laboratories. Residual radiation has long been assumed to be minimal. However, literature is sparse and may not represent the specimen volumes or spectrum of radionuclides currently seen at National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated cancer centers. This study examined the radiopharmaceuticals associated with patient specimens received in the hospital core laboratory and assessed the potential risk of external radiation exposure to laboratory personnel.
   METHODS: The types and amounts of radiopharmaceuticals administered in a large metropolitan hospital system were retrospectively examined over a 20-month study period. The associated biological specimens sent to the largest core laboratory in the system for testing were evaluated. In addition, manual survey meter assessment of random clinical specimens and weekly wipe tests were performed for 44weeks, and wearable and environmental dosimeters were placed for 6 months.
   RESULTS: Over 11 000 specimens, collected within 5 physical half-lives of radiopharmaceutical administration, were processed by our laboratory. Manual survey meter assessment of random clinical specimens routinely identified radioactive specimens. If held in a closed palm for >2min, many samples could potentially deliver a 0.02 mSv effective dose of radiation.
   CONCLUSIONS: The laboratory regularly receives radioactive patient specimens without radioactive labels. Although the vast majority of these are blood specimens associated with low-dose diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, some samples may be capable of delivering a significant amount of radiation. Recommendations for laboratories associated with NCI cancer centers are given.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The gait recovery is a realist goal in the rehabilitation of almost Stroke patients. Over the last years, the introduction of robotic technologies in gait rehabilitation of stroke patients has had a greatest interest.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate efficacy of Robotic Gait Training (RGT) in chronic stroke patients.
   METHODS: Fourteen chronic stroke patients were divided into two groups. Six patients received RGT, eight patients received traditional gait rehabilitation. Patients were assessed with clinical scales, as well as with gait analysis, at the beginning and at the end of the treatment.
   RESULTS: Significant changes in some clinical scales for both the groups were detected. In the robotic group, patients showed higher percentage changes in the MRC scale (p = 0.020), in the 6MWT (p = 0.043) and in the Ashworth scale (hip: p = 0.008; knee: p = 0.043; ankle: p = 0.043) when compared with the traditional group. With respect to the gait analysis, we did not found any difference neither in the within-group analysis, nor in the between-group analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both rehabilitation treatments do not change the compensatory strategies in chronic patients but the RGT offers to the patients a more intensive and controlled gait training increasing the gait endurance and decreasing spasticity in the lower limb.

AB  - Personalized weight management strategies are gaining interest. However, knowledge is limited regarding eating habits and association with energy intake, and current technologies limit assessment in free-living situations. We assessed associations between eating behavior and time of day with energy intake using a wearable camera under free-living conditions and explored if obesity modifies the associations. Sixteen participants (50% with obesity) recorded free-living eating behaviors using a wearable fish-eye camera for 14 days. Videos were viewed by trained annotators who confirmed number of bites, eating speed, and time of day for each eating episode. Energy intake was determined by a trained dietitian performing 24-h diet recalls. Greater number of bites, reduced eating speed, and increased BMI significantly predicted higher energy intake among all participants (P 0.05, each). There were no significant interactions between obesity and number of bites, eating speed, or time of day (p 0.05). Greater number of bites and reduced eating speed were significantly associated with higher energy intake in participants without obesity. Results show that under free-living conditions, more bites and slower eating speed predicted higher energy intake when examining consumption of foods with beverages. Obesity did not modify these associations. Findings highlight how eating behaviors can impact energy balance and can inform weight management interventions using wearable technology.

AB  - Walking has been demonstrated to improve health in people with diabetes and peripheral arterial disease. However, continuous walking can produce repeated stress on the plantar foot and cause a high risk of foot ulcers. In addition, a higher walking intensity (i.e., including different speeds and durations) will increase the risk. Therefore, quantifying the walking intensity is essential for rehabilitation interventions to indicate suitable walking exercise. This study proposed a machine learning model to classify the walking speed and duration using plantar region pressure images. A wearable plantar pressure measurement system was used to measure plantar pressures during walking. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was adopted to develop a model for walking intensity classification using different plantar region pressure images, including the first toe (T1), the first metatarsal head (M1), the second metatarsal head (M2), and the heel (HL). The classification consisted of three walking speeds (i.e., slow at 0.8 m/s, moderate at 1.6 m/s, and fast at 2.4 m/s) and two walking durations (i.e., 10 min and 20 min). Of the 12 participants, 10 participants (720 images) were randomly selected to train the classification model, and 2 participants (144 images) were utilized to evaluate the model performance. Experimental evaluation indicated that the ANN model effectively classified different walking speeds and durations based on the plantar region pressure images. Each plantar region pressure image (i.e., T1, M1, M2, and HL) generates different accuracies of the classification model. Higher performance was achieved when classifying walking speeds (0.8 m/s, 1.6 m/s, and 2.4 m/s) and 10 min walking duration in the T1 region, evidenced by an F1-score of 0.94. The dataset T1 could be an essential variable in machine learning to classify the walking intensity at different speeds and durations.

AB  - Cancer is the second leading cause of noncommunicable disease deaths in the world. In 2018, there were over 18 million new cancer cases and approximately 10 million people died from the disease globally. In 2019, almost two million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in USA and over 600,000 people are expected to die from the disease. The incidence of cancer is expected to rise because of lifestyle changes and a rapidly aging population. Evidence suggests that early detection is critical to reducing cancer morbidity and mortality. In this paper, the development of an integrated smart wearable and biomarker detection system is proposed to help reduce cancer morbidity and mortality. The potential benefits and limitations of the system are discussed.

AB  - Knowledge Engineering has become essential in the fields of Medical and Health Care with emphasis for helping citizens to improve their health and quality of life. This includes individual methods and techniques in health-related knowledge acquisition and representation and their application in the construction of intelligent systems capable of using the acquired information to improve the patients' health and/or quality of life. Haemato-oncological diseases can provide significant disability and suffering, with severe symptoms and psychological distress. They can create difficulties in fulfilling professional, family and social roles, affecting an individual's quality of life. Health related quality of life (HRQoL) is a subjective concept but there is also an objective component related to physiological indicators. Some of these physiological indicators can be easily assessed by wearable technology such heart rate variability (HRV). This paper introduces an intelligent system to assess, in real-time, potential HRV indices, that can predict HRQoL in lymphoma patients throughout chemotherapy treatment and to account the individuals' variability. The system is based on wearable technology and intelligent processing of the patients' biometric information to assess some quality of life related parameters. A longitudinal study was conducted among 16 lymphoma patients using this intelligent system. Mixed-effect regression models were performed to investigate predictors for and time effects on HRQoL. There were no significant changes in all HRQoL domains over time. Some quality of life domains revealed similar time trends as HRV indices. These HRV indices also have a significant effect on the domains of quality of life.

AB  - The advancement of wearable technologies provides opportunities to continuously track individuals' daily activity levels and sleep patterns over extended periods of time. These data are useful in examining the reciprocal relationships between physical activity and sleep at the intrapersonal level. The purpose of this study is to test the bidirectional relationships between daily activity levels and sleep duration. The current study analyzed activity and sleep data collected from a Fitbit device as part of a 6 month employer-sponsored weight loss program. A total of 105 overweight/obese adults were included (92% female, 70% obese, and 44% Hispanic). Multilevel models were used to examine (a) whether daily active and sedentary minutes predicted that night's sleep duration and (b) whether sleep duration predicted active and sedentary minutes the following day. Potential extended effects were explored by using a 2 day average of the activity minutes/sleep duration as the predictor. No significant relationships between active minutes and sleep duration were found on a daily basis. However, having less sleep over two nights than one's usual level was associated with an increased likelihood of engaging in some physical activity the following day. There was a significant bidirectional negative association between sedentary minutes and sleep duration for both the daily and 2 day models. Data from wearable trackers, such as Fitbit, can be used to investigate the daily within-person relationship between activity levels and sleep duration. Future studies should investigate other sleep metrics that may be obtained from wearable trackers, as well as potential moderators and mediators of daily activity levels and sleep.

AB  - Cardiac complications of diabetes require continuous monitoring since they may lead to increased morbidity or sudden death of patients. In order to monitor clinical complications of diabetes using wearable sensors, a small set of features have to be identified and effective algorithms for their processing need to be investigated. This article focuses on detecting and monitoring cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) in diabetes patients. The authors investigate and compare the effectiveness of classifiers based on the following decision trees: ADTree, J48, NBTree, RandomTree, REPTree, and SimpleCart. The authors perform a thorough study comparing these decision trees as well as several decision tree ensembles created by applying the following ensemble methods: AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, Decorate, Grading, MultiBoost, Stacking, and two multi-level combinations of AdaBoost and MultiBoost with Bagging for the processing of data from diabetes patients for pervasive health monitoring of CAN. This paper concentrates on the particular task of applying decision tree ensembles for the detection and monitoring of cardiac autonomic neuropathy using these features. Experimental outcomes presented here show that the authors' application of the decision tree ensembles for the detection and monitoring of CAN in diabetes patients achieved better performance parameters compared with the results obtained previously in the literature.

AB  - Multifunctional, comprehensive sensing and wear ability are desirable features for next-generation wearable sensors. Wearable sensors that simultaneously monitor human motion and biochemical indexes are increasingly exploited and are a rapidly evolving topic in point-of-care testing, personalized medicine and even artificial intelligence. However, fabricating highly integrated sensors with multiple functions remains challenging. Here, inspired by colorful peacock tail feathers, we designed and fabricated inverse opal carbon (IOC) rod electrodes by scarifying SiO2 colloidal crystal templates and polymerizing a resorcinol-formaldehyde resin. Two parallel pillar electrodes were combined to mimic the barbs of bird feathers. The capillary forces between the pillars caused liquid to flow along the electrode. The unique optical properties of photonic crystals were utilized for fluorescence enhancement sensing of lactoferrin (LF) in tears. The IOC fibers' high porosity enable highly sensitive electrochemical detection and high energy storage capacity. As a proof of concept, the IOC rod-based sensors were attached to eyelids to sense tear LF, glucose content and eye-movement frequency for the purpose of diagnosing diabetes-associated eye diseases. In addition to applications in eye healthcare, our concept offers a solution for hybrid physiological and biochemical monitoring of diseases, such as Huntington's and Parkinson's, that call for full-range diagnosis.

AB  - Background: Contacts between patients, patients and health care workers (HCWs) and among HCWs represent one of the important routes of transmission of hospital-acquired infections (HAI). A detailed description and quantification of contacts in hospitals provides key information for HAIs epidemiology and for the design and validation of control measures.
   Methods and Findings: We used wearable sensors to detect close-range interactions ("contacts") between individuals in the geriatric unit of a university hospital. Contact events were measured with a spatial resolution of about 1.5 meters and a temporal resolution of 20 seconds. The study included 46 HCWs and 29 patients and lasted for 4 days and 4 nights. 14,037 contacts were recorded overall, 94.1% of which during daytime. The number and duration of contacts varied between mornings, afternoons and nights, and contact matrices describing the mixing patterns between HCW and patients were built for each time period. Contact patterns were qualitatively similar from one day to the next. 38% of the contacts occurred between pairs of HCWs and 6 HCWs accounted for 42% of all the contacts including at least one patient, suggesting a population of individuals who could potentially act as super-spreaders.
   Conclusions: Wearable sensors represent a novel tool for the measurement of contact patterns in hospitals. The collected data can provide information on important aspects that impact the spreading patterns of infectious diseases, such as the strong heterogeneity of contact numbers and durations across individuals, the variability in the number of contacts during a day, and the fraction of repeated contacts across days. This variability is however associated with a marked statistical stability of contact and mixing patterns across days. Our results highlight the need for such measurement efforts in order to correctly inform mathematical models of HAIs and use them to inform the design and evaluation of prevention strategies.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted lives and greatly affected the mental health and public safety of an already vulnerable population-college students. Social distancing and isolation measures have presented challenges to students' mental health. mHealth apps and wearable sensors may help monitor students at risk of COVID-19 and support their mental well-being.
   Objective: This study aimed to monitor students at risk of COVID-19 by using a wearable sensor and a smartphone-based survey.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective study on undergraduate and graduate students at a public university in the Midwest United States. Students were instructed to download the Fitbit, Social Rhythms, and Roadmap 2.0 apps onto their personal smartphone devices (Android or iOS). Subjects consented to provide up to 10 saliva samples during the study period. Surveys were administered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at five timepoints: at baseline, 1 month later, 2 months later, 3 months later, and at study completion. The surveys gathered information regarding demographics, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and mental health resilience, with the aim of documenting the impact of COVID-19 on the college student population.
   Results: This study enrolled 2158 college students between September 2020 and January 2021. Subjects are currently being followed-up for 1 academic year. Data collection and analysis are currently underway.
   Conclusions: This study examined student health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and assessed the feasibility of using a wearable sensor and a survey in a college student population, which may inform the role of our mHealth tools in assessing student health and well-being. Finally, using data derived from a wearable sensor, biospecimen collection, and self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis, our results may provide key data toward the development of a model for the early prediction and detection of COVID-19.

AB  - Patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus must monitor their blood glucose levels in order to control the glycaemia. Consequently, they must perform a capillary test at least three times per day and, besides that, a laboratory test once or twice per month. These standard methods pose difficulty for patients since they need to prick their finger in order to determine the glucose concentration, yielding discomfort and distress. In this paper, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based framework for non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is described. The system is based on Raspberry Pi Zero (RPi) energised with a power bank, using a visible laser beam and a Raspberry Pi Camera, all implemented in a glove. Data for the non-invasive monitoring is acquired by the RPi Zero taking a set of pictures of the user fingertip and computing their histograms. Generated data is processed by an artificial neural network (ANN) implemented on a Flask microservice using the Tensorflow libraries. In this paper, all measurements were performed in vivo and the obtained data was validated against laboratory blood tests by means of the mean absolute error (10.37%) and Clarke grid error (90.32% in zone A). Estimated glucose values can be harvested by an end device such as a smartphone for monitoring purposes.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an incurable disease that affects 1. 25 million Americans. Diabetic patients typically rely on subcutaneous insulin infusions to regulate their glucose levels. A major contributor to their blood glucose levels is the amount of sugar intake, which cannot be easily tracked. While ultrasound imaging has been used to investigate the relationship between food characteristics and tongue movement, the technique utilized a bulky transducer array that cannot be translated into daily monitoring. Capitalizing on advanced electronics and data processing technologies, we developed a portable system that utilizes only a single ceramic disk to quantify the tongue movement in response to various levels of sweetness. After acquiring 32 subject datasets, we found a significant correlation between food sweetness and tongue movement. Our system can potentially be miniaturized into a wearable device for monitoring sugar intake, which will ultimately help T1D patients to better monitor and control their blood glucose levels and balance their diets accordingly.

AB  - The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a diagnostic device capable of monitoring normal or irregular heart function. The entire ECG beat can be categorized into five different forms of beat arrhythmias (N, S, V, F, W. Quick and precise diagnosis of forms of arrhythmia is critical for identifying the heart problem and provides the proper treatment to the patient. In this paper, Discrete Wavelet Transform and Higher Order Statistics techniques has been used for analyzing and determining the ECG signals and implement it on an IOT-based platform. This system is based on three categories: The first approach involves inputting the ECG data; the second approach involves extracting the ECG beats with their respective amplitude from the base line. Wavelet transform function, and higher order statistics are used to eliminate noise and unwanted signal components and thus to extract ECG features. The third approach is to classify the ECG beats based on the Incremental Support vector regression classifier. After classification ECG beat is transmitted to the controller section for signal processing are given to controller section (Arduino Uno). The process can be implemented by employing the statistical feature for the feature extraction from the ECG signal. Compared to other approaches, the method provided by Incremental Support vector regression to identify the ECG beats and predict arrhythmia can provide successful detection of arrhythmias. The basic concept of the proposed system is to provide patients with reliable health care by using cloud data compliance to allow doctors to use this information and to provide a fast and feasible service. The findings show that the proposed algorithm is successful in predicting cardiac arrhythmias, with a 98% that is higher than other approaches.

AB  - Screening for atrial fibrillation in high-risk populations could contribute to the prevention of cardioembolic stroke. Randomized trials of atrial fibrillation screening are directionally favourable but underpowered for stroke risk assessment; nevertheless, meta-analysis results are encouraging. Consumer-facing wearable devices can detect unknown atrial fibrillation at scale, although they are mostly used by individuals at low risk of stroke.

AB  - Sensor systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) make it possible to continuously monitor people, gathering information without any extra effort from them. Thus, the IoT can be very helpful in the context of early disease detection, which can improve peoples' quality of life by applying the right treatment and measures at an early stage. This paper presents a new use of IoT sensor systemswe present a novel three-door smart cupboard that can measure the memory of a user, aiming at detecting potential memory losses. The smart cupboard has three sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi, whose aim is to detect which doors are opened. Inside of the Raspberry Pi, a Python script detects the openings of the doors, and classifies the events between attempts of finding something without success and the events of actually finding it, in order to measure the user's memory concerning the objects' locations (among the three compartments of the smart cupboard). The smart cupboard was assessed with 23 different users in a controlled environment. This smart cupboard was powered by an external battery. The memory assessments of the smart cupboard were compared with a validated test of memory assessment about face-name associations and a self-reported test about self-perceived memory. We found a significant correlation between the smart cupboard results and both memory measurement methods. Thus, we conclude that the proposed novel smart cupboard successfully measured memory.

AB  - The relationship between the muscle deoxygenation breakpoint (Deoxy-BP) measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and the respiratory compensation point (RCP) has been well established. This relationship has also been reported using wearable NIRS, however not in locomotor and non-locomotor muscles simultaneously during whole-body cycling exercise. Our aim was to measure muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2) using wearable NIRS sensors, and to compare the Deoxy-BPs at each muscle with RCP during a ramp cycling exercise test. Twenty-two trained female and male cyclists completed a ramp exercise test to task intolerance on a cycling ergometer, at a ramp rate of 1 W every 2 s (30 W/min). SmO2 was recorded at the subjects' right vastus lateralis (VL) and right lateral deltoid. SmO2 and the Deoxy-BPs were assessed using a piecewise double-linear regression model. Ventilation (V?(E)) and gas exchange were recorded, and RCP was determined from V?(E) and gas exchange using a V-slope method and confirmed by two physiologists. The SmO2 profiles of both muscles and gas exchange responses are reported as V?O-2, power output (W), and time of occurrence (TO). SmO2 profiles at both muscles displayed a near-plateau or breakpoint response near the RCP. No differences were detected between the mean RCP and mean Deoxy-BP from either the locomotor or non-locomotor muscles; however, a high degree of individual variability was observed in the timing and order of occurrence of the specific breakpoints. These findings add insight into the relationships between ventilatory, locomotor, and non-locomotor muscle physiological breakpoints. While identifying a similar relationship between these breakpoints, individual variability was high; hence, caution is advised when using wearable NIRS to estimate RCP in an incremental ramp test.

AB  - Researchers are increasingly interested in leveraging the Internet of Things in medical and healthcare systems to provide better solutions such as remote health monitoring, personal fitness, and chronic disease management. A brain tumor is a potentially fatal cancer caused by the un-controllable growth of brain cells that affects human blood cells and nerves. However, accurate classification of brain tumors is difficult due to the vastly different anatomical structures of healthy and tumorous tissues. We propose a framework for brain tumor localization and classi-fication based on CenterNet. The proposed method uses the ResNet34 model with an attention block as a base network, which improves feature representation capacity by focusing on tumor locations and aids in tumor classification, particularly for a small tumor. Our method achieves 98.98% accuracy overall. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrated the efficacy of our approach for accurate detection and classification of the brain tumor than existing latest approaches.

AB  - Background: Greater adoption of wearable devices with multiple sensors may enhance personalized health monitoring, facilitate early detection of some diseases, and further scale up population health screening. However, few studies have explored the utility of data from wearable fitness trackers in cardiovascular and metabolic disease risk prediction.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associations between a range of activity metrics derived from a wearable consumer-grade fitness tracker and major modifiable biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease in a working-age population.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of 83 working adults. Participants wore Fitbit Charge 2 for 21 consecutive days and went through a health assessment, including fasting blood tests. The following clinical biomarkers were collected: BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, triglycerides (TGs), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood glucose. We used a range of wearable-derived metrics based on steps, heart rate (HR), and energy expenditure, including measures of stability of circadian activity rhythms, sedentary time, and time spent at various intensities of physical activity. Spearman rank correlation was used for preliminary analysis. Multiple linear regression adjusted for potential confounders was used to determine the extent to which each metric of activity was associated with continuous clinical biomarkers. In addition, pairwise multiple regression was used to investigate the significance and mutual dependence of activity metrics when two or more of them had significant association with the same outcome from the previous step of the analysis.
   Results: The participants were predominantly middle aged (mean age 44.3 years, SD 12), Chinese (62/83, 75%), and male (64/83, 77%). Blood biomarkers of cardiometabolic disease (HDL cholesterol and TGs) were significantly associated with steps-based activity metrics independent of age, gender, ethnicity, education, and shift work, whereas body composition biomarkers (BMI, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio) were significantly associated with energy expenditure-based and HR-based metrics when adjusted for the same confounders. Steps-based interdaily stability of circadian activity rhythm was strongly associated with HDL (beta=5.4 per 10% change; 95% CI 1.8 to 9.0; P=.005) and TG (beta=-27.7 per 10% change; 95% CI -48.4 to -7.0; P=.01). Average daily steps were negatively associated with TG (beta=-6.8 per 1000 steps; 95% CI -13.0 to -0.6; P=.04). The difference between average HR and resting HR was significantly associated with BMI (beta=-.5; 95% CI -1.0 to -0.1; P=.01) and waist circumference (beta=-1.3; 95% CI -2.4 to -0.2; P=.03).
   Conclusions: Wearable consumer-grade fitness trackers can provide acceptably accurate and meaningful information, which might be used in the risk prediction of cardiometabolic disease. Our results showed the beneficial effects of stable daily patterns of locomotor activity for cardiometabolic health. Study findings should be further replicated with larger population studies.

AB  - Perri, T, Reid, M, Murphy, A, Howle, K, and Duffield, R. Differentiating stroke and movement accelerometer profiles to improve prescription of tennis training drills. J Strength Cond Res 37(3): 646-651, 2023-This study compared the movement- and stroke-related accelerometer profiles and stroke counts between common on-court tennis training drills. Ten, junior-elite, male tennis players wore a cervical-mounted global positioning systems, with in-built accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer during hard court training sessions (n = 189). Individual training drills were classified into 8 categories based on previous research descriptions. Manufacturer software calculated total player load (tPL), while a prototype algorithm detected forehand (FH), backhands (BH), and serves and then calculated a stroke player load (sPL) from individual strokes. Movement player load (mPL) was calculated as the difference between tPL and sPL. Drill categories were compared for relative ((.)min(-1)) tPL, sPL, mPL, and stroke counts via a 1-way analysis of variance with effect sizes (Cohen's d) and 95% confidence intervals. Highest tPL(.)min(-1) existed in accuracy and recovery or defensive drills (p < 0.05), with lowest tPL center dot min(-1) values observed in match-play simulation (p < 0.05). For sPL center dot min(-1), accuracy drills elicited greater values compared with all other drill types (p < 0.05), partly via greater FH-sPL center dot min(-1) (p < 0.05), with lowest sPL center dot min(-1) existing for match-play (p < 0.05). Accuracy, open, and recovery or defensive drills result in greater BH-sPL center dot min(-1) and BH(.)min(-1) (p < 0.05). Serve-sPL center dot min(-1) is highest in technical and match-play drills (p < 0.05). Higher mPL center dot min(-1) existed in accuracy, recovery or defensive, 2v1 net, open, and 2v1 baseline (p < 0.05). Furthermore, mPL center dot min(-1) in points drills was greater than technical and match-play simulation drills (p < 0.05). Higher hitting-based accelerometer loads (sPL center dot min(-1)) exist in accuracy drills, whereas technical and match-play drills show the lowest movement demands (mPL center dot min(-1)). These findings can aid individual drill prescription for targeting movement or hitting load.

AB  - Developments in the internet of things technology (IoT) have greatly influenced the way we live and have been seen in a variety of application areas, including health care. Most of the papers reviewed dealt with some health care services, and there is little scientific literature on the application or implementation of IoT in cancer detection and treatment services. This encouraged us to (re) evaluate the provision of health-care services and their location to harness the benefits associated with the use of IoT. Also, the lateness which caused by transmitting data to the cloud and back to the application is inadmissible for healthcare systems which based on IoT. As well, it is not efficient to transmit so much data to the cloud for processing and storage, because it would saturate network bandwidth and not be scalable. This also encouraged us to use fog computing which take advantages of cloud resources and coordinate the utilization of geographically distributed edge devices. So, this paper proposes the implementation of healthcare system which based on IoT and fog computing technologies for averting the spread of cancer via early detection, evaluation of disease's symptoms, and also analyzing health data that gathered from IoT through various sensor networks and other smart devices to help healthcare professionals to turn a stream of data into actionable insights and evidence-based healthcare decision-making to improve and enhance cancer treatment.
   Due to the similarity of the general symptoms of cancer with some other diseases , we also proposed a neutrosophic multi-criteria decision making technique for assisting healthcare professionals to predict disease that patient may be suffers from if he/she does not have cancer. This technique depends on gathered data from proposed healthcare system and able to handle uncertainty of imprecision and ambiguity which resulted from the proportional priority scales of different symptoms of disease.

AB  - Traditional wearable devices are commonly nonrecyclable and nondegradable, resulting in energy waste and environmental pollution. Here, a household degradable and renewable ionic skin based on edible glutinous rice gel is developed for a strain, temperature and salivary enzyme activity sensor. This gel depends on intermolecular and intramolecular H-bonds among amylopectin and amylose, and this presents excellent skin-like properties, including stretchability, self-healing property, and adhesion to various substrates. The glutinous rice gel-based skin sensor can be used to monitor vital signs and physiological parameters such as body temperature and heart rate. The sensor also achieves specific speech recognition and detects temperature and body micromovements, which provides the potential to reconstruct language or sensory/motor functions. More importantly, because of the excellent biocompatibility and degradability, the sensor can directly detect the activity of human salivary amylase, which is useful for diagnosing pancreas-, kidney-, and spleen-related diseases in the elderly. Finally, the raw material of ionic skin that originates from traditional grains is degradable and renewable as well as it can be used to prepare household wearable devices. Hence, this work not only extends the application of wearable electronics in daily life but also facilitates health monitoring in the elderly and improves their quality of life.

AB  - Background: Some patients with COVID-19 experienced sudden death due to rapid symptom deterioration. Thus, it is important to predict COVID-19 symptom exacerbation at an early stage prior to increasing severity in patients. Patients with COVID-19 could experience a unique "silent hypoxia" at an early stage of the infection when they are apparently asymptomatic, but with rather low SpO(2) (oxygen saturation) levels. In order to continuously monitor SpO(2) in daily life, a high-performance wearable device, such as the Apple Watch or Fitbit, has become commercially available to monitor several biometric data including steps, resting heart rate (RHR), physical activity, sleep quality, and estimated oxygen variation (EOV).
   Objective: This study aimed to test whether EOV measured by the wearable device Fitbit can predict COVID-19 symptom exacerbation.
   Methods: We recruited patients with COVID-19 from August to November 2020. Patients were asked to wear the Fitbit for 30 days, and biometric data including EOV and RHR were extracted. EOV is a relative physiological measure that reflects users' SpO2 levels during sleep. We defined a high EOV signal as a patient's oxygen level exhibiting a significant dip and recovery within the index period, and a high RHR signal as daily RHR exceeding 5 beats per day compared with the minimum RHR of each patient in the study period. We defined successful prediction as the appearance of those signals within 2 days before the onset of the primary outcome. The primary outcome was the composite of deaths of all causes, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, use of mechanical ventilation, oxygenation, and exacerbation of COVID-19 symptoms, irrespective of readmission. We also assessed each outcome individually as secondary outcomes. We made weekly phone calls to discharged patients to check on their symptoms.
   Results: We enrolled 23 patients with COVID-19 diagnosed by a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. The patients had a mean age of 50.9 (SD 20) years, and 70% (n=16) were female. Each patient wore the Fitbit for 30 days. COVID-19 symptom exacerbation occurred in 6 (26%) patients. We were successful in predicting exacerbation using EOV signals in 4 out of 5 cases (sensitivity=80%, specificity=90%), whereas the sensitivity and specificity of high RHR signals were 50% and 80%, respectively, both lower than those of high EOV signals. Coincidental obstructive sleep apnea syndrome confirmed by polysomnography was detected in 1 patient via consistently high EOV signals.
   Conclusions: This pilot study successfully detected early COVID-19 symptom exacerbation by measuring EOV, which may help to identify the early signs of COVID-19 exacerbation.

AB  - Objective: At-home monitoring of respiration is of critical urgency especially in the era of the global pandemic due to COVID-19. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and seismocardiogram (SCG) signals-measured in less cumbersome contact form factors than the conventional sealed mask that measures respiratory air flow-are promising solutions for respiratory monitoring. In particular, respiratory rates (RR) can be estimated from ECG-derived respiratory (EDR) and SCG-derived respiratory (SDR) signals. Yet, non-respiratory artifacts might still be present in these surrogates of respiratory signals, hindering the accuracy of the RRs estimated. Methods: In this paper, we propose a novel U-Net-based cascaded framework to address this problem. The EDR and SDR signals were transformed to the spectro-temporal domain and subsequently denoised by a 2D U-Net to reduce the non-respiratory artifacts. Major Results: We have shown that the U-Net that fused an EDR input and an SDR input achieved a low mean absolute error of 0.82 breaths per minute (bpm) and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89 using data collected from our chest-worn wearable patch. We also qualitatively provided insights on the complementariness between EDR and SDR signals and demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed framework. Conclusion: ECG and SCG collected from a chest-worn wearable patch can complement each other and yield reliable RR estimation using the proposed cascaded framework. Significance: We anticipate that convenient and comfortable ECG and SCG measurement systems can be augmented with this framework to facilitate pervasive and accurate RR measurement.

AB  - Healthcare industry is the leading domain that has been revolutionized by the incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology resulting in smart medical applications. Conspicuously, this study presents an effective system of home-centric Urine-based Diabetes (UbD) monitoring system. Specifically, the proposed system comprises of 4-layers for predicting and monitoring diabetes-oriented urine infection. The system layers including Diabetic Data Acquisition (DDA) layer, Diabetic Data Classification (DDC) layer, Diabetic-Mining and Extraction (DME) layer, and Diabetic Prediction and Decision Making (DPDM) layer allow an individual not exclusively to track his/her diabetes measure on regular basis but the prediction procedure is also accomplished so that prudent steps can be taken at early stages. Additionally, probabilistic measurement of UbD monitoring in terms of Level of Diabetic Infection (LoDI), which is cumulatively quantified as Diabetes Infection Measure (DIM) has been performed for predictive purposes using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Moreover, the existence of UbD is visualized based on the Self-Organized Mapping (SOM) procedure. To validate the proposed system, numerous experimental simulations were performed on datasets of 4 individuals. Based on the experimental simulation, enhanced results in terms of temporal delay, classification efficiency, prediction efficiency, reliability and stability were registered for the proposed system in comparison to state-of-the-art decision-making techniques.

AB  - AimsCardiovascular dysautonomia may impact the quality of life and survival in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Such dysfunction is not systematically assessed in these patients. Wearable devices could help. The feasibility of a wearable biosensor to detect heart rate variability (HRV), a physiological marker of sympathovagal balance, was studied for the first time in real-world settings in ALS. MethodsFive ALS patients (two early/three late; one bulbar-onset; mildly-to-moderately disabled) and five age/sex/BMI/comorbidities-matched controls underwent assessment of 3-day HRV via VitalConnect biosensor (worn on the left thorax). De-identified data captured by the biosensor were transferred to a secure cloud server via a relay Bluetooth device. Baseline ALS severity/anxiety and physical activity during testing were documented/quantified. Time-domain HRV measures (i.e., pNN50) were analyzed. ResultsAn overall 3-day abnormal HRV (pNN50 < 3%), was found in three out of five patients (mean +/- SD for the group, 2.49 +/- 1.51). Similar changes were reported in controls (12.32 +/- 21.14%). There were no statistically significant relationships between pNN50 values and baseline anxiety or physical activity during the tested days (p > 0.05 for both groups). A negative correlation was found between pNN50 values and age in patients (p = 0.01) and controls (p = 0.09), which is similar with what is found in the general population. In line with prior studies, pNN50 values were independent of disease stage (p = 0.6) and disability (p = 0.4). ConclusionsThese preliminary results suggest that remote HRV measures using the VitalConnect is feasible and may constitute an improved strategy to provide insights into sympathovagal balance in ALS. Further work with larger sample sizes is warranted.

AB  - This paper presents the design, fabrication, and characterization results of a paper-based, low-cost, easy-to-use, comfortable and wearable tactile sensor array for human health monitoring applications. Paper substrate and spray-deposited metallic electrodes and traces are employed to achieve a low fabrication cost. Capacitive sensing scheme employing a deformable triangular PDMS sensing membrane is chosen due to its high sensitivity and zero DC power dissipation. Trade-offs among different sensor array designs are investigated to achieve an optimal design, which consists of a 1x5 sensor array occupying an area of 10 mm x 10 mm. Each sensor in the array achieves a nominal capacitance value and sensitivity of approximately 1 pF and 30 fF/mmHg, respectively. Fabricated sensor array can be comfortably attached to an individual's temporal region and ankle area to monitor real-time blood pressure (BP) pulse waveform with high fidelity, from which heart rate and heart rate variability information can be accurately obtained. In addition, the prototype sensor array demonstrates its capability of detecting atrial fibrillation (AFib) from BP pulse waveform measured from an AFib patient. [2020-0179]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide lockdown in response to COVID-19 pandemics has often led to physical inactivity and social distancing. When combined, these factors may affect quality and life and increase the risk of different diseases. Therefore, assessment of physical activity levels should be encouraged to monitor and identify those at a higher risk of inactivity. Smart technology is a promising tool to assess physical activity and health and may be particularly useful during a period of general lockdown.
   METHODS: An online survey was developed and shared among the Italian general population to collect data about physical activity and daily routine changes between January 2020 and the lockdown period from March 23 to March 29. Participants were asked to provide data such as daily step count (Steps) or heart rate (HR) measured and collected by their smart technology devices.
   RESULTS: Four hundred participants were included in the final analysis. During the lockdown, the number of steps dropped from 8284 +/- 4390 to 3294 +/- 3994 steps (P<0.001), while mean peak HR decreased from 61.3 +/- 18.2% to 55.9 +/- 17.3%(P<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide objective data about the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on physical activity, thus encouraging the use of smart devices to monitor and promote healthy lifestyles while faced with a confinement condition.

AB  - Using ECG signals captured by wearable devices for emotion recognition is a feasible solution. We propose a deep convolutional neural network incorporating attentional mechanisms for ECG emotion recognition. In order to address the problem of individuality differences in emotion recognition tasks, we incorporate an improved Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the proposed deep convolutional neural network. The deep convolutional neural network is responsible for capturing ECG features. Channel attention in CBAM is responsible for adding weight information to ECG features of different channels and spatial attention is responsible for the weighted representation of ECG features of different regions inside the channel. We used three publicly available datasets, WESAD, DREAMER, and ASCERTAIN, for the ECG emotion recognition task. The new state-of-the-art results are set in three datasets for multi-class classification results, WESAD for tri-class results, and ASCERTAIN for two-category results, respectively. A large number of experiments are performed, providing an interesting analysis of the design of the convolutional structure parameters and the role of the attention mechanism used. We propose to use large convolutional kernels to improve the effective perceptual field of the model and thus fully capture the ECG signal features, which achieves better performance compared to the commonly used small kernels. In addition, channel attention and spatial attention were added to the deep convolutional model separately to explore their contribution levels. We found that in most cases, channel attention contributed to the model at a higher level than spatial attention.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) and stroke are common in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM ). We aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of AF and stroke in patients with HCM during a 10-year period.
   Methods: Using the Korean National Health Insurance Services database, we identified patients diagnosed with HCM from the entire Korean population between 2005 and 2015. The annual prevalence and incidence of AF and stroke in HCM patients were estimated.
   Results: The prevalence of AF in HCM patients has gradually increased to 1.6-fold from 13.4% in 2005 to 20.9% in 2015. The incidence of AF ranged from 4.1 to 5.5%, a similar trend was observed for each year in HCM patients. The prevalence of stroke in HCM patients was approximately 10%, while that in HCM patients with AF was about 20%. During 8741 person-years, AF-related stroke occurred in 257 subjects among 2309 HCM patients with new-onset AF. The overall incidence rate of AF-associated stroke was 2.94 per 100 person-years. In subgroup analysis, the incidence rate of AF-associated stroke was 1.49 per 100 person-years in the under 45 year-old group and 1.48 per 100 person-years in the group with CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score of 0 or 1 point in HCM patients.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of AF in HCM patients gradually increased over 10 years. The annual risk of AF-associated stroke in HCM was over 1% even in younger patients and those with CHA(2)DS(2)VASc score of 0 or 1 point, which provide evidence to support the prevention of stroke in HCM patients with AF.

AB  - Heat stroke that may cause acute central nervous system dysfunction, multiple organ dysfunction and even death has become a typical health problem in tropical developing countries. The primary goal of heat stroke treatment is to lower core body temperature, which necessitates physical or medical cooling in time. Here, we design a new self-powered wearable brain-machine-interface system for real-time monitoring and regulating body temperature. This system can monitor body temperature in real time and transmit neural electrical stimulation signals into specific brain regions to lower the body temperature. The whole system can work without an external power supply and be powered by the body itself through the piezoelectric effect. The system comprises a temperature detecting unit, a power supply unit, a data processing module, and a brain stimulator. Demonstration of the system with stimulation electrodes implanted in the median preoptic nucleus brain region in mice reveals an evident decrease in body temperature (1.0 degrees C within 15 min). This self-powered strategy provides a new concept for future treatment of heat stroke and can extend the application of brain-machine-interface systems in medical care.

AB  - We describe a framework for lifelogging monitoring in the scope of dementia care, based on activity recognition from egocentric vision and semantic context-enrichment. As pure vision-based approaches appear to be already saturating in terms of recognition accuracy, we propose their enhancement with wearable bracelet accelerometer information. For that purpose, we design and study appropriate early and late fusion schemes to increase accuracy. The incorporation of mechanical variables, such as jerk, improves the recognition accuracy of activities that require fine motion. In addition, we describe a framework for semantic activity representation and interpretation, using Semantic Web technologies for building interoperable activity graphs. The system is personalized, as deployment-specific activity models are authored, while problems related to the disease are detected by rules. Complemented by lifelogging applications, the system is able to support interventions by clinicians, and endorse a feeling of safety and inclusion for end-users and their carers.

AB  - Prediabetes affects one in three people and has a 10% annual conversion rate to type 2 diabetes without lifestyle or medical interventions. Management of glycemic health is essential to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes. However, there is currently no commercially-available and noninvasive method for monitoring glycemic health to aid in self-management of prediabetes. There is a critical need for innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring and management of glycemic health. In this study, using a dataset of 25,000 simultaneous interstitial glucose and noninvasive wearable smartwatch measurements, we demonstrated the feasibility of using noninvasive and widely accessible methods, including smartwatches and food logs recorded over 10 days, to continuously detect personalized glucose deviations and to predict the exact interstitial glucose value in real time with up to 84% and 87% accuracy, respectively. We also establish methods for designing variables using data-driven and domain-driven methods from noninvasive wearables toward interstitial glucose prediction.

AB  - Objective: The objectives of this study were to design and develop an open-circuit electromagnetic resonant skin patch sensor, characterize the fluid volume and resonant frequency relationship, and investigate the sensor's ability to measure limb hemodynamics and pulse volume waveform features. Methods: The skin patch was designed from an open-circuit electromagnetic resonant sensor comprised of a single baseline trace of copper configured into a square planar spiral which had a self-resonating response when excited by an external radio frequency sweep. Using a human arm phantom with a realistic vascular network, the sensor's performance to measure limb hemodynamics was evaluated. Results: The sensor was able to measure pulsatile blood flow which registered as shifts in the sensor's resonant frequencies. The time-varying waveform pattern of the resonant frequency displayed a systolic upstroke, a systolic peak, a dicrotic notch, and a diastolic down stroke. The resonant frequency waveform features and peak systolic time were validated against ultrasound pulse wave Doppler. A statistical correlation analysis revealed a strong correlation (R-2 = 0.99) between the resonant sensor peak systolic time and the pulse wave Doppler peak systolic time. Conclusion: The sensor was able to detect pulsatile flow, identify hemodynamic waveform features, and measure heart rate with 98% accuracy. Significance: The open-circuit resonant sensor design leverages the architecture of a thin planar spiral which is passive (does not require batteries), robust and lightweight (does not have electrical components or electrical connections), and may be able to wirelessly monitor cardiovascular health and limb hemodynamics.

AB  - Sepsis is a severe organ dysfunction typically caused by wound infection which leads to septic shock, organ failure or even death if no early diagnosis and property medical treatment were taken. Herein, we report a soft, wearable and battery-free wound dressing system (WDS) for wireless and real-time monitoring of wound condition and sepsis-related biomarker (procalcitonin [PCT]) in wound exudate for early sepsis detection. The battery-free WDS powered by near-field communication enables wireless data transmission, signal processing and power supply, which allows portable intelligent wound caring. The exudate collection associates with soft silicone based microfluidic technologies (exudate collection time within 15 s), that can filtrate contamination at the cell level and enable a superior filtration rate up to 95% with adopting microsphere structures. The battery-free WDS also includes state-of-the-art biosensors, which can accurate detect the pH value, wound temperature, and PCT level and thus for sepsis diagnosis. In vivo studies of SD rats prove the capability of the WDS for continuously monitoring wound condition and PCT concentration in the exudate. As a result, the reported fully integrated WDS provides a potential solution for further developing wearable, multifunctional and on-site disease diagnosis.

AB  - We propose a co-simulation framework comprising biomechanical human body models and wearable inertial sensor models to analyse gait events dynamically, depending on inertial sensor type, sensor positioning, and processing algorithms. A total of 960 inertial sensors were virtually attached to the lower extremities of a validated biomechanical model and shoe model. Walking of hemiparetic patients was simulated using motion capture data (kinematic simulation). Accelerations and angular velocities were synthesised according to the inertial sensor models. A comprehensive error analysis of detected gait events versus reference gait events of each simulated sensor position across all segments was performed. For gait event detection, we considered 1-, 2-, and 4-phase gait models. Results of hemiparetic patients showed superior gait event estimation performance for a sensor fusion of angular velocity and acceleration data with lower nMAEs (9%) across all sensor positions compared to error estimation with acceleration data only. Depending on algorithm choice and parameterisation, gait event detection performance increased up to 65%. Our results suggest that user personalisation of IMU placement should be pursued as a first priority for gait phase detection, while sensor position variation may be a secondary adaptation target. When comparing rotatory and translatory error components per body segment, larger interquartile ranges of rotatory errors were observed for all phase models i.e., repositioning the sensor around the body segment axis was more harmful than along the limb axis for gait phase detection. The proposed co-simulation framework is suitable for evaluating different sensor modalities, as well as gait event detection algorithms for different gait phase models. The results of our analysis open a new path for utilising biomechanical human digital twins in wearable system design and performance estimation before physical device prototypes are deployed.

AB  - Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSNs) are devices that can be ported with different detection, storage, computer, but also communication capabilities. Interfacing was beneficial whenever information was collected by many sources, which may lead to erroneous sensory information. During this paper, an information nuclear fission Ensembles technique for working raw healthcare information through WBSNs during ambient cloud computer settings as described. Monitoring data were collected through various instruments and combined to provide statistics on high movements. The simulation was conducted using the low-cost Internet of Things (IoT) surveillance system on chronic kidney disease (CKD). Biosensors have been used in healthcare surveillance systems to record health problems. Patients with CKD would benefit from the developed surveillance system, which will facilitate the early diagnosis of the predominant diseases. This merged information was then sent into using the Aggregation algorithm can forecast premature cardiac illness and CKD. These groups were housed within a Cloud processing context; therefore these forecasting calculations were distributed. Another lengthy practical investigation backs that system provides application, while those findings were encouraging, with 98 percent efficiency whenever the height of that tree was equivalent with 15, total amount if estimation methods are 40, while the overall predicting job was based upon 8 attributes. We compute a mean square ECG waveform from all available leads and use a new technique to measure the QT interval. We tested this algorithm using standard and unique ECG databases. Our real-time QT interval measurement algorithm was found to be stable, accurate, and capable of tracking changing QT values.

AB  - For patients who have a senile mental disorder such as dementia, the quantity of exercise and amount of sunlight are an important clue for doses and treatment. Therefore, monitoring daily health information is necessary for patients' safety and health. A portable and wearable sensor device and server configuration for monitoring data are needed to provide these services for patients. A watch-type device (smart watch) that patients wear and a server system are developed in this paper. The smart watch developed includes a GPS, accelerometer, and illumination sensor, and can obtain real time health information by measuring the position of patients, quantity of exercise, and amount of sunlight. The server system includes the sensor data analysis algorithm and web server used by the doctor and protector to monitor the sensor data acquired from the smart watch. The proposed data analysis algorithm acquires the exercise information and detects the step count in patients' motion acquired from the acceleration sensor and verifies the three cases of fast pace, slow pace, and walking pace, showing 96% of the experimental results. If developed and the u-Healthcare System for dementia patients is applied, higher quality medical services can be provided to patients.

AB  - Stroke is one of the most prevalent health issues that people face today, causing long-term complications such as paresis, hemiparesis, and aphasia. These conditions significantly impact a patient's physical abilities and cause financial and social hardships. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents a groundbreaking solution-a wearable rehabilitation glove. This motorized glove is designed to provide comfortable and effective rehabilitation for patients with paresis. Its unique soft materials and compact size make it easy to use in clinical settings and at home. The glove can train each finger individually and all fingers together, using assistive force generated by advanced linear integrated actuators controlled by sEMG signals. The glove is also durable and long-lasting, with 4-5 h of battery life. The wearable motorized glove is worn on the affected hand to provide assistive force during rehabilitation training. The key to this glove's effectiveness is its ability to perform the classified hand gestures acquired from the non-affected hand by integrating four sEMG sensors and a deep learning algorithm (the 1D-CNN algorithm and the InceptionTime algorithm). The InceptionTime algorithm classified ten hand gestures' sEMG signals with an accuracy of 91.60% and 90.09% in the training and verification sets, respectively. The overall accuracy was 90.89%. It showed potential as a tool for developing effective hand gesture recognition systems. The classified hand gestures can be used as a control command for the motorized wearable glove placed on the affected hand, allowing it to mimic the movements of the non-affected hand. This innovative technology performs rehabilitation exercises based on the theory of mirror therapy and task-oriented therapy. Overall, this wearable rehabilitation glove represents a significant step forward in stroke rehabilitation, offering a practical and effective solution to help patients recover from stroke's physical, financial, and social impact.

AB  - Patients after stroke with paretic or plegic hands require frequent exercises to promote neuroplasticity and to improve hand joint mobilization. Available devices for hand exercising are intended for persons with some level of hand control or provide continuous passive motion with limited patient involvement. Patients can benefit from self-exercising where they use the other hand to exercise the plegic or paretic one. However, post-stroke neuropsychological complications, apathy, and cognitive impairments such as forgetfulness make regular self-exercising difficult. This paper describes Przypominajka v2-a system intended to support self-exercising, remind about it, and motivate patients. We propose a glove-based device with an on-device machine-learning-based exercise scoring, a tablet-based interface, and a web-based application for therapists. The feasibility of on-device inference and the accuracy of correct exercise classification was evaluated on four healthy participants. Whole system use was described in a case study with a patient with a paretic hand. The anomaly classification has an accuracy of 91.3% and f(1) value of 91.6% but achieves poorer results for new users (78% and 81%). The case study showed that patients had a positive reaction to exercising with Przypominajka, but there were issues relating to sensor glove: ease of putting on and clarity of instructions. The paper presents a new way in which sensor systems can support the rehabilitation of after-stroke patients with an on-device machine-learning-based classification that can accurately score and contribute to patient motivation.

AB  - Wearable sensors have seen remarkable recent technological developments, and their role in healthcare is expected to expand. Specifically, monitoring tissue circulation in patients who have undergone reconstructive surgery is critical because blood flow deficiencies must be rescued within hours or the transplant will fail due to thrombosis/haematoma within the artery or vein. We design a wearable, wireless, continuous, multipoint sensor to monitor tissue circulation. The system measures pulse waves, skin colour, and tissue temperature to reproduce physician assessment. Data are analysed in real time for patient risk using an algorithm. This multicentre clinical trial involved 73 patients who underwent transplant surgery and had their tissue circulation monitored until postoperative day 7. Herein, we show that the overall agreement rate between physician and sensor findings is 99.2%. In addition, the patient questionnaire results indicate that the device is easy to wear. The sensor demonstrates non-invasive, real-time, continuous, multi-point, wireless, and reliable monitoring for postoperative care. This wearable system can improve the success rate of reconstructive surgeries.

AB  - Objective. The recent breakthrough of wearable sleep monitoring devices has resulted in large amounts of sleep data. However, as limited labels are available, interpreting these data requires automated sleep stage classification methods with a small need for labeled training data. Transfer learning and domain adaptation offer possible solutions by enabling models to learn on a source dataset and adapt to a target dataset. Approach. In this paper, we investigate adversarial domain adaptation applied to real use cases with wearable sleep datasets acquired from diseased patient populations. Different practical aspects of the adversarial domain adaptation framework are examined, including the added value of (pseudo-)labels from the target dataset and the influence of domain mismatch between the source and target data. The method is also implemented for personalization to specific patients. Main results. The results show that adversarial domain adaptation is effective in the application of sleep staging on wearable data. When compared to a model applied on a target dataset without any adaptation, the domain adaptation method in its simplest form achieves relative gains of 7%-27% in accuracy. The performance in the target domain is further boosted by adding pseudo-labels and real target domain labels when available, and by choosing an appropriate source dataset. Furthermore, unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation can also personalize a model, improving the performance by 1%-2% compared to a non-personalized model. Significance. In conclusion, adversarial domain adaptation provides a flexible framework for semi-supervised and unsupervised transfer learning. This is particularly useful in sleep staging and other wearable electroencephalography applications. (Clinical trial registration number: S64190.)

AB  - Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the major cause of stroke since approximately 25% of all strokes are of cardioembolic-origin. The detection and diagnosis of AF are often challenging due to the asymptomatic and intermittent nature of AF.
   Hypothesis A wearable electrocardiogram (ECG)-device could increase the likelihood of AF detection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a novel, consumer-grade, single-lead ECG recording device (Necklace-ECG) for screening, identifying and diagnosing of AF both by a cardiologist and automated AF-detection algorithms.
   Methods A thirty-second ECG was recorded with the Necklace-ECG device from two positions; between the palms (palm) and between the palm and the chest (chest). Simultaneously registered 3-lead ECGs (Holter) served as a golden standard for the final rhythm diagnosis. Two cardiologists interpreted independently in a blinded fashion the Necklace-ECG recordings from 145 patients (66 AF and 79 sinus rhythm, SR). In addition, the Necklace-ECG recordings were analyzed with an automatic AF detection algorithm.
   Results Two cardiologists diagnosed the correct rhythm of the interpretable Necklace-ECG with a mean sensitivity of 97.2% and 99.1% (palm and chest, respectively) and specificity of 100% and 98.5%. The automatic arrhythmia algorithm detected the correct rhythm with a sensitivity of 94.7% and 98.3% (palm and chest) and specificity of 100% of the interpretable measurements.
   Conclusions The novel Necklace-ECG device is able to detect AF with high sensitivity and specificity as evaluated both by cardiologists and an automated AF-detection algorithm. Thus, the wearable Necklace-ECG is a new, promising method for AF screening. Clinical trial registration: Study was registered in the ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT03753139).

AB  - Separation of heart and lung sounds from the observated mixtures has become a hot research topic in the prevention and diagnosis of heart and lung diseases. Especially, in real clinical situations, clinicians can perform auscultation by using the bioacoustics knowledge of sounds to diagnose the diseases of heart and lung. Therefore, to have an intimate knowledge of the current health status of patients, it is of great significance to develop intelligent auscultation methods to improve the effectiveness of hearing and assist clinicians in practice. In this paper, a novel blind source separation (BSS) method is proposed based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and auxiliary function technique for the separation of heart sound mixtures and lung sound mixtures in the reverberation environment. In the algorithm, a denoising pre-processing technique is firstly used to the noise reduction such that eliminating the influence of the additive white Gaussian noise. Moreover, the principal component analysis method is applied to reduce the dimension so that the number of source signals is equal to the number of sensors. Then, NMF is introduced as the source model to capture the spectral structure of each source. Afterwards, an auxiliary function is built as the cost function, the demixing matrix and the NMF model parameters are updated by building the fast and stable update rules. Finally, the separated source scales are restored to obtain the reconstructed sources. Experimental results according to the BSS performance of heart sound mixtures and lung sound mixtures demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the conventional BSS methods, especially for the highly reverberant environment.

AB  - Background: Assistive technology, in the form of a smart home environment, is employed to support people with dementia.
   Objectives: To propose a system for continuous and objective remote monitoring of problematic daily living activity areas and design personalized interventions based on system feedback and clinical observations for improving cognitive function and health-related quality of life.
   Methods: The assistive technology of the proposed system, including wearable, sleep, object motion, presence, and utility usage sensors, was methodically deployed at four different home installations of people with cognitive impairment. Detection of sleep patterns, physical activity, and activities of daily living, based on the collected sensor data and analytics, was available at all times through comprehensive data visualization solutions. Combined with clinical observation, targeted psychosocial interventions were introduced to enhance the participants' quality of life and improve their cognitive functions and daily functionality. Meanwhile, participants and their caregivers were able to visualize a reduced set of information tailored to their needs.
   Results: Overall, paired-sample t-test analysis of monitored qualities revealed improvement for all participants in neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, improvement was detected from the beginning to the end of the trial, in physical condition and in the domains of sleep. Detecting abnormalities via the system, for example in sleep quality, such as REM sleep, has proved to be critical to assess current status, drive interventions, and evaluate improvements in a reliable manner.
   Conclusion: It has been proved that the proposed system is suitable to support clinicians to reliably drive and evaluate clinical interventions toward quality of life improvement of people with cognitive impairment.

AB  - Patients with diabetes and previous history of ulceration occupy the highest category of risk for reulceration and amputation. Annual recurrence rates of diabetic ulcerations have been reported as high as 34%, 61%, and 70% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively, with studies reporting 20% to 58% recurrence rate within 1 year. As the ever growing epidemic of diabetes expands globally, this sequelae of diabetic complication will continue to require increasing resources from the healthcare community to effectively manage. Recent data suggest that removal of preventative podiatric care from statewide reimbursement systems lead to significant and sustained increases in hospital admission (37%), charges (38%), length of stay (23%), and severe aggregate outcomes including amputation, sepsis and death (49%). The addition of comorbidities such as peripheral artery disease, poor nutrition, and non-adherence to preventive therapies not only increase a patient's likelihood for ulcer recurrence, but also cost of care and certainty of hospital admission. Currently, numerous efforts, guidelines, and industry generated products exist to prolong remission from ulceration; however, the clinical science for treating this patient population calls for much more effort. Despite this, data continue to suggest to demonstrate that appropriate follow-up care, shoe and insole modification, and patient education play a central role in reducing reulceration and amputation. Novel modalities for offloading and wearable sensor technologies offer the advantage of round-the-clock, patient specific and active response healthcare. These have the potential to detect, or even prevent, many wounds before they begin.

LA  - English
AB  - Due to the complexity of medical images, traditional medical image classification methods have been unable to meet the actual application needs. In recent years, the rapid development of deep learning theory has provided a technical approach for solving medical image classification. However, deep learning has the following problems in the application of medical image classification. First, it is impossible to construct a deep learning model with excellent performance according to the characteristics of medical images. Second, the current deep learning network structure and training strategies are less adaptable to medical images. Therefore, this paper first introduces the visual attention mechanism into the deep learning model so that the information can be extracted more effectively according to the problem of medical images, and the reasoning is realized at a finer granularity. It can increase the interpretability of the model. Additionally, to solve the problem of matching the deep learning network structure and training strategy to medical images, this paper will construct a novel multiscale convolutional neural network model that can automatically extract high-level discriminative appearance features from the original image, and the loss function uses the Mahalanobis distance optimization model to obtain a better training strategy, which can improve the robust performance of the network model. The medical image classification task is completed by the above method. Based on the above ideas, this paper proposes a medical classification algorithm based on a visual attention mechanism-multiscale convolutional neural network. The lung nodules and breast cancer images were classified by the method in this paper. The experimental results show that the accuracy of medical image classification in this paper is not only higher than that of traditional machine learning methods but also improved compared with other deep learning methods, and the method has good stability and robustness.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is essential in stroke rehabilitation of hemiparetic patients to avoid health risks, and moderate to vigorous PA could promote patients' recovery. However, PA assessments are limited to clinical environments. Little is known about PA in unguided free-living. Wearable sensors could reveal patients' PA during rehabilitation, and day-long long-term measurements over several weeks might reveal recovery trends of affected and less-affected body sides.
   Methods: We investigated PA in an observation study during outpatient rehabilitation in a day-care center. PA of affected and less-affected body sides, including upper and lower limbs were derived using wearable motion sensors. In this analysis we focused on PA during free-living and clinician guided therapies, and investigated differences between body-sides. Linear regressions were used to estimate metabolic equivalents for each limb at comparable scale. Non-parametric statistics were derived to quantify PA differences between body sides.
   Results: We analyzed 102 full-day movement data recordings from eleven hemiparetic patients during individual rehabilitation periods up to 79 days. The comparison between free-living and clinician guided therapy showed on average 16.1% higher PA in the affected arm during therapy and 5.3% higher PA in the affected leg during therapy. Average differences between free-living and therapy in the less-affected side were below 4.5%.
   Conclusion: We analyzed PA of patients with a hemiparesis in two distinct rehabilitation settings, including free-living and clinician guided therapies over several weeks and compared MET values of affected and less-affected body sides. In particular, we investigated PA using individual regression models for each limb. We demonstrated that wearable motion sensors provide insights in patient's PA during rehabilitation. Although, no clear PA trends were found, our analysis showed patients' tendency to sedentary behavior, confirming previous lab study results. Our PA analysis approach could be used beyond clinical rehabilitation to devise personalized patient and limb-specific exercise recommendations in future remote rehabilitation.

AB  - BackgroundIndividuals who have been diagnosed with melanoma have more than a 9-fold increased risk of developing another melanoma. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure following a melanoma diagnosis can be modified to reduce risk of a new melanoma diagnosis. Yet research shows that many melanoma survivors do not report optimal sun protection practices. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a UVR-sensor wearable device to improve sun protection behaviors and reduce sunburns in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in melanoma survivors.MethodsWe will conduct an RCT among 368 melanoma survivors in two waves (Summer 2020, Summer 2021). This approach allows for adequate recruitment of the required sample and potential improvements to recruitment, compliance, and retention strategies between waves. The intervention includes an informational brochure about sun protection behaviors and a commercially available UVR-sensor wearable device (Shade), which accurately measures UVR. The device, along with its associated mobile application, measures and stores UVR exposure. As UVR exposure accumulates, the device provides notifications to increase sun protection action. Survivors in the control group receive the device and a separate mobile application that does not provide notifications or summary UVR exposure data. Participants will be asked to wear the device for 12weeks. They will complete surveys about their sun behaviors at study entry, every 4weeks during the intervention, and 1 year later. At the end of the intervention period, intervention and control groups will be compared for differences in a summary measure of sun protection habits and experience of a sunburn. We will also measure self-reported physical activity, depression, and anxiety to examine potential unintended negative consequences of the intervention.DiscussionThe study intervention will be completed Fall 2021, with anticipated results available in 2022. If this intervention improves sun protection behaviors in melanoma survivors, these findings would support expanding the use of this technology with other populations at high risk for melanoma.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT03927742.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the feasibility of using accelerometers to monitor physical activity in persons with stroke admitted to inpatient rehabilitation.
   Design: Longitudinal observational study.
   Participants: Persons with stroke admitted to a specialized rehabilitation centre for sub-acute rehabilitation were recruited between August and December 2016.
   Methods: Volume and intensity of physical activity were assessed with accelerometers throughout the rehabilitation period. Indicators of feasibility included processes (recruitment, protocol adherence and participants' experiences) and scientific feasibility, which assessed the accelerometers' ability to detect change in physical activity among stroke survivors who ambulate independently and those who are dependent on a mobility device.
   Results: Twenty-seven out of 31 eligible individuals took part in this study, with 23 (85%) completing it. In total, 432 days of rehabilitation were monitored and valid physical activity data were obtained for 408 days (94%). There were no indications that the measurement interfered with participants' ability to participate in rehabilitation. Despite the subjects' ambulation status, the number of steps and time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity increased significantly across the first 18 days of rehabilitation, whereas sedentary time was unchanged.
   Conclusion: This study supports the feasibility of using accelerometers to capture physical activity behaviour in survivors of stroke during inpatient rehabilitation.

AB  - The development of automatic monitoring and diagnosis systems for cardiac patients over the internet has been facilitated by recent advancements in wearable sensor devices from electrocardiographs (ECGs), which need the use of patient-specific approaches. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common chronic cardiovascular disease that can cause conditions that are potentially fatal. Therefore, for the diagnosis of likely heart failure, precise PVC detection from ECGs is crucial. In the clinical settings, cardiologists typically employ long-term ECGs as a tool to identify PVCs, where a cardiologist must put in a lot of time and effort to appropriately assess the long-term ECGs which is time consuming and cumbersome. By addressing these issues, we have investigated a deep learning method with a pre-trained deep residual network, ResNet-18, to identify PVCs automatically using transfer learning mechanism. Herein, features are extracted by the inner layers of the network automatically compared to hand-crafted feature extraction methods. Transfer learning mechanism handles the difficulties of required large volume of training data for a deep model. The pre-trained model is evaluated on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) Arrhythmia and Institute of Cardiological Technics (INCART) datasets. First, we used the Pan-Tompkins algorithm to segment 44,103 normal and 6423 PVC beats, as well as 106,239 normal and 9987 PVC beats from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and IN-CART datasets, respectively. The pre-trained model employed the segmented beats as input after being converted into 2D (two-dimensional) images. The method is optimized with the using of weighted random samples, on-the-fly augmentation, Adam optimizer, and call back feature. The results from the proposed method demonstrate the satisfactory findings without the using of any complex pre-processing and feature extraction technique as well as design complexity of model. Using LOSOCV (leave one subject out cross-validation), the received accuracies on MIT-BIH and INCART are 99.93% and 99.77%, respectively, suppressing the state-of-the-art methods for PVC recognition on unseen data. This demonstrates the efficacy and generalizability of the proposed method on the imbalanced datasets. Due to the absence of device-specific (patient-specific) information at the evaluating stage on the target datasets in this study, the method might be used as a general approach to handle the situations in which ECG signals are obtained from different patients utilizing a variety of smart sensor devices.

AB  - Energy expenditure (EE) estimation is an important factor in tracking personal activity and preventing chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Accurate and real-time EE estimation utilizing small wearable sensors is a difficult task, primarily because the most existing schemes work offline or use heuristics. In this paper, we focus on accurate EE estimation for tracking ambulatory activities (walking, standing, climbing upstairs, or downstairs) of a typical smartphone user. We used built-in smartphone sensors (accelerometer and barometer sensor), sampled at low frequency, to accurately estimate EE. Using a barometer sensor, in addition to an accelerometer sensor, greatly increases the accuracy of EE estimation. Using bagged regression trees, a machine learning technique, we developed a generic regression model for EE estimation that yields upto 96% correlation with actual EE. We compare our results against the state-of-the-art calorimetry equations and consumer electronics devices (Fitbit and Nike+ FuelBand). The newly developed EE estimation algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy compared with currently available methods. The results were calibrated against COSMED K4b2 calorimeter readings.

AB  - Regular monitoring of common physiological signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, can be an effective way to either prevent or detect many kinds of chronic conditions. In particular, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a worldwide concern. According to the World Health Organization, 32% of all deaths worldwide are from CVDs. In addition, stress-related illnesses cost $190 billion in healthcare costs per year. Currently, contact devices are required to extract most of an individual's physiological information, which can be uncomfortable for users and can cause discomfort. However, in recent years, remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology is gaining interest, which enables contactless monitoring of the blood volume pulse signal using a regular camera, and ultimately can provide the same physiological information as a contact device. In this paper, we propose a benchmark comparison using a new multimodal database consisting of 56 subjects where each subject was submitted to three different tasks. Each subject wore a wearable device capable of extracting photoplethysmography signals and was filmed to allow simultaneous rPPG signal extraction. Several experiments were conducted, including a comparison between information from contact and remote signals and stress state recognition. Results have shown that in this dataset, rPPG signals were capable of dealing with motion artifacts better than contact PPG sensors and overall had better quality if compared to the signals from the contact sensor. Moreover, the statistical analysis of the variance method had shown that at least two heart-rate variability (HRV) features, NNi 20 and SAMPEN, were capable of differentiating between stress and non-stress states. In addition, three features, inter-beat interval (IBI), NNi 20, and SAMPEN, were capable of differentiating between tasks relating to different levels of difficulty. Furthermore, using machine learning to classify a "stressed" or "unstressed" state, the models were able to achieve an accuracy score of 83.11%.

AB  - We introduce a set of input models for fusing information from ensembles of wearable sensors supporting human performance and telemedicine. Veracity is demonstrated in action classification related to sport, specifically strikes in boxing and taekwondo. Four input models, formulated to be compatible with a broad range of classifiers, are introduced and two diverse classifiers, dynamic time warping (DTW) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are implemented in conjunction with the input models. Seven classification models fusing information at the input-level, output-level, and a combination of both are formulated. Action classification for 18 boxing punches and 24 taekwondo kicks demonstrate our fusion classifiers outperform the best DTW and CNN uni-axial classifiers. Furthermore, although DTW is ostensibly an ideal choice for human movements experiencing non-linear variations, our results demonstrate deep learning fusion classifiers outperform DTW. This is a novel finding given that CNNs are normally designed for multi-dimensional data and do not specifically compensate for non-linear variations within signal classes. The generalized formulation enables subject-specific movement classification in a feature-blind fashion with trivial computational expense for trained CNNs. A commercial boxing system, 'Corner', has been produced for real-world mass-market use based on this investigation providing a basis for future telemedicine translation.

AB  - Breathing biomarkers, such as breathing rate, fractional inspiratory time, and inhalation-exhalation ratio, are vital for monitoring the user's health and well-being. Accurate estimation of such biomarkers requires breathing phase detection, i.e., inhalation and exhalation. However, traditional breathing phase monitoring relies on uncomfortable equipment, e.g., chestbands. Smartphone acoustic sensors have shown promising results for passive breathing monitoring during sleep or guided breathing. However, detecting breathing phases using acoustic data can be challenging for various reasons. One of the major obstacles is the complexity of annotating breathing sounds due to inaudible parts in regular breathing and background noises. This paper assesses the potential of using smartphone acoustic sensors for passive unguided breathing phase monitoring in a natural environment. We address the annotation challenges by developing a novel variant of the teacher-student training method for transferring knowledge from an inertial sensor to an acoustic sensor, eliminating the need for manual breathing sound annotation by fusing signal processing with deep learning techniques. We train and evaluate our model on the breathing data collected from 131 subjects, including healthy individuals and respiratory patients. Experimental results show that our model can detect breathing phases with 77.33% accuracy using acoustic sensors. We further present an example use-case of breathing phase-detection by first estimating the biomarkers from the estimated breathing phases and then using these biomarkers for pulmonary patient detection. Using the detected breathing phases, we can estimate fractional inspiratory time with 92.08% accuracy, the inhalation-exhalation ratio with 86.76% accuracy, and the breathing rate with 91.74% accuracy. Moreover, we can distinguish respiratory patients from healthy individuals with up to 76% accuracy. This paper is the first to show the feasibility of detecting regular breathing phases towards passively monitoring respiratory health and well-being using acoustic data captured by a smartphone.

AB  - Background Rugby league is a high-intensity collision sport that carries a risk of concussion. Youth athletes are considered to be more vulnerable and take longer to recover from concussion than adult athletes. Purpose To review head impact events in elite-level junior representative rugby league and to verify and describe characteristics of X-patch(TM)-recorded impacts via video analysis. Study Design Observational case series. Methods The X-patch(TM) was used on twenty-one adolescent players (thirteen forwards and eight backs) during a 2017 junior representative rugby league competition. Game-day footage, recorded by a trained videographer from a single camera, was synchronised with X-patch(TM)-recorded timestamped events. Impacts were double verified by video review. Impact rates, playing characteristics, and gameplay situations were described. Results The X-patch(TM)-recorded 624 impacts >= 20g between game start and finish, of which 564 (90.4%) were verified on video. Upon video review, 413 (73.2%) of all verified impacts >= 20g where determined to be direct head impacts. Direct head impacts >= 20g occurred at a rate of 5.2 impacts per game hour; 7.6 for forwards and 3.0 for backs (range = 0-18.2). A defender's arm directly impacting the head of the ball carrier was the most common event, accounting for 21.3% (n = 120) of all impacts, and 46.7% of all "hit-up" impacts. There were no medically diagnosed concussions during the competition. Conclusion The majority (90.4%) of head impacts >= 20g recorded by the X-patch(TM) sensor were verified by video. Double verification of direct head impacts in addition to cross-verification of sensor-recorded impacts using a secondary source such as synchronised video review can be used to ensure accuracy and validation of data.

AB  - Accurate estimation of daily total energy expenditure (EE) is a prerequisite for assisted weight management and assessing certain health conditions. The use of wearable sensors for predicting free-living EE is challenged by consistent sensor placement, user compliance, and estimation methods used. This paper examines whether a single ear-worn accelerometer can be used for EE estimation under free-living conditions. An EE prediction model was first derived and validated in a controlled setting using healthy subjects involving different physical activities. Ten different activities were assessed showing a tenfold cross validation error of 0.24. Furthermore, the EE prediction model shows a mean absolute deviation below 1.2 metabolic equivalent of tasks. The same model was applied to a free-living setting with a different population for further validation. The results were compared against those derived from doubly labeled water. In free-living settings, the predicted daily EE has a correlation of 0.74, p = 0.008, and a MAD of 27 kcal/day. These results demonstrate that laboratory-derived prediction models can be used to predict EE under free-living conditions.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm broadens to several research fields. Thus, Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has been adopted as a standard to create an IoT scheme implemented on healthcare system. Furthermore, IoT can be employed to measure several diseases including stroke, diabetes, as well as respiratory diseases to monitor patient condition and environment change that might be harmful for patients. Implementation and realization of IoT for monitoring respiratory diseases is needed since in Taiwan the risk to get more severe symptoms by those diseases is relatively high considering the air pollution that is getting higher. In this study, IoT system is built based on the integration of several independent applications. In addition, our scheme consists of four main components such as environment sensing box, patient monitoring tools, android apps, and web Graphical User Interface (GUI). Web GUI is useful for health practitioners such as doctors and nurses to monitor the condition of patients obtained by patient monitoring tools. Moreover, patients and doctors can assess the status of weather and environmental condition whether it is safe or harmful for patients. Finally, android based apps is necessary for patients to connect all of schemes as well as monitoring all conditions including health and environmental status. The assessment of our tools indicates that the implemented scheme is consistent enough shown by low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE) achieved by our IoT system.

AB  - The Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is a rapid, inexpensive, and popular screening tool for cognitive functions. In spite of its qualitative capabilities in diagnosis of neurological diseases, the assessment of the CDT has depended on quantitative methods as well as manual paper based methods. Furthermore, due to the impact of the advancement of mobile smart devices imbedding several sensors and deep learning algorithms, the necessity of a standardized, qualitative, and automatic scoring system for CDT has been increased. This study presents a mobile phone application, mCDT, for the CDT and suggests a novel, automatic and qualitative scoring method using mobile sensor data and deep learning algorithms: CNN, a convolutional network, U-Net, a convolutional network for biomedical image segmentation, and the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database. To obtain DeepC, a trained model for segmenting a contour image from a hand drawn clock image, U-Net was trained with 159 CDT hand-drawn images at 128 x 128 resolution, obtained via mCDT. To construct DeepH, a trained model for segmenting the hands in a clock image, U-Net was trained with the same 159 CDT 128 x 128 resolution images. For obtaining DeepN, a trained model for classifying the digit images from a hand drawn clock image, CNN was trained with the MNIST database. Using DeepC, DeepH and DeepN with the sensor data, parameters of contour (0-3 points), numbers (0-4 points), hands (0-5 points), and the center (0-1 points) were scored for a total of 13 points. From 219 subjects, performance testing was completed with images and sensor data obtained via mCDT. For an objective performance analysis, all the images were scored and crosschecked by two clinical experts in CDT scaling. Performance test analysis derived a sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision for the contour parameter of 89.33, 92.68, 89.95 and 98.15%, for the hands parameter of 80.21, 95.93, 89.04 and 93.90%, for the numbers parameter of 83.87, 95.31, 87.21 and 97.74%, and for the center parameter of 98.42, 86.21, 96.80 and 97.91%, respectively. From these results, the mCDT application and its scoring system provide utility in differentiating dementia disease subtypes, being valuable in clinical practice and for studies in the field.

AB  - One of the many services that intelligent systems can provide is the ability to analyze the impact of different medical conditions on daily behavior. In this study, we use smart home and wearable sensors to collect data, while (n = 84) older adults perform complex activities of daily living. We analyze the data using machine learning techniques and reveal that differences between healthy older adults and adults with Parkinson disease not only exist in their activity patterns, but that these differences can be automatically recognized. Our machine learning classifiers reach an accuracy of 0.97 with an area under the ROC curve value of 0.97 in distinguishing these groups. Our permutation-based testing confirms that the sensor-based differences between these groups are statistically significant.

AB  - Introduction Diabetes prevalence continues to grow and there remains a significant diagnostic gap in one-third of the US population that has pre-diabetes. Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics.
   Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models.
   Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%).
   Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study.

KW  - STROKE REHABILITATION
AB  - Objective. This study aims to extract motor ingredients through data mining from wearable sensors in a virtual reality goal-directed shoulder rehabilitation (GDSR) system and to examine their effects toward clinical assessment. Design. A single-group before/after comparison. Setting. Outpatient research hospital. Subjects. 16 patients with frozen shoulder. Interventions. The rehabilitation treatment involved GDSR exercises, hot pack, and interferential therapy. All patients first received hot pack and interferential therapy on the shoulder joints before engaging in the exercises. The GDSR exercise sessions were 40 minutes twice a week for 4 weeks. Main Measures. Clinical assessments included Constant and Murley score, range of motion of the shoulder, and muscle strength of upper arm as main measures. Motor indices from sensor data and task performance were measured as secondary measures. Results. The pre- and posttest results for task performance, motor indices, and the clinical assessments indicated significant improvement for the majority of the assessed items. Correlation analysis between the task performance and clinical assessments revealed significant correlations among a number of items. Stepwise regression analysis showed that task performance effectively predicted the results of several clinical assessment items. Conclusions. The motor ingredients derived from the wearable sensor and task performance are applicable and adequate to examine and predict clinical improvement after GDSR training.

AB  - Rett syndrome, a rare genetic neurodevelopmental disorder in humans, does not have an effective cure. However, multiple therapies and medications exist to treat symptoms and improve patients' quality of life. As research continues to discover and evaluate new medications for Rett syndrome patients, there remains a lack of objective physiological and motor activity-based (physio-motor) biomarkers that enable the measurement of the effect of these medications on the change in patients' Rett syndrome severity. In our work, using a commercially available wearable chest patch, we recorded simultaneous electrocardiogram and three-axis acceleration from 20 patients suffering from Rett syndrome along with the corresponding Clinical Global Impression-Severity score, which measures the overall disease severity on a 7-point Likert scale. We derived physio-motor features from these recordings that captured heart rate variability, activity metrics, and the interactions between heart rate and activity. Further, we developed machine learning (ML) models to classify high-severity Rett patients from low-severity Rett patients using the derived physio-motor features. For the best-trained model, we obtained a pooled area under the receiver operating curve equal to 0.92 via a leave-one-out-patient cross-validation approach. Finally, we computed the feature popularity scores for all the trained ML models and identified physio-motor biomarkers for Rett syndrome.

AB  - In recent years, due to increased attention of individual physical health condition, the demand on portable multi-vital signs monitoring devices has shown an explosive growth. This work designed a portable, multi-vital signs monitoring system, consisting of chest unit and wrist unit, with size of 32 mm x 32 mm and diameter of 30 mm, respectively. The designed system is capable of transmitting measured electrocardiograph (ECG), pulse wave and body temperature signal to the mobile devices wirelessly by Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technique. The heart rate, pulse oximetry (SpO(2)) and respiratory rate are extracted through time domain algorithm. The chest and wrist units can continuously monitor body vital signs for more than 12 and 24 hours, respectively. Besides, the experiment results reveal that the chest unit is able to monitor patients with heart rate abnormalities such as atrial fibrillation and premature beats. The typical heart diseases can be detected in real-time. Meanwhile, the wrist unit clearly detects the changes of the physical parameters of the subjects under different physiological conditions. The accuracy of the designed system is consistent with that of the commercial medical instrument counterpart, with further advantages of compact, portable and patient-friendly natures.

AB  - Purpose: Radiation dermatitis (RD) is a common, unpleasant side effect of patients receiving radiation therapy. In clinical practice, the severity of RD is graded manually through visual inspection, which is labor intensive and often leads to large inter rater variations. To overcome these shortcomings, this study aimed to develop an automatic RD assessment based on deep learning (DL) techniques that could efficiently assist the RD severity classification in clinical application.
   Methods and Materials: A total of 1205 photographs of the head and neck region were collected from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) undergoing radiation therapy. The severity of RD in these photographs was graded by 5 qualified assessors based on the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group guidance. An end-to-end RD grading framework was developed by combining a DL-based segmentation network and a DL-based RD severity classifier, which are used for segmenting the neck region from the camera-captured photographs and grading, respectively. U-Net was used for segmentation and another convolutional neural network classifier (DenseNet-121) was applied to RD severity classification. Dice similarity coefficient was used to evaluate the performance of segmentation. Severity classification was evaluated by several metrics, including overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   Results: Results of segmentation showed that the averaged dice similarity coefficients were 91.2% and 90.8% for front and side view, respectively. For RD severity classification, the overall accuracy of test photographs was 83.0%. Our method accurately classified 90.5% of grade 0, 67.2% of grade 1, 93.8% of grade 2, and 100% of above grade 2 cases. The overall prediction performance was comparable with human assessors. There was no significant difference in accuracy when using manually or automatically segmented regions (P = .683).
   Conclusions: We have successfully demonstrated a DL-based method for automatic assessment of RD severity in patients with NPC. This method holds great potential for efficient and effective assessing and monitoring of RD in patients with NPC. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Physical activity can confer diverse benefits on cancer survivors. Unfortunately, many cancer survivors are not sufficiently active. The efficacy of physical activity interventions for this population may be increased by grounding them in Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Combining game design elements with wearable technologies may be a useful and scalable approach to targeting SDT constructs to promote cancer survivors' physical activity.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Steps2Health, a physical activity intervention for cancer survivors. It also aims to investigate the effects of the intervention on motivation, physical activity, and step count.
   Methods: We randomized 78 insufficiently active cancer survivors to an experimental or comparison group. All participants received a physical activity tracker. The experimental group participants also received a set sequence of multimedia messaging service messages that were triggered in real time by meeting predetermined cumulative step count totals. Messages presented information about a virtual journey and included photographs and vivid descriptions of locations to increase autonomous motivation. Additional messages targeted perceptions of relatedness (eg, role modeling) and competence (eg, facilitating mastery experiences). We administered preand postintervention surveys and conducted 15 individual interviews to evaluate the intervention. We performed directed content analysis of qualitative data and conducted mixed effects linear modeling to investigate participants' changes in motivation, self-reported physical activity, and device-measured step counts.
   Results: There was minimal loss to follow-up (3/78, 4%), the device wear rate was high (2548/3044, 83.71% of days), and technical problems with messaging based on real-time step counts were limited. Our qualitative data analysis revealed 3 overarching themes: accessibility, autonomous motivation, and relatedness. Participants successfully navigated the technological aspects and game design elements of the intervention. Participants found messages targeting autonomous motivation and competence or self-efficacy to be enjoyable and compelling, but one feasibility criterion for participant engagement (response rate to text messages) was not met. Messages targeting relatedness were less highly rated than the messages targeting autonomous motivation and competence or self-efficacy. During the intervention, both groups increased their motivation for physical activity (B=0.16; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.30; P=.04; d=0.49), and assignment to the experimental group was associated with increased self-reported leisure activity score (B=10.78; 95% CI 3.54 to 18.02; P=.005; d=0.64). The experimental group had greater increases in daily step counts over time (B=322.08; 95% CI 54.01 to 590.15; P=.02; d=0.28).
   Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility of using real-time game design elements to target SDT constructs and increase cancer survivors' physical activity. Overall, our findings support the acceptability of the Steps2Health intervention, but fostering active participant engagement and targeting relatedness may present additional challenges. Steps2Health may help cancer survivors increase their physical activity levels.

Nevertheless, these electrodes are inappropriate in wearable long-term applications mainly due to the use of conductive gels and inflexibility. Various types of dry electrodes are proposed in the literature to address the inherent disadvantages of wet electrodes. Yet few works in the state-ofthe-art address mechanical reliability tests which is of paramount importance in real world wearable applications.
   In this manuscript, we have demonstrated a relatively inexpensive flexible and stretchable dry electrode to record the EEG. The electrode is formed in a 3D shape with 4 legs in order to increase the compliance to the skin as well as mechanical and electrical reliability. The electrical performance of the electrode is found to be similar to the standard wet Ag/AgCl counterpart. In addition to the typical tensile strength test, the mechanical endurance of the electrode is verified using a custom-designed stroke test in a relatively severe condition.

AB  - The human eye contains multiple biomarkers related to various diseases, making electronic contact lens an ideal non-invasive platform for their diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in technology have enabled the monitoring and diagnosis of glaucoma from Intraocular Pressure (IOP) detection, diabetes from glucose concentration detections, and other biosensors for pH and temperature sensing. Different sensor designs have led to distinct power transfer techniques, among which inductively coupled power transfer is considered most favourable for electronic contact lenses power delivery applications. Therefore, loop antenna, spiral shape antenna, and antenna with nanomaterials such as graphene and hybrid silver nanofibers have been explored under Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) frequency bands for both Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) and data communication. Notably, spiral antennas are also considered as the component of IOP sensing using capacitive sensors to detect the changes in frequency caused by pressure. This article reviews the state-of-the-art technologies in electronic contact lens sensors and their power delivery techniques. Herein, diverse sensing methods, materials, and power transfer techniques and the promising future trends and challenges in electronic contact lenses have been presented.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of smoking in the United States general population has gradually declined to the lowest rate ever recorded; however, this has not been true for persons with HIV.
   Objective: We conducted a pilot test to assess the feasibility and efficacy of the Lumme Quit Smoking mobile app and smartwatch combination with sensing capabilities to improve smoking cessation in persons with HIV.
   Methods: A total of 40 participants were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned 1:1 to the control arm, which received an 8-week supply of nicotine replacement therapy, a 30-minute smoking cessation counseling session, and weekly check-in calls with study staff, or to the intervention arm, which additionally received the Lumme Quit Smoking app and smartwatch.
   Results: Of the 40 participants enrolled, 37 completed the follow-up study assessments and 16 used the app every day during the 56-day period. During the 6-month recruitment and enrollment period, 122 people were screened for eligibility, with 67.2% (82/122) deemed ineligible. Smoking criteria and incompatible tech were the major reasons for ineligibility. There was no difference in the proportion of 7-day point prevalence abstinence by study arm and no significant decrease in exhaled carbon monoxide for the intervention and control arms separately. However, the average exhaled carbon monoxide decreased over time when analyzing both arms together (P=.02).
   Conclusions: Results suggest excellent feasibility and acceptability of using a smoking sensor app among this smoking population. The knowledge gained from this research will enable the scientific community, clinicians, and community stakeholders to improve tobacco cessation outcomes for persons with HIV.

AB  - Background: Noninvasive outpatient monitoring for heart failure (HF) has significant opportunity to reduce patient morbidity and the costs associated with recurrent hospitalization. The purpose of this study was to validate the ability of radiofrequency (RF) to assess lung fluid via a wearable patch device compared to thoracic CT in order to characterize volume overload.
   Methods: 120 subjects were studied: 66 acute heart failure (AHF) inpatients and 54 subjects without AHF (Control - 44 healthy and 10 stable HF). All underwent supine thoracic CT scans and supine RF readings from the wearable patch device placed on the left mid-axillary line (age = 74 +/- 16 vs. 57 +/- 15 yrs.; female = 38 vs. 44%; BMI = 33.2 +/- 9.0 vs. 27.3 +/- 5.1, AHF vs. Control respectively). Reflected RF signals and subject-specific anthropometric data were used to calculate the RF-determined lung fluid content. CT Lung fluid was reported as percentage of lung volume. Classification analyses were used to compare RF and CT performance.
   Results: AHF presented with higher lung fluid than controls by both CT and RF (CT: 20.1 +/- 4.2% vs. 15.4 +/- 2.4%; RF: 20.7 +/- 5.6% vs. 15.6 +/- 3.3%; p < 0.05 for all). The correlation between lung fluid measured by CT vs. RF was r = 0.7 (p < 0.001). RF determined lung fluid performed as well as CT in distinguishing AHF from control subjects: Sensitivity: 70% vs. 86%; Specificity: 82% vs. 83%; Positive Predictive Value: 82% vs. 86%; Negative Predictive Value: 69% vs. 83%, CT vs. RF respectively.
   Conclusions: Noninvasive nonionizing RF determined lung fluid provides a potential alternative to other measures for diagnosing and monitoring pulmonary fluid overload. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antennas for the microwave imaging system are large which results in higher radiation, manufacturing cost, poor radiation characteristics and it will be difficult to locate on breast tissues.
   OBJECTIVE: We propose a wearable ultra-wide band antenna for use in the diagnosis of breast cancer bio-medical applications.
   METHODS: The antenna has been fabricated on 1.6 mm FR4 substrate with a dimension of 28 x 14.4 mm(2) and can operate between 2 GHz-12 GHz with S-11 < -10 dB with best radiation characteristics. The prototype of the proposed antenna was fabricated and practically tested and the results were found to be consistent with the simulated results. The proposed UWB antenna is intended to radiate and receive information covering the entire spectrum from 3 GHz to 13 GHz. For good impendence matching throughout the larger spectrum, the defected ground structure (diamond shape) was exploited. All the dimensions of the proposed design are confirmed by parametric study and optimization.
   RESULTS: The maximum simulated efficiency was ranging from 80 to 84% in the desired operating frequency. The maximum Specific Absorption Rate of the proposed antenna was 0.98 W/Kg. Therefore, the proposed UWB antenna could be the right structure for breast cancer diagnosis in terms of SAR. The antenna was found to have a substantial radiation efficiency of around 78%-84% in the desired operating bandwidth. The overall realized gain of the proposed UWB antenna was seen ranging from 1.8-4.2 dB which is sufficient for bio-medical applications.
   CONCLUSION: The breast phantom was modeled for the validation of the performance of the antenna and SAR was analyzed. The value of SAR of the designed antenna was observed at about 0.98 W/Kg, which is suitable for medical applications.

AB  - The workplace influences the safety, health, and productivity of workers at multiple levels. To protect and promote total worker health, smart hardware, and software tools have emerged for the identification, elimination, substitution, and control of occupational hazards. Wearable devices enable constant monitoring of individual workers and the environment, whereas connected worker solutions provide contextual information and decision support. Here, the recent trends in commercial workplace technologies to monitor and manage occupational risks, injuries, accidents, and diseases are reviewed. Workplace safety wearables for safe lifting, ergonomics, hazard identification, sleep monitoring, fatigue management, and heat and cold stress are discussed. Examples of workplace productivity wearables for asset tracking, augmented reality, gesture and motion control, brain wave sensing, and work stress management are given. Workplace health wearables designed for work-related musculoskeletal disorders, functional movement disorders, respiratory hazards, cardiovascular health, outdoor sun exposure, and continuous glucose monitoring are shown. Connected worker platforms are discussed with information about the architecture, system modules, intelligent operations, and industry applications. Predictive analytics provide contextual information about occupational safety risks, resource allocation, equipment failure, and predictive maintenance. Altogether, these examples highlight the ground-level benefits of real-time visibility about frontline workers, work environment, distributed assets, workforce efficiency, and safety compliance.

AB  - Background Detection of disease by means of volatile organic compounds from breath samples using sensors is an attractive approach to fast, noninvasive and inexpensive diagnostics. However, these techniques are still limited to applications within the laboratory settings. Here, we report on the development and use of a fast, portable, and IoT-connected point-of-care device (so-called, SniffPhone) to detect and classify gastric cancer to potentially provide new qualitative solutions for cancer screening.
   Methods A validation study of patients with gastric cancer, patients with high-risk precancerous gastric lesions, and controls was conducted with 2 SniffPhone devices. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used as a classifying model of the sensing signals obatined from the examined groups. For the testing step, an additional device was added. The study group included 274 patients: 94 with gastric cancer, 67 who were in the high-risk group, and 113 controls.
   Results The results of the test set showed a clear discrimination between patients with gastric cancer and controls using the 2-device LDA model (area under the curve, 93.8%; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 87.5%; overall accuracy, 91.1%), and acceptable results were also achieved for patients with high-risk lesions (the corresponding values for dysplasia were 84.9%, 45.2%, 87.5%, and 65.9%, respectively). The test-phase analysis showed lower accuracies, though still clinically useful.
   Conclusion Our results demonstrate that a portable breath sensor device could be useful in point-of-care settings. It shows a promise for detection of gastric cancer as well as for other types of disease.
   Lay Summary
   A portable sensor-based breath analyzer for detection of gastric cancer can be used in point-of-care settings.
   The results are transferrable between devices via advanced IoT technology.
   Both the hardware and software of the reported breath analyzer could be easily modified to enable detection and monitirng of other disease states.

AB  - Given the current prevalence and impact of cervical cancer worldwide, many technological developments focused on automating the screening process have arisen recently. Nonetheless, there is still a clear need for affordable, portable and automated IoT-based solutions to expand the coverage of current cervical screening programs worldwide. This is particularly relevant for lower-resource countries, which account for 88% of all cervical cancer-related deaths. This work proposes a low-cost, smartphone-based microscopy device for the analysis of liquid-based cytology samples, through autonomous image acquisition and automated identification of cervical lesions. Different deep learning models for object detection were separately optimised and compared to select the most adequate network architecture. Transfer learning from a similar application domain - conventional cytology - was also investigated as a way of improving the robustness of the analysis pipeline, as well as overcoming the limitations of the mobile-acquired image dataset specifically collected and manually annotated by specialists under the scope of this work. In this process, a detection performance benchmark in the SIPAKMED dataset - test mean average precision (mAP) of 0.37798 and average recall (AR) of 0.63651 - was reported for the first time. Although further improvements are required for its integration in a computer-aided diagnosis system sufficiently reliable for deployment in a clinical context, the explored approach exhibits promising results (cross-validation mAP of 0.20315, AR of 0.46572 and analysis time of 4 minutes per cytological sample), corresponding to a step forward in the development of a cost-effective mobile IoT framework that supports cervical lesion screening.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is usually considered the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, the accurate identification of MCI individuals with high risk in converting to AD is essential for the potential prevention and treatment of AD. Recently, the great success of deep learning has sparked interest in applying deep learning to neuroimaging field. However, deep learning techniques are prone to overfitting since available neuroimaging datasets are not sufficiently large. Therefore, we proposed a deep learning model fusing cortical features to address the issue of fusion and classification blocks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we compared seven different models on the same dataset in the literature. The results show that our proposed model outperformed the competing models in the prediction of MCI conversion with an accuracy of 83.3% in the testing dataset. Subsequently, we used deep learning to characterize the contribution of brain regions and different cortical features to MCI progression. The results revealed that the caudal anterior cingulate and pars orbitalis contributed most to the classification task, and our model pays more attention to volume features and cortical thickness features.

AB  - Pediatric patients with cancer are at high risk for severe infections. Changes in vital signs, triggered by infections, may be detected earlier by continuous recording with a wearable device than with discrete measurements. This prospective, observational single-center feasibility study consecutively recruited pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. The WD Everion (R) was used for 14 days in each of the 20 patients on study to continuously record vital signs. Nine different vital signs and health indicators derived from them, plus six quality scores. This resulted in 274 study days (6576 hours) with 85'854 measuring points, which are a total of 772'686 measurements of vital signs and health indicators, plus 515'124 quality scores. Additionally, non-WD data like side effects, acceptability of the WD and effort for investigators were collected. In this manuscript, we present the methods of acquisition and explanations to the complete data set, which have been made publically available on open access and which can be used to study feasibility of continuous multi-parameter recording of vital signs by a WD.

AB  - Background:Stroke is one of the most common neurologic injuries worldwide. Over decades, evidence-based neurorehabilitation research and advancements in wireless, wearable sensor design have supported the deployment of technologies to facilitate recovery after stroke. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is one such technology, however, clinical application remains limited. To understand this translational practice gap and improve clinical uptake, it is essential to include stakeholder voices in an analysis of neurorehabilitation practice, the acceptability of current sEMG technologies, and facilitators and barriers to sEMG use in the clinic and the community. The purpose of this study was to foreground the perspectives of stroke survivors to gain a better understanding of their experiences in neurorehabilitation, the technologies they have used during their recovery, and their opinions of lab-designed and commercially-available sEMG systems. Methods:A qualitative, phenomenological study was completed. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight stroke survivors (age range 49-78 years, 6 months to 12 years post-stroke) and two caregivers from a large metropolitan region. A demonstration of four sEMG systems was provided to gather perceptions of sensor design, features and function, and user interface. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded for analysis using constant comparison until data saturation was reached. Results:Three themes emerged from the data: (1) "Surface EMG has potential horizontal ellipsis .but horizontal ellipsis " highlights the recognition of sEMG as a valuable tool but reveals a lack of understanding and need for clear meaning from the data; (2) "Tracking incremental progress over days or years is important" highlights the persistence of hope and potential benefit of sEMG in detecting small changes that may inform neurorehabilitation practice and policy; and (3) "Neurorehabilitation technology is cumbersome" highlights the tension between optimizing therapy time and trying new technologies, managing cost, logistics and set-up, and desired technology features. Conclusion:Further translation of sEMG technology for neurorehabilitation holds promise for stroke survivors, but sEMG system design and user interface needs refinement. The process of using sEMG technology and products must be simple and provide meaningful insight to recovery. Including stroke survivors directly in translational efforts is essential to improve uptake in clinical environments.

AB  - Sick children need a continuous monitoring, but this involves high costs for the government and for the parents. The use of information and communication technologies (ICT) jointly with artificial intelligence and smart devices can reduce these costs, help the children and assist their parents. This paper presents a smart architecture for children's chronic illness monitoring that will let the caregivers (parents, teachers and doctors) to remotely monitor the health of the children based on the sensors embedded in the smartphones and smart wearable devices. The proposed architecture includes a smart algorithm developed to intelligently detect if a parameter has exceeded a threshold, thus it may imply an emergency or not. To check the correct operation of this system, we have developed a small wearable device that is able to measure the heart rate and the body temperature. We have designed a secure mechanism to stablish a Bluetooth connection with the smartphone. In addition, the system is able to perform the data fusion in both the information packetizing process, which contributes to improve the protocol performance, and in the measured values combination, where it is used a stochastic approach. As a result, our system can fusion data from different sensors in real-time and detect automatically strange situations for sending a warning to the caregivers. Finally, the consumed bandwidth and battery autonomy of the developed device have been measured. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Research suggests optimizing sleep, exercise and work-life balance may improve resident physician burnout. Wearable biosensors may allow residents to detect and correct poor sleep and exercise habits before burnout develops. Our objectives were to evaluate the feasibility of a wearable biosensor to characterize exercise/sleep in neurology residents and examine its relationship to self-reported, validated survey measures. We also assessed the device's impact on well-being and barriers to use. Methods This prospective cohort study evaluated the WHOOP Strap 2.0 in neurology residents. Participants completed regular online surveys, including self-reported hours of sleep/exercise, and validated sleep/exercise scales at 3-month intervals. Autonomic, exercise, and sleep measures were obtained from WHOOP. Changes were evaluated over time via linear regression. Survey and WHOOP metrics were compared using Pearson correlations. Results Sixteen (72.7%) of 22 eligible participants enrolled. Eleven (68.8%) met the minimum usage requirement (6+ months) and were classified as 'consecutive wearers.' Significant increases were found in sleep duration and exercise intensity. Moderate-to-low correlations were found between survey responses and WHOOP measures. Most (73%) participants reported a positive impact on well-being. Barriers to use included 'Forgetting to wear' (20%) and 'not motivational' (23.3%). Conclusion Wearable biosensors may be a feasible tool to evaluate sleep/exercise in residents.

AB  - ECG signals contain a lot of information related to cardiac activity and play a critical role in diagnosing of heart disease. However, relying on health information monitoring with simple ECG measurement can lead to errors in health information analysis. Therefore, for accurate diagnosis and analysis, an algorithm that can efficiently process user's measurement environment and activity information is required. In this paper, we propose a wearable ECG monitoring system based on Knowledge Discovery Computing using 3-axis acceleration sensor. The proposed system measures real-time cardiac information and activity information simultaneously to minimize errors in health information analysis through Knowledge Discovery Computing between the user's environment information and abnormal ECG according to the measurement environment in everyday life. In addition, we implemented a packet transmission protocol to effectively transmit large amounts of data analyzed through Knowledge Discovery Computing to the base station. First, arrhythmia detection was performed using R-peak detection preprocessing and pattern matching algorithm. Also, a classification algorithm was implemented to classify activity types by utilizing an accelerometer in order to recognize the context surrounding the user. Information on the user's vital signs and activity information can be used for more accurately determine arrhythmia in daily life. Also, variable packet generation protocol was designed for an effective transmission of data packets increased exponentially by long-term measurements and wireless data transfer. The variable packet generation protocol is efficient in limited wireless network environments, because it generate packets of the entire data only with case of abnormal cardiac rhythm and transmits minimal information for normal cardiac rhythm. In order to evaluate the performance of ECG monitoring system based on Knowledge Discovery Computing, we designed a 2-lead ECG measurement belt manufactured with conductive fiber to minimize user discomfort, and assessed the system performance in data packet transmission, data recovery, and arrhythmia detection in dynamic states in daily life. In static states, the posture detection was 100%, heart rate detection 99.8%, and CR (Compression Ratio) was 193.99 and correlation coefficient of 0.95 with commercial systems. In dynamic states, 96% detection rate and 59.14 of CR is identified. If arrhythmia is determined based only on ECG signals, it is difficult to differentiate an actual abnormal cardiac rhythm from an ECG signal altered due to motion. The experiments conducted in this study confirmed that Knowledge Discovery is possible in the dynamic state through the proposed system in daily life.

AB  - BackgroundLifestyle factors such as physical fitness, dietary habits, mental stress, and sleep quality, are strong predictors of the occurrence, clinical course, and overall treatment outcomes of common cardiovascular diseases. However, these lifestyle factors are rarely monitored, nor used in daily clinical practice and personalized cardiac care. Moreover, non-adherence to long-term self-reporting of these lifestyle factors is common. In the present study, we evaluate adherence to a continuous unobtrusive and patient-friendly lifestyle monitoring system using evidence-based assessment tools.MethodsIn a prospective observational trial (N = 100), the project investigates usability of and adherence to a monitoring system for multiple lifestyle factors relevant to cardiovascular disease, i.e., daily physical activity levels, dietary habits, mental stress, smoking, and sleep quality. Patients with coronary artery disease, valvular disease and arrhythmias undergoing an elective intervention are asked to participate. The monitoring system consists of a secured online platform with a custom-built conversational interface-a chatbot-and a wrist-worn wearable medical device. The wrist-worn device collects continuous objective data on physical activity and the chatbot is used to collect self-report data. Participants collect self-reported lifestyle data via the chatbot for a maximum of 4 days every other week; in the same week physiological data are collected for 7 days for 24 h. Data collection starts one week before the intervention and continues until 1-year after discharge. Via a dashboard, patients can observe their lifestyle measures and adherence to self-reporting, set and track personal goals, and share their lifestyle data with practitioners and relatives. The primary outcome of the trial is adherence to using the integrated platform for self-tracking data. The secondary outcomes include system usability, determinants of adherence and the relation between baseline lifestyle behaviour and long-term patient-relevant outcomes.DiscussionSystematic monitoring during daily life is essential to gain insights into patients' lifestyle behaviour. In this context, adherence to monitoring systems is critical for cardiologists and other care providers to monitor recovery after a cardiac intervention and to detect clinical deterioration. With this project, we will evaluate patients' adherence to lifestyle monitoring technology. This work contributes to the understanding of patient-centered data collection and interpretation, to enable personalized care after cardiac interventions in order to ultimately improve patient-relevant outcomes and reduce health care costs.

AB  - Advanced technologies such as internet of things (IoT) and clouds have significantly influenced on modern medical monitoring systems. Analytical statistics derived from massive patients' medical data via different data analysis methods, contribute in remote medical monitoring, early diagnosis of diseases, predicting clinical events, and recommending vital health/medical instructions. According to existence of the same health/medical services in functional aspect, finding appropriate composite health/medical services by the patients has been remained as a major concern in modern medical systems. Regarding this challenge, in this paper, a medical monitoring scheme for cloud-based IoT platform is proposed, in which the patients' medical conditions are derived through predicting diseases by mining her physiological data collected from IoT devices and other medical records. A disease diagnosis model is used to analyze the patients' medical data for the aim of offering a composite health/medical prescription. After confirming the outcomes by medical team, it is sent to the patient. Then, the patient indicates her nonfunctional requirements such as location, cost and time to find the most appropriate composite health/medical service based on her preferences. Experimental results reveal that the proposed scheme is successful in achieving effective diseases diagnosis for offering composite health/medical prescriptions.

AB  - In the daily management of type 1 diabetes (T1D), determining the correct insulin dose to be injected at meal-time is fundamental to achieve optimal glycemic control. Wearable sensors, such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, are instrumental to achieve this purpose. In this paper, we show how CGM data, together with commonly recorded inputs (carbohydrate intake and bolus insulin), can be used to develop an algorithm that allows classifying, at meal-time, the post-prandial glycemic status (i.e., blood glucose concentration being too low, too high, or within target range). Such an outcome can then be used to improve the efficacy of insulin therapy by reducing or increasing the corresponding meal bolus dose. A state-of-the-art T1D simulation environment, including intraday variability and a behavioral model, was used to generate a rich in silico dataset corresponding to 100 subjects over a two-month scenario. Then, an extreme gradient-boosted tree (XGB) algorithm was employed to classify the post-prandial glycemic status. Finally, we demonstrate how the XGB algorithm outcome can be exploited to improve glycemic control in T1D through real-time adjustment of the meal insulin bolus. The proposed XGB algorithm obtained good accuracy at classifying post-prandial glycemic status (AUROC = 0.84 [0.78, 0.87]). Consequently, when used to adjust, in real-time, meal insulin boluses obtained with a bolus calculator, the proposed approach improves glycemic control when compared to the baseline bolus calculator. In particular, percentage time in target [70, 180] mg/dL was improved from 61.98 (+/- 13.89) to 67.00 (+/- 11.54; p < 0.01) without increasing hypoglycemia.

AB  - Strokes are one of the leading causes of death in the world. Despite the high mortality rate, chances of recovery are high when an accurate diagnosis is made quickly, and appropriate treatment is provided. Several types of neuroimaging techniques are used to detect strokes, and computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging are the main ones. Although magnetic resonance imaging shows clearer results, CT is, in most cases, the most viable alternative, due to the reduced examination time and low cost. Several computeraided diagnostic systems have been developed in recent years with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems, which establish rapid communication between the IoT devices, provide greater integration between specialists and patients, and consequently, a better medical follow up. However, stroke detection and classification techniques in IoT devices require that these methods developed methods have low computational and low storage costs. Thus, Edge computing devices have been attracting attention for their excellent processing capabilities, providing a layer between the IoT device and the cloud. This work proposes a new feature extractor for brain CT images based on an Adaptive Analysis of Brain Tissue Densities. The proposed method presented promising results of accuracy and F1-score, reaching 98.13% and 97.83%, respectively, surpassing several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the proposed method presents low computational cost, with an average extraction time of 0.087s per image, and is, thus, a viable option for integration in IoT and Edge Computing devices, by providing rapid detection and classification of strokes.

AB  - Background More than 80% of adolescent and young adult cancer patients (AYACPs) experienced psychological distress. Physical activity and behavioral activation are effective to relieve the psychological distress in AYACPs. Methods Participants aged 15-39 years diagnosed with malignant tumors were included. A total of 143 eligible AYACPs were randomly assigned to three groups. The treatment-as-usual group (N = 48) received routine care, the physical activity group (N = 47) received 8 weeks of physical activity program based on intelligent wearable devices, and the behavioral activation group (N = 48) received an internet-based modified behavioral activation program for 8 weeks. Objective outcome measures included salivary cortisol and testosterone. Results Linear mixed-model analyses showed significant differences between treatment-as-usual, physical activity and behavioral activation in salivary cortisol, as well as total scores on depression and anxiety, physical activity, self-efficacy, and social support. Significantly stronger effect sizes for physical activity group compared with behavioral activation group were found on physical activity (d = 0.53) (1 week after intervention), moderate activity (d = 0.61), and walking activity (d = 0.57) (3-month follow-up). Conclusions Intelligent, wearable, device-based physical activity program is more effective in alleviating anxiety and depression, reducing saliva cortisol, and improving physical activity in AYACPs than internet-based modified behavioral activation program. Intelligent, wearable, device-based physical activity program can reduce the time cost of AYACPs to ensure that the intervention is carried out.

AB  - With the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, hand tremor detection has become a popular research topic because it helps with the diagnosis and tracking of disease progression. Conventional hand tremor detection algorithms involved wearable sensors. A non-invasive hand tremor detection algorithm using videos as input is desirable but the existing video-based algorithms are sensitive to environmental conditions. An algorithm, with the capability of detecting hand tremor from videos with a cluttered background, would allow the videos recorded in a non-research environment to be used. Clinicians and researchers could use videos collected from patients and participants in their own home environment or standard clinical settings. Neural network based machine learning architectures provide high accuracy classification results in related fields including hand gesture recognition and body movement detection systems. We thus investigated the accuracy of advanced neural network architectures to automatically detect hand tremor in videos with a cluttered background. We examined configurations with different sets of features and neural network based classification models. We compared the performance of different combinations of features and classification models and then selected the combination which provided the highest accuracy of hand tremor detection. We used cross validation to test the accuracy of the trained model predictions. The highest classification accuracy for automatically detecting tremor (vs non tremor) was 80.6% and this was obtained using Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory and features based on measures of frequency and amplitude change.

AB  - In this era of electronic health, healthcare data is very important because it contains information about human survival. In addition, the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution has redefined modern healthcare systems and management by providing continuous monitoring. In this case, the data related to the heart is more important and requires proper analysis. For the analysis of heart data, Electrocardiogram (ECG) is used. In this work, machine learning techniques, such as adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) is used for detecting normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation (AF), and noise in ECG signals to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed model uses ECG signals as input and provides results in the form of the presence or absence of disease AF, and classifies other signals as normal, other, or noise. This article derives different features from the signal using Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC) and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) technique, and then classifies them based on their attributes. Since the ECG contains some kind of noise and irregular data streams so the purpose of this study is to remove artifacts from the ECG signal by deploying the method of Second-Order-Section (SOS) (filter) and correctly classify them. Several features were extracted to improve the detection of ECG data. Compared with existing methods, this work gives promising results and can help improve the classification accuracy of the ECG signals.

AB  - Study Objectives: To improve sleep quality assessment using a single chest-worn sensor by extracting body acceleration and sleep position changes.
   Methods: Sleep patterns of 21 participants (50.8 +/- 12.8 years, 47.8% female) with self-reported sleep problems were simultaneously recorded using a chest sensor (Chest), an Actiwatch (Wrist), and polysomnography (PSG) during overnight sleep laboratory assessment. An algorithm for Chest was developed to detect sleep/wake epochs based on body acceleration and sleep position/postural changes data, which were then used to estimate sleep parameters of interest. Comparisons between Chest and Wrist with respect to PSG were performed. Identification of sleep/wake epochs was assessed by estimating sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Agreement between sensor-derived sleep parameters and PSG was assessed using correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis.
   Results: Chest identified sleep/wake epochs with an accuracy of on average 6% higher than Wrist (85.8% versus 79.8%). Similar trends were observed for sensitivity/specificity values. Correlation between Wrist and PSG was poor for most of the sleep parameters of interest (r = 0.0-0.3); however, Chest and PSG correlation showed moderate to strong agreement (r = 0.4-0.8) with relatively low bias and high precision bias (precision): 9.2 (13.2) minutes for sleep onset latency; 17.3(34.8) minutes for total sleep time; 7.5 (29.8) minutes for wake after sleep onset; and 2.0 (7.3)% for sleep efficacy.
   Conclusions: Combination of sleep postural/position changes and body acceleration improved detection of sleep/wake epochs compared to wrist acceleration alone. The chest sensors also improved estimation of sleep parameters of interest with stronger agreement with PSG. Our findings may expand the application of wearable sensors to clinically assess sleep outside of a sleep laboratory.

AB  - This study reports a microfluidic chip-based wearable colorimetric sensor for detecting sweat glucose. The device consisted of five microfluidic channels branching out from the center and connected to the detection microchambers. The microchannels could route the sweat excreted from the epidermis to the microchambers, and each of them was integrated with a check valve to avoid the risk of the backflow of the chemical reagents from the microchamber. The microchambers contained the pre-embedded glucose oxidase (GOD)-peroxidase-o-dianisidine reagents for sensing the glucose in sweat. It was found that the color change caused by the enzymatic oxidation of o-dianisidine could show a more sensitive response to the glucose than that of the conventional GOD-peroxidase-KI system. This sensor could perform five parallel detections at one time. The obtained linear range for sweat glucose was 0.1-0.5 mM with a limit of detection of 0.03 mM. The sensor was also used to detect the glucose in sweat samples from a group of subjects engaged in both fasting and postprandial trials. The results showed that our wearable colorimetric sensor can reveal the subtle differences existing in the sweat glucose concentration after the fasting and the oral glucose uptake.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases have been reported to be the leading cause of mortality across the globe. Among such diseases, Myocardial Infarction (MI), also known as "heart attack", is of main interest among researchers, as its early diagnosis can prevent life threatening cardiac conditions and potentially save human lives. Analyzing the Electrocardiogram (ECG) can provide valuable diagnostic information to detect different types of cardiac arrhythmia. Real-time ECG monitoring systems with advanced machine learning methods provide information about the health status in real-time and have improved user's experience. However, advanced machine learning methods have put a burden on portable and wearable devices due to their high computing requirements. We present an improved, less complex Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based classifier model that identifies multiple arrhythmia types using the two-dimensional image of the ECG wave in real-time. The proposed model is presented as a three-layer ECG signal analysis model that can potentially be adopted in real-time portable and wearable monitoring devices. We have designed, implemented, and simulated the proposed CNN network using Matlab. We also present the hardware implementation of the proposed method to validate its adaptability in real-time wearable systems. The European ST-T database recorded with single lead L3 is used to validate the CNN classifier and achieved an accuracy of 99.23%, outperforming most existing solutions.

AB  - The recovery of symmetric and efficient walking is one of the key goals of a rehabilitation program in patients with stroke. The use of overground exoskeletons alongside conventional gait training might help foster rhythmic muscle activation in the gait cycle toward a more efficient gait. About twenty-nine patients with subacute stroke have been recruited and underwent either conventional gait training or experimental training, including overground gait training using a wearable powered exoskeleton alongside conventional therapy. Before and after the rehabilitation treatment, we assessed: (i) gait functionality by means of clinical scales combined to obtain a Capacity Score, and (ii) gait neuromuscular lower limbs pattern using superficial EMG signals. Both groups improved their ability to walk in terms of functional gait, as detected by the Capacity Score. However, only the group treated with the robotic exoskeleton regained a controlled rhythmic neuromuscular pattern in the proximal lower limb muscles, as observed by the muscular activation analysis. Coherence analysis suggested that the control group (CG) improvement was mediated mainly by spinal cord control, while experimental group improvements were mediated by cortical-driven control. In subacute stroke patients, we hypothesize that exoskeleton multijoint powered fine control overground gait training, alongside conventional care, may lead to a more fine-tuned and efficient gait pattern.

AB  - Physical exercise has become an essential tool for treating various non-communicable diseases (also known as chronic diseases). Due to this, physical exercise allows to counter different symptoms and reduce some risk of death factors without medication. A solution to support people in doing exercises is to use artificial systems that monitor their exercise progress. While one crucial aspect is to monitor the correct physical motions for rehabilitative exercise, another essential element is to give encouraging feedback during workouts. A coaching system can track a user's exhaustion and give motivating feedback accordingly to boost exercise adherence. For this purpose, this research investigates whether it is possible to predict the subjective exhaustion level based on non-invasive and non-wearable technology. A novel data set was recorded with the facial record as the primary predictor and individual exhaustion levels as the predicted variable. 60 participants (30 male, 30 female) took part in the data recording. 17 facial action units (AU) were extracted as predictor variables for the perceived subjective exhaustion measured using the BORG scale. Using the predictor and the target variables, several regression and classification methods were evaluated aiming to predict exhaustion. The results showed that the decision tree and support vector methods provide reasonable prediction results. The limitation of the results, depending on participants being in the training data set and subjective variables (e.g., participants smiling during the exercises) were further discussed.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the lifelong diseases that require systematic medical care to avoid life-menacing ramifications. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause severe damage to most internal body organs, probably leading to death. Particularly, nocturnal hypoglycemic that occur usually at night during sleep. Severe cases of these events can lead to seizures, fainting, loss of consciousness, and death. The current medical devices lack to give the warning to reduce the risk of acquiring nocturnal hypoglycemic events because they use only for glucose monitoring during waking times. Consequently, the main goal of this work is to design and implement a new wearable device to detect and monitor tremors, which occur when a user has hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). The device can detect a frequency range of 4-12 Hz by using the accelerometer of Arduino Nano 33 BLE. It can send a signal to the phone application (app) via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Once the phone receives a signal, the phone application can activate an alarm system to wake up the patient, call three selected contacts number, and universal emergency number. In case of the user is unresponsive, the app can provide the patient's location, name, and date of birth to the emergency contacts numbers and universal emergency number. Additionally, the device cost is economically feasible and competitive compared to other medical devices.

AB  - Diabetes is featured by the high prevalence and low control resulting in high premature mortality rate. Maintaining the blood glucose level can bring considerable medical benefits and reduces the risk of diabetes. In real-time, continuous monitoring of blood glucose level is the major challenge. However, monitoring only glucose level without considering other factors such as ECG and physical activities can mislead to improper medication. Therefore, the ever-growing requirement for omnipresent healthcare system has engaged promising technologies such as the Internet of Things and cloud computing. Utilization of these techniques result with the computational complexity, high latency, and mobility problems. To address the aforesaid issues, we propose an energy efficient fog-assisted healthcare system to maintain the blood glucose level. The J48Graft decision tree is used to predict the risk level of diabetes with higher classification accuracy. By deploying fog computing, an emergency alert is generated immediately for precautionary measures. Experimental results illustrate the improved performance of the proposed system in terms of energy efficiency, prediction accuracy, computational complexity, and latency.

AB  - Objective. The wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device is an effective tool for diagnosing intermittent heart diseases. However, the massive amount of ECG data increases power consumption during wireless transmission, thereby reducing the monitoring duration of the wearable device. Here, we presented a novel method to solve this problem. Method. To reduce the data size, we used a down-sampling operation to compress signals. Then, we designed a signal-referenced network to reconstruct the original signals from the compressed ones. We validated the proposed method on the China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 database, used the root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate the performance of the proposed network, and evaluated the effectiveness of the reconstructed signals via the F1-score of an ECG signal classifier. Main Result. The classifier used in this paper achieved an F1-score of 84% on 500 Hz signals reconstructed from 25 Hz, 89% from 50 Hz, 90% from 125 Hz, and 95% from 250 Hz. The RMSE of these four sampling rates was 0.10 mV, 0.08 mV, 0.05 mV, and 0.04 mV, respectively. Significance. The experimental result shows that the proposed network has a good performance when reconstructing signals. Furthermore, our method can remove the computational load of compressing signals from wearable devices.

AB  - A new wave of portable biosensors allows frequent measurement of health-related physiology. We investigated the use of these devices to monitor human physiological changes during various activities and their role in managing health and diagnosing and analyzing disease. By recording over 250,000 daily measurements for up to 43 individuals, we found personalized circadian differences in physiological parameters, replicating previous physiological findings. Interestingly, we found striking changes in particular environments, such as airline flights (decreased peripheral capillary oxygen saturation [SpO(2)] and increased radiation exposure). These events are associated with physiological macro-phenotypes such as fatigue, providing a strong association between reduced pressure/oxygen and fatigue on high-altitude flights. Importantly, we combined biosensor information with frequent medical measurements and made two important observations: First, wearable devices were useful in identification of early signs of Lyme disease and inflammatory responses; we used this information to develop a personalized, activity-based normalization framework to identify abnormal physiological signals from longitudinal data for facile disease detection. Second, wearables distinguish physiological differences between insulin-sensitive and - resistant individuals. Overall, these results indicate that portable biosensors provide useful information for monitoring personal activities and physiology and are likely to play an important role in managing health and enabling affordable health care access to groups traditionally limited by socioeconomic class or remote geography.

AB  - Sleep is an essential and vital element of a person's life and health that helps to refresh and recharge the mind and body of a person. The quality of sleep is very important in every person's lifestyle, removing various diseases. Bad sleep is a big problem for a lot of people for a very long time. People suffering from various diseases are dealing with various sleeping disorders, commonly known as sleep apnea. A lot of people die during sleep because of uneven body changes in the body during sleep. On that note, a system to monitor sleep is very important. Most of the previous systems to monitor sleeping problems cannot deal with the real time sleeping problem, generating data after a certain period of sleep. Real-time monitoring of sleep is the key to detecting sleep apnea. To solve this problem, an Internet of Things- (IoT-) based real-time sleep apnea monitoring system has been developed. It will allow the user to measure different indexes of sleep and will notify them through a mobile application when anything odd occurs. The system contains various sensors to measure the electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, pulse rate, skin response, and SpO2 of any person during the entire sleeping period. This research is very useful as it can measure the indexes of sleep without disturbing the person and can also show it in the mobile application simultaneously with the help of a Bluetooth module. The system has been developed in such a way that it can be used by every kind of person. Multiple analog sensors are used with the Arduino UNO to measure different parameters of the sleep factor. The system was examined and tested on different people's bodies. To analyze and detect sleep apnea in real-time, the system monitors several people during the sleeping period. The results are displayed on the monitor of the Arduino boards and in the mobile application. The analysis of the achieved data can detect sleep apnea in some of the people that the system monitored, and it can also display the reason why sleep apnea happens. This research also analyzes the people who are not in the danger of sleeping problems by the achieved data. This paper will help everyone learn about sleep apnea and will help people detect it and take the necessary steps to prevent it.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurring after cardiac surgery is associated with adverse outcomes. Whether POAF persists beyond discharge is not well defined.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring enhances detection of POAF among cardiac surgical patients during the first 30 days after hospital discharge compared with usual care.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted at 10 Canadian centers. Enrollment spanned from March 2017 to March 2020, with follow-up through September 11, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment stopped on July 17, 2020, at which point 85% of the proposed sample size was enrolled. Cardiac surgical patients with CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >= 75 years, diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, female sex) score greater than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 2 with risk factors for POAF, no history of preoperative AF, and POAF lasting less than 24 hours during hospitalization were enrolled.
   INTERVENTIONS The intervention group underwent continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with wearable, patch-based monitors for 30 days after randomization. Monitoring was not mandated in the usual care group within 30 days after randomization.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was cumulative AF and/or atrial flutter lasting 6 minutes or longer detected by continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring or by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. Prespecified secondary outcomes included cumulative AF lasting 6 hours or longer and 24 hours or longer within 30 days of randomization, death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, non-central nervous system thromboembolism, major bleeding, and oral anticoagulation prescription.
   RESULTS Of the 336 patients randomized (163 patients in the intervention group and 173 patients in the usual care group; mean [SD] age, 67.4 [8.1] years; 73 women [21.7%]; median [interquartile range] CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, 4.0 [3.0-4.0] points), 307 (91.4%) completed the trial. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the primary end point occurred in 32 patients (19.6%) in the intervention group vs 3 patients (1.7%) in the usual care group (absolute difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 11.5%-24.3%; P < .001). AF lasting 6 hours or longer was detected in 14 patients (8.6%) in the intervention group vs 0 patients in the usual care group (absolute difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 4.3%-12.9%; P < .001).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In post-cardiac surgical patients at high risk of stroke, no preoperative AF history, and AF lasting less than 24 hours during hospitalization, continuous monitoring revealed a significant increase in the rate of POAF after discharge that would otherwise not be detected by usual care. Studies are needed to examine whether these patients will benefit from oral anticoagulation therapy.

AB  - We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a multi-sensor, low-power necklace, NeckSense, for automatically and unobtrusively capturing fine-grained information about an individual's eating activity and eating episodes, across an entire waking day in a naturalistic setting. NeckSense fuses and classifies the proximity of the necklace from the chin, the ambient light, the Lean Forward Angle, and the energy signals to determine chewing sequences, a building block of the eating activity. It then clusters the identified chewing sequences to determine eating episodes. We tested NeckSense on 11 participants with and 9 participants without obesity, across two studies, where we collected more than 470 hours of data in a naturalistic setting. Our results demonstrate that NeckSense enables reliable eating detection for individuals with diverse body mass index (BMI) profiles, across an entire waking day, even in free-living environments. Overall, our system achieves an F1-score of 81.6% in detecting eating episodes in an exploratory study. Moreover, our system can achieve an F1-score of 77.1% for episodes even in an all-day-long free-living setting. With more than 15.8 hours of battery life, NeckSense will allow researchers and dietitians to better understand natural chewing and eating behaviors. In the future, researchers and dietitians can use NeckSense to provide appropriate real-time interventions when an eating episode is detected or when problematic eating is identified.

AB  - In this work, we present a clinical decision support system enabled by the AI methodology including deep neural network (DNN) in association with IoT cloud for the forecasting healthcare of the patient and is analysed by considering chronic kidney disease (CKD) to provide the optimum healthcare services to consumers with its severity level utilising e-health apps. The proposed system gathers patient details from their IoT devices and their healthcare records from the UCI repository are being saved in the cloud aided in the customisation of health therapies for particular populations. In addition, the identification and severity of the disease are performed using a deep neural network (DNN) classifier. A particle swarm optimisation (PSO)-based feature extraction is utilised to increase the effectiveness of the DNN classifier. The standard CKD dataset is used to verify the proposed approach. The proposed approach is evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, F-score and specificity.

AB  - Background: Patients with colorectal cancer who undergo surgery face many postoperative problems. These problems include the risk of relapse, side effects, and long-term complications.Objective: This study sought to design and develop a remote monitoring system as a technological solution for the postdischarge care of these patients.Methods: This research was conducted in 3 main steps: system feature extraction, system design, and evaluation. After feature extraction from a systematic review, the necessary features were defined by 18 clinical experts in Iran. In the next step, the architecture of the system was designed based on the requirements; the software and hardware parts of the system were embedded in the architecture, then the software system components were drawn using the unified modeling language diagrams, and the details of software system implementation were identified. Regarding the hardware design, different accessible hardware modules were evaluated, and suitable ones were selected. Finally, the usability of the system was evaluated by demonstrating it over a Skype virtual meeting session and using Nilsen's usability principles.Results: A total of 21 mandatory features in 5 main categories, including patient information registration, periodic monitoring of health parameters, education, reminders, and assessments, were defined and validated for the system. The software was developed using an ASP.Net core backend, a Microsoft SQL Server database, and an Ionic frontend alongside the Angular framework, to build an Android app. The user roles of the system included 3 roles: physicians, patients, and the system administrator. The hardware was designed to contain an Esp8266 as the Internet of Things module, an MLX90614 infrared temperature sensor, and the Maxim Integrated MAX30101 sensor for sensing the heartbeat. The hardware was designed in the shape of a wristband device using SolidWorks 2020 and printed using a 3D printer. The firmware of the hardware was developed in Arduino with the capability of firmware over the air. In evaluating the software system from the perspective of usability, the system received an average score of 3.8 out of 5 from 4 evaluators.Conclusions: Sensor-based telemonitoring systems for patients with colorectal cancer after surgery are possible solutions that can make the process automatic for patients and caregivers. The apps for remote colorectal patient monitoring could be designed to be useful; however, more research regarding the developed system's implementation in clinic settings and hospitals is required to understand the probable barriers and limitations.

AB  - Physical exercise contributes to the success of rehabilitation programs and rehabilitation processes assisted through social robots. However, the amount and intensity of exercise needed to obtain positive results are unknown. Several considerations must be kept in mind for its implementation in rehabilitation, as monitoring of patients' intensity, which is essential to avoid extreme fatigue conditions, may cause physical and physiological complications. The use of machine learning models has been implemented in fatigue management, but is limited in practice due to the lack of understanding of how an individual's performance deteriorates with fatigue; this can vary based on physical exercise, environment, and the individual's characteristics. As a first step, this paper lays the foundation for a data analytic approach to managing fatigue in walking tasks. The proposed framework establishes the criteria for a feature and machine learning algorithm selection for fatigue management, classifying four fatigue diagnoses states. Based on the proposed framework and the classifier implemented, the random forest model presented the best performance with an average accuracy of >= 98% and F-score of >= 93%. This model was comprised of <= 16 features. In addition, the prediction performance was analyzed by limiting the sensors used from four IMUs to two or even one IMU with an overall performance of >= 88%.

AB  - Cognitive impairment diseases are becoming more and more prevalent mainly due to population aging and the increase in life expectancy. Sensory and monitoring systems may allow people with mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) or at early stages of dementia to live at home for longer with more independence and security. This work presents a wireless sensor network (WSN) based on wearables that obtains indoor and outdoor location and step information, reporting them over a long-range WAN (LoRaWAN) network. Each wireless wearable sensor (WWS) uses a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) module for outdoor positioning, a proposed indoor room-level localization system based on infrared sensors, an accelerometer for a step detector algorithm, and a long-range (LoRa) radio link to send the measured information with low-power consumption achieving a large coverage range. These sensory data are recorded in a database and presented to the medical services and caregivers through a user web application. This can be used to detect anomalous changes in daily patients' routines, as well as to know the user's position in cases where the patient may be disoriented. In addition, alerts are launched in caregivers' smartphones to report about any risky situation, such as the patient leaving an allowed area or staying in one place for too long. Therefore, the proposed sensory system may support and extend the ability of people with MCI or at early stages of dementia to live independently, it helps detect behavioral changes and it keeps caregivers' peace of mind.

AB  - The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The demand for devices or systems to diagnose and track COVID-19 infections noninvasively not only in hospitals but also in home settings has led to increased interest in consumer-grade wearables. A common symptom of COVID-19 is dyspnea, which may manifest as an increase in respiratory and heart rates. In this paper, a novel piezoelectric strain sensor is presented for real-time monitoring of respiratory and heartbeat signals. A highly sensitive and stretchable piezoelectric strain sensor is fabricated using a piezoelectric film with a serpentine layout. The thickness of the patterned PVDF flexible piezoelectric strain sensor is only 168 mu m, and the voltage sensitivity reaches 0.97 mV/mu epsilon. The effective modulus is 13.5 MPa, which allows the device to fit to the skin and detect the small strain exhibited by the human body. Chest vibrations are captured by the piezoelectric sensor, which produces an electrical output voltage signal conformally mapped with respiratory-cardiac activities. The separate heart activity and respiratory signals are extracted from the mixed respiratory-cardiac signal by an empirical mode decomposition data processing algorithm. By detecting vital signals such as respiratory and heart rates, the proposed device can aid early diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19. (C) 2022 Author(s).

AB  - Background: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a disease that requires complex management involving multiple medications, exercise, and lifestyle changes. It mainly affects older patients with depression and anxiety, who commonly find management difficult. Existing mobile apps supporting the self-management of CHF have limited features and are inadequately validated.
   Objective: The HeartMan project aims to develop a personal health system that would comprehensively address CHF self-management by using sensing devices and artificial intelligence methods. This paper presents the design of the system and reports on the accuracy of its patient-monitoring methods, overall effectiveness, and patient perceptions.
   Methods: A mobile app was developed as the core of the HeartMan system, and the app was connected to a custom wristband and cloud services. The system features machine learning methods for patient monitoring: continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation, physical activity monitoring, and psychological profile recognition. These methods feed a decision support system that provides recommendations on physical health and psychological support. The system was designed using a human-centered methodology involving the patients throughout development. It was evaluated in a proof-of-concept trial with 56 patients.
   Results: Fairly high accuracy of the patient-monitoring methods was observed. The mean absolute error of BP estimation was 9.0 mm Hg for systolic BP and 7.0 mm Hg for diastolic BP. The accuracy of psychological profile detection was 88.6%. The F-measure for physical activity recognition was 71%. The proof-of-concept clinical trial in 56 patients showed that the HeartMan system significantly improved self-care behavior (P=.02), whereas depression and anxiety rates were significantly reduced (P<.001), as were perceived sexual problems (P=.01). According to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaire, a positive attitude toward HeartMan was seen among end users, resulting in increased awareness, self-monitoring, and empowerment.
   Conclusions: The HeartMan project combined a range of advanced technologies with human-centered design to develop a complex system that was shown to help patients with CHF. More psychological than physical benefits were observed.

AB  - In this paper, we will propose a novel system for remote detecting COVID-19 patients based on artificial intelligence technology and internet of things (IoT) in order to stop the virus spreading at an early stage. In this work, we will focus on connecting several sensors to work together as a system that can discover people infected with the Coronavirus remotely, this will reduce the spread of the disease. The proposed system consists of several devices called smart medical sensors such as: pulse, thermal monitoring, and blood sensors. The system is working sequentially starting by pulse sensor and end by blood sensor including an algorithm to manage the data given from sensors. The pulse sensor is devoted to acquire a high quality data using a smartphone equipped by a mobile dermatoscope with 20x magnification. The processing is used RGB color system to perform moving window to segment regions of interest (ROIs) as inputs of the heart rate estimation algorithm. The heart rate (HR) estimation is then given by computing the dominant frequency by identifying the most prominent peak of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) technique. The thermal monitoring is used for fever detection using a smart camera that can provide an optimum solution for fever detection. The infrared sensor can quickly measure surface temperature without making any contact with a person's skin. A blood sensor is used to measure percentages of white, red blood (WBCs, RBCs) volume and platelets non-invasively using the bioimpedance analysis and independent component analysis (ICA). The proposed sensor consists of two electrodes which can be used to send the current to the earlobe and measure the produced voltage. A mathematical model was modified to describe the impedance of earlobe in different frequencies (i.e., low, medium, and high). The COMSOL model is used to simulate blood electrical properties and frequencies to measure WBCs, RBCs and Platelets volume. These devices are collected to work automatically without user interaction for remote checking the coronavirus patients. The proposed system is experimented by six examples to prove its applicability and efficiency.

AB  - Background: The main objective of this research was to evaluate the acceptance of technology based on a wearable lifelogging camera in a sample of older adults diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Methods: A mixed-method design was used, consisting of a self-report questionnaire, numerous images taken by users, and a series of focus group discussions. The patients were involved in an individualized training programme.
   Results: Nine MCI patients and their caregiver relatives were included. They showed good acceptance of the camera and downloaded an appropriate number of images on a daily basis. Perceived severity and ease of use were the main factors associated with the intention to use the device.
   Conclusions: Older adults with MCI can become competent users of lifelogging wearable cameras with a good level of acceptance. Privacy concerns are outweighed by the potential benefits for memory. Limitations, strengths and implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - Diabetes prevalence has been rising exponentially, increasing the need for reliable noninvasive approaches for glucose monitoring. Different biofluids have been explored recently for replacing current blood finger-stick glucose strips with noninvasive painless sensing devices. While sweat has received considerable attention, there are mixed reports on correlating the sweat results with blood glucose levels. Here, we demonstrate a new rapid and reliable approach that combines a simple touch-based fingertip sweat electrochemical sensor with a new algorithm that addresses for personal variations toward the accurate estimate of blood glucose concentrations. The new painless and simple glucose selftesting protocol leverages the fast sweat rate on the fingertip for rapid assays of natural perspiration, without any sweat stimulation, along with the personalized sweat-response-to-blood concentration translation. A reliable estimate of the blood glucose sensing concentrations can thus be realized through a simple one-time personal precalibration. Such system training leads to a substantially improved accuracy with a Pearson correlation coefficient higher than 0.95, along with an overall mean absolute relative difference of 7.79%, with 100% paired points residing in the A + B region of the Clarke error grid. The speed and simplicity of the touch-based blood-free fingertip sweat assay, and the elimination of periodic blood calibrations, should lead to frequent self-testing of glucose and enhanced patient compliance toward the improved management of diabetes.

AB  - Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death both globally and in the United Arab Emirates. Despite public health measures and health education, the rates of death from CVD remain stable. Barriers previously identified to lifestyle changes include cultural reasons, boredom, and lack of family support. The Emirates Heart Health Project (EHHP) seeks to support healthy lifestyle changes through a family-based intervention using a health coach and fitness tracker.Methods and analysis The EHHP is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial with each cluster comprised of members of an extended family. Eligible participants will be >= 18 years of age, with BMI >= 25, have Emirati citizenship and be able to give informed consent for study participation. The cluster will have 16 weekly teaching sessions in the participants' family home by a health coach who will review individual weight, diet and exercise (monitored by a wearable fitness tracker). The clusters will have pre-intervention assessments of their weight and CVD risk profile and enter the intervention in randomized order. Each cluster will have a post-intervention assessment of the same measures. The primary outcome is weight reduction from baseline. Secondary outcomes will include change in CVD risk factors such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, waist circumference, and BMI. A mixed linear model will be used for analysis, where the parameters measured at the end of each 16-week episode will be the outcome values. These will be analyzed such that baseline values (measured just prior to the start of an episode) will be fixed covariables. Random effects are the family units. This trial has been registered with the NIH at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04688684) and is being reported using the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) and TIDieR (Template for intervention description and replication) framework.

AB  - The possibilities offered by variable resistance bend sensors, applied as wearable devices on body garments, to recover human joint bend angles for body segment movement tracking, have been investigated, underlying their advantages and drawbacks in real-time applications. Due to their pliability, sensitivity, and cheapness, they could be a valid alternative to movement analysis systems, based on optoelectronic devices or inertial electronic sensors. This paper suggests a new method for sensor characterization under fast bend and extension movements, to extract few parameters of a synthetic model, which provide to the users the chance to foresee their electrical performance in different applications. The sensor and their extracted models were applied to register the human knee rotation during a gait cycle, either at slow speed (83 deg/s) for a walking pattern at 5 km/h, and at high speed (650 deg/s) for a running pattern of a sprinter at 10 m/s, and finally the finger joint rotations at their maximum angular velocity (900 deg/s). This was done for a twofold purpose: from one hand, to assess the model capability to predict the sensor performance, tracking human body segment rotations at different speed, without the need of measurement; from the other hand, to recover in real time the actual sensor rotation from its resistance measurement, especially in high speed applications, where its response is distorted. With this technique, the mean error decreases from 22.5 degrees to 3.7 degrees in the worst case.

AB  - We describe a home health monitoring solution with cardiac beat-to-beat detection using accelerometer and gyroscope signal fusion. The proposed method measures both the precordial translational and rotational motions of the chest using miniaturized inertial sensors. The algorithm removes motion artefacts, selects the best axis from multi-axial accelerometric and gyroscopic signals and detects the location of beats using two detection principles based on the signal envelope and signal morphology. We consider the beat-to-heat detection accuracy, estimate the heart rate and compare the detection performance between the sensor modalities in two study groups: i) healthy subjects and ii) heart disease patients. The average sensitivity and precision of the beat detection were 99.9% and 99.6% for the healthy subjects and 96.1% and 95.6% for the heart disease patients, respectively. Although high-accuracy beat detection was achieved for the heart disease patients, location matching in these patients was found to be less accurate compared to that of the healthy subjects. The average root mean square error (RMSE) between the mechanical and ECG interbeat intervals was 5.6 ms for the healthy patients; this error increased approximately 10-fold for the heart disease patients. Similarly, the RMSE for the averaged heart rate estimation showed about a 10-fold difference at 1.05 beats per minute for the heart disease patients. The used sensor modalities are found in many electronic devices, such as smartphones and wearable technologies and this method provides a step towards ubiquitous cardiac monitoring.

AB  - Even after two years since the declaration of the new virus Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19), the reported cases are still considerably high in many countries, including Malaysia. The health authorities cannot monitor the health condition and track the location of every home-monitored patient at once due to many confirmed cases in a day. In order to overcome the shortage of manpower, an Internet of Things (IoT)-based self-quarantine system with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Global Positioning System (GPS) tracking is proposed in this paper to monitor the health conditions of the Covid-19 patients and track their real-time location via mobile application. Biomedical sensors are used to measure health conditions such as temperature, pulse oximetry, and heart-rate monitor. In addition, the RFID readers are used to detect patients that intend to leave the quarantine area, and the GPS modules are used to track their actual geometrical location so that the authorities can take further action. The real-time data is automatically pushed to the cloud server for the authorities to remotely view the patient's health condition and location on the Google map using smart devices. Finally, a hardware prototype and a mobile application have been successfully developed in this project The system is able to display the temperature, heartbeats, and blood oxygen saturation properly on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen. All these measured values, together with the information from RFID detection and GPS location tracking, can be viewed on a smartphone.

AB  - Background: Novel wearable biosensors, ubiquitous smartphone ownership, and telemedicine are converging to enable new paradigms of clinical research. A new generation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices provides access to clinical-grade measurement of interstitial glucose levels. Adoption of these sensors has become widespread for the management of type 1 diabetes and is accelerating in type 2 diabetes. In parallel, individuals are adopting health-related smartphone-based apps to monitor and manage care.
   Objective: We conducted a proof-of-concept study to investigate the potential of collecting robust, annotated, real-time clinical study measures of glucose levels without clinic visits.
   Methods: Self-administered meal-tolerance tests were conducted to assess the impact of a proprietary synbiotic medical food on glucose control in a 6-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2x2 cross-over pilot study (n=6). The primary endpoint was incremental glucose measured using Abbott Freestyle Libre CGM devices associated with a smartphone app that provided a visual diet log.
   Results: All subjects completed the study and mastered CGM device usage. Over 40 days, 3000 data points on average per subject were collected across three sensors. No adverse events were recorded, and subjects reported general satisfaction with sensor management, the study product, and the smartphone app, with an average self-reported satisfaction score of 8.25/10. Despite a lack of sufficient power to achieve statistical significance, we demonstrated that we can detect meaningful changes in the postprandial glucose response in real-world settings, pointing to the merits of larger studies in the future.
   Conclusions: We have shown that CGM devices can provide a comprehensive picture of glucose control without clinic visits. CGM device usage in conjunction with our custom smartphone app can lower the participation burden for subjects while reducing study costs, and allows for robust integration of multiple valuable data types with glucose levels remotely.

AB  - Along with the rapid development of modern high-tech and the change of people's awareness of healthy life, the demand for personal healthcare services is gradually increasing. The rapid progress of information and communication technology and medical and bio technology not only improves personal healthcare services, but also brings the fact that the human being has entered the era of longevity. At present, there are many researches focused on various wearable sensing devices and implant devices and Internet of Things in order to capture personal daily life health information more conveniently and effectively, and significant results have been obtained, such as fog computing. To provide personal healthcare services, the fog and cloud computing is an effective solution for sharing health information. The health big data analysis model can provide personal health situation reports on a daily basis, and the gene sequencing can provide hereditary disease prediction. However, the injury mortality and emergency diseases since long ago caused death and great pain for the family. And there are no effective rescue methods to save precious lives and no methods to predict the disease morbidity likelihood. The purpose of this research is to capture personal daily health information based on sensors and monitoring emergency situations with the help of fog computing and mobile applications, and disease prediction based on cloud computing and big data analysis. Through the comparison of test results it was proved that the proposed emergency monitoring based on fog and cloud computing and the diseases prediction model based on big data analysis not only gain more of the rescue time than the traditional emergency treatment method, but they also accumulate lots of different personal healthcare related experience. The Taian 960 hospital of PLA and the Yanbian Hospital as IM testbed were joined to provide emergency monitoring tests, and to ensure the CVD and CVA morbidity likelihood medical big data analysis, the people around Taian city participated in personal health tests. Through the project, the five network layers architecture and integrated MAPE-K Model based EMDPS platform not only made the cooperation between hospitals feasible to deal with emergency situations, but also the Internet medicine for the disease prediction was built.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is aimed at identifying current subject task performed by a person as a result of analyzing data from wearable sensors. HAR is a very challenging task that has been applied in different areas such as rehabilitation and localization. During the past ten years, plenty of models, number of sensors and sensor placements, and feature transformations have been reported for this task. From this bunch of previous ideas, what seems to be clear is that the very specific applications drive to the selection of the best choices for each case.
   Present research is focused on early diagnosis of stroke, what involves reducing the feature space of gathered data and subsequent MAR, among other tasks. In this study, an Information Correlation Coefficient (ICC) analysis was carried out followed by a wrapper Feature Selection (FS) method on the reduced input space. Additionally, a novel MAR method is proposed for this specific problem of stroke early diagnosing, comprising an adaptation of the well-known Genetic Fuzzy Finite State Machine (GFFSM) method.
   To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the very first analysis of the feature space concerning all the previously published feature transformations on raw acceleration data. The main contributions of this study are the optimization of the sample rate, selection of the best feature subset, and learning of a suitable HAR method based on GFFSM to be applied to the HAR problem.

AB  - In medical practices, the detection of diseases highly depends on different medical tests. Electrocardiogram (ECG) technique is commonly used for heart disease diagnosis. Doctors can measure pulse and other heart boundaries with the aid of it. Fast and precise detection of forms of arrhythmia is critical while identifying heart disease. In this work, we proposed an intelligent ECG device (called iKardo) with the built-in automatic capability to classify into critical and non-critical data from an imbalanced ECG dataset for the smart IoT or Internet of Things based smart healthcare device. Particular emphasis is given to the reduction of data misclassification by converting imbalanced data into a balanced dataset using necessary techniques. This proposed iKardo helps in the accurate detection of critical ECG beats with an accuracy of 99.58% and result in a smart healthcare monitoring device that would make the disease detection fast and precise.

AB  - Ischemic stroke is a cerebral hemodynamic disorder that occurs due to the impairment of hemoglobin supply to the tissue, a leading cause of mortality around the world. This research focuses on detecting ischemic stroke conditions by adding new hemodynamic biomarker information to the proposed low-cost wearable point-of-care diagnostic near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) device. Consequently, a new protocol- based sequence of experiments has been carried out to detect the ischemic condition. First, amultichannel, multiwavelength, and multibiomarkers- based point-ofcare NIRS system has been developed to accommodate these features onboard. A four-wavelength, six-optode channelsbased NIRS probe has been designed such that the physiological noise gets minimized and covers 100 mm x 20 mm area of tissue, for example, the frontal lobe of the brain, with near and far distance concept of optode channels. Infinite impulse response (IIR) filters have been used onboard to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) up to 58.17 dB of the measured biomarker signal. The proposed pipeline of in- vivo occlusion experimentation evoked the ischemic condition at various stages to validate the system performance and temporal characteristics of biomarkers. First, basic PPG signals have recorded to test the performance of the device against the standard PPG signal, then the device has been placed a little upward from the finger to the forearm, where forearm occlusion has been done to mimic the ischemic condition, and finally, the device has beenmoved further upward and placed at the frontal lobe to record the evoked ischemic biomarker's response while blocking the carotid artery.

AB  - Chronic neurological disorders (CND's) are lifelong diseases and cannot be eradicated, but their severe effects can be alleviated by early preemptive measures. CND's, such as Alzheimer's, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), are the chronic ailment of the central nervous system that causes the degradation of emotional and cognitive abilities. Long term continuous monitoring with neuro-feedback of human emotions for patients with CND's is crucial in mitigating its harmful effect. This paper presents hardware efficient and dedicated human emotion classification processor for CND's. Scalp EEG is used for the emotion's classification using the valence and arousal scales. A linear support vector machine classifier is used with power spectral density, logarithmic interhemispheric power spectral ratio, and the interhemispheric power spectral difference of eight EEG channel locations suitable for a wearable non-invasive classification system. A look-up-table based logarithmic division unit (LDU) is to represent the division features in machine learning (ML) applications. The implemented LDU minimizes the cost of integer division by 34% for ML applications. The implemented emotion's classification processor achieved an accuracy of 72.96% and 73.14%, respectively, for the valence and arousal classification on multiple publicly available datasets. The 2 x 3mm(2) processor is fabricated using a 0.18 mu m 1P6M CMOS process with power and energy utilization of 2.04 mW and 16 mu J/classification, respectively, for 8-channel operation.

AB  - Background Gait was proved to be strongly associated with global cognitive function and multiple cognitive domains; however, previous research usually concentrated on individual gait parameters. This study used wearable sensors to measure gait parameters in different aspects and comprehensively explored the association of gait with global cognitive function and cognitive domains. Methods The data of this cross-sectional study were obtained from 236 community-dwelling Japanese older adults (125 men and 111 women) aged 70-81 years. Gait was measured by asking participants to walk a 6-m course and back using the Physilog (R) sensors (GaiUp (R), Switzerland). Global cognitive function and cognitive domains were evaluated by face-to-face interviews using the Japanese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Twenty gait parameters were summarized as independent gait factors using factor analysis. A generalized linear model and linear regression model were used to explore the relationship of gait with global cognitive function and cognitive domains adjusted for several confounding factors. Results Factor analysis yielded four gait factors: general cycle, initial contact, propulsion, and mid-swing. Among them, general cycle factor was significantly associated with global cognitive function (beta = - 0.487, [- 0.890, - 0.085]) and executive function (P = 0.049); initial contact was associated with executive function (P = 0.017). Conclusion General cycle of gait might be the better marker of global cognitive function and gait is most strongly associated with executive function. The longitudinal relationships should be examined in future cohort studies.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that threatens >10 million people annually. Despite advances in TB diagnostics, patients continue to receive an insufficient diagnosis as TB symptoms are not specific. Many existing biodiagnostic tests are slow, have low clinical performance, and can be unsuitable for resource-limited settings. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a rapid, sputum-free, and cost-effective triage test for real-time detection of TB is urgently needed. This article reports on a new diagnostic pathway enabling a noninvasive, fast, and highly accurate way of detecting TB. The approach relies on TB-specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are detected and quantified from the skin headspace. A specifically designed nanomaterial-based sensors array translates these findings into a point-of-care diagnosis by discriminating between active pulmonary TB patients and controls with sensitivity above 90%. This fulfills the WHO's triage test requirements and poses the potential to become a TB triage test.

AB  - Nowadays, more people are affected by various diseases such as blood pressure, heart failure, etc. The early prediction of diseases tends to increase the survival of affected patients by allowing preventive action. A key element for this purpose is the digitalization of the healthcare system through the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing. Nevertheless, there are major problems in the cloud with the IoT due to false predictions and errors in medical data, which results in taking a longer time to receive patient details and not providing the best outcome. Data transfer through the cloud can also be hacked by attackers due to the lack of security. This leads to a challenge for medical experts to predict the diseases accurately for a specific patient. Therefore, a novel hybrid elapid encryption (HEE) method was proposed for improving the security of cloud systems. In addition, the affected person's disease and the severity risk level were predicted and classified using the proposed novel hybridization technique of the generalized-fuzzy-intelligence-based gray wolf ant lion optimization (GFI-GWALO) method. After the disease is predicted, the alert signal is provided to the patients. Moreover, this proposed research was implemented on MATLAB. Then the proposed simulation outcome was compared with various conventional methods and showed that the proposed method has the best outcomes in terms of its security and disease prediction with 80 ms of encryption time and 78 ms of decryption time, 100% accuracy, 99.50% precision and 8 ms of processing time.

AB  - With the alarming rise in the deaths due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD), present medical research scenario places notable importance on techniques and methods to detect CVDs. As adduced by world health organization, technological proceeds in the field of cardiac function assessment have become the nucleus and heart of all leading research studies in CVDs in which electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is the most functional and convenient tool used to test the range of heart-related irregularities. Most of the approaches present in the literature of ECG signal analysis consider noise removal, rhythm-based analysis, and heartbeat detection to improve the performance of a cardiac pacemaker. Advancements achieved in the field of ECG segments detection and beat classification have a limited evaluation and still require clinical approvals. In this paper, approaches on techniques to implement on-chip ECG detector for a cardiac pacemaker system are discussed. Moreover, different challenges regarding the ECG signal morphology analysis deriving from medical literature is extensively reviewed. It is found that robustness to noise, wavelet parameter choice, numerical efficiency, and detection performance are essential performance indicators required by a state-of-the-art ECG detector. Furthermore, many algorithms described in the existing literature are not verified using ECG data from the standard databases. Some ECG detection algorithms show very high detection performance with the total number of detected QRS complexes. However, the high detection performance of the algorithm is verified using only a few datasets. Finally, gaps in current advancements and testing are identified, and the primary challenge remains to be implementing bullseye test for morphology analysis evaluation.

AB  - Gait events and temporal parameters are presently identified by requiring both patient and healthcare professional to be present at a gait laboratory. This requirement is not feasible for the general population in developing countries, where access to such laboratories is limited and costly. Therefore, an inexpensive gait monitoring device has great potential to address this limitation. This paper presents the development of a low cost wearable wireless device that relies on gyroscopic data to: 1) identify gait events, that is, heel-strike (HS) and toe-off (TO), and 2) determine gait temporal parameters. This wearable device is to be worn around the human foot and ankle. It relies on heuristics and zero-crossing method to detect HS and TO accurately. In the experimental study, the identified gait events were benchmarked against force plate. The average errors were found to be between-20.45 and-17.33 ms for HS and -25.21 and-8.97 ms for TO. The R-2 and Bland Altman plot showed positive and consistent results. These findings demonstrated the viability of the proposed system in identifying gait events and determining gait temporal parameters.

AB  - Inactivity, lack of sleep, and poor nutrition predispose individuals to health risks. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) assess physical behaviours and psychological states but are subject of self-reporting biases. Conversely, wearables are an increasingly accurate source of behavioural Technology-Reported Outcomes (TechROs). However, the extent to which PROs and TechROs provide convergent information is unknown. We propose the coQoL PRO-TechRO co-calibration method and report its feasibility, reliability, and human factors influencing data quality. Thirty-nine seniors provided 7.4 +/- 4.4 PROs for physical activity (IPAQ), social support (MSPSS), anxiety/depression (GADS), nutrition (PREDIMED, SelfMNA), memory (MFE), sleep (PSQI), Quality of Life (EQ-5D-3L), and 295 +/- 238 days of TechROs (Fitbit Charge 2) along two years. We co-calibrated PROs and TechROs by Spearman rank and reported human factors guiding coQoL use. We report high PRO-TechRO correlations (r(S) >= 0.8) for physical activity (moderate domestic activity-light+fair active duration), social support (family help-fair activity), anxiety/depression (numeric score-sleep duration), or sleep (duration to sleep-sleep duration) at various durations (7-120 days). coQoL feasibly co-calibrates constructs within physical behaviours and psychological states in seniors. Our results can inform designs of longitudinal observations and, whenever appropriate, personalized behavioural interventions.

AB  - Background: Physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increase the risk of chronic illness and death. The newest generation of "wearable" activity trackers offers potential as a multifaceted intervention to help people become more active.
   Objective: To examine the usability and usefulness of wearable activity trackers for older adults living with chronic illness.
   Methods: We recruited a purposive sample of 32 participants over the age of 50, who had been previously diagnosed with a chronic illness, including vascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, and osteoporosis. Participants were between 52 and 84 years of age (mean 64); among the study participants, 23 (72%) were women and the mean body mass index was 31 kg/m(2). Participants tested 5 trackers, including a simple pedometer (Sportline or Mio) followed by 4 wearable activity trackers (Fitbit Zip, Misfit Shine, Jawbone Up 24, and Withings Pulse) in random order. Selected devices represented the range of wearable products and features available on the Canadian market in 2014. Participants wore each device for at least 3 days and evaluated it using a questionnaire developed from the Technology Acceptance Model. We used focus groups to explore participant experiences and a thematic analysis approach to data collection and analysis.
   Results: Our study resulted in 4 themes: (1) adoption within a comfort zone; (2) self-awareness and goal setting; (3) purposes of data tracking; and (4) future of wearable activity trackers as health care devices. Prior to enrolling, few participants were aware of wearable activity trackers. Most also had been asked by a physician to exercise more and cited this as a motivation for testing the devices. None of the participants planned to purchase the simple pedometer after the study, citing poor accuracy and data loss, whereas 73% (N=32) planned to purchase a wearable activity tracker. Preferences varied but 50% felt they would buy a Fitbit and 42% felt they would buy a Misfit, Jawbone, or Withings. The simple pedometer had a mean acceptance score of 56/95 compared with 63 for the Withings, 65 for the Misfit and Jawbone, and 68 for the Fitbit. To improve usability, older users may benefit from devices that have better compatibility with personal computers or less-expensive Android mobile phones and tablets, and have comprehensive paper-based user manuals and apps that interpret user data.
   Conclusions: For older adults living with chronic illness, wearable activity trackers are perceived as useful and acceptable. New users may need support to both set up the device and learn how to interpret their data.

AB  - Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions are widespread and significantly impact the quality of life and healthcare. Stool appearance is a valuable GI diagnostic indicator, and with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), daily monitoring of excreta from a toilet is emerging as a promising digital health tool. This article describes a stool image analysis approach that classifies two physiologically relevant stool characteristics: 1) form and 2) color for an IoT-based smart toilet. We constructed a stool image data set with 3275 images, spanning all seven types of the Bristol stool-form scale (BSFS), a widely used metric for stool consistency and a variety of colors. We used ground-truth data obtained through the annotation of our data set by two gastroenterologists and developed a stool-color card to standardize the labeling of stool colors. We addressed two limitations associated with the application of computer-vision techniques to a smart-toilet system: 1) uneven separability between different stool-form categories and 2) class imbalance in the data set. We present results on hierarchical convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for training a stool-form classifier and on perceptual color quantization coupled with machine-learning techniques to optimize the color-feature space for the classification of stool color. We utilized an edge-cloud approach to pursue an optimal balance between accuracy and latency and for the classification of stool form, we achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.4% and 84.2% reduction in latency compared to a cloud-model only. For color classification, the logistic-regression (LR) classifier provided 80.8% balanced accuracy and 47.3% reduction in communication latency.

AB  - Wearable hand robots are becoming an attractive means in the facilitating of assistance with daily living and hand rehabilitation exercises for patients after stroke. Pattern recognition is a crucial step toward the development of wearable hand robots. Electromyography (EMG) is a commonly used biological signal for hand pattern recognition. However, the EMG based pattern recognition performance in assistive and rehabilitation robotics post stroke remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, low cost kinematic sensors such as Leap Motion is recently used for pattern recognition in various applications. This study proposes feature fusion and decision fusion method that combines EMG features and kinematic features for hand pattern recognition toward application in upper limb assistive and rehabilitation robotics. Ten normal subjects and five post stroke patients participating in the experiments were tested with eight hand patterns of daily activities while EMG and kinematics were recorded simultaneously. Results showed that average hand pattern recognition accuracy for post stroke patients was 83% for EMG features only, 84.71% for kinematic features only, 96.43% for feature fusion of EMG and kinematics, 91.18% for decision fusion of EMG and kinematics. The feature fusion and decision fusion was robust as three different levels of noise was given to the classifiers resulting in small decrease of classification accuracy. Different channel combination comparisons showed the fusion classifiers would be robust despite failure of specific EMG channels which means that the system has promising potential in the field of assistive and rehabilitation robotics. Future work will be conducted with real-time pattern classification on stroke survivors.

AB  - The transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a kind of sudden disease, which has the characteristics of short duration and high frequency. Since most patients can return to normal after the onset of the disease, it is often neglected. Medical research has proved that patients are prone to stroke in a relatively short time after the transient ischemic attacks. Therefore, it is extremely important to effectively monitor transient ischemic attack, especially for elderly people living alone. At present, video monitoring and wearing sensors are generally used to monitor transient ischemic attacks, but these methods have certain disadvantages. In order to more conveniently and accurately monitor transient ischemic attack in the indoor environment and improve risk management of stroke, this paper uses a microwave sensing platform working in C-Band (4.0 GHz-8.0 GHz) to monitor in a non-contact way. The platform first collects data, then preprocesses the data, and finally uses principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of the data. Two machine learning algorithms support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) are used to establish prediction models respectively. The experimental results show that the accuracy of SVM and RF approaches are 97.3% and 98.7%, respectively; indicating that the scheme described in this paper is feasible and reliable.

AB  - The Real-time wearable Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device is a perfect choice for assisting in detecting cardiovascular disease. A novel ECG beat classification algorithm is presented for continuous heart monitoring on low-processing-capacity wearable devices. We discuss the different wearable wristwatch monitoring system, which allows for continuous 24-h heart rate monitoring. This paper introduces a novel method for classifying arrhythmias based on deep learning. The method relies on QRS/PT detection, Sigma-Delta Modulation (SDM), One-Dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (1D-CNN) algorithms. The QRS/PT wave detection system is based on the 1D-CNN and SDM framework with local minimum and local maximum point algorithms. We proposed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network with a blend classifier. The classifier combines two small LSTM networks' predictions using two different features directly extracted from 1D-CNN and SDM bitstreams. The proposed model is evaluated by detecting QRS/PT waves and classifying arrhythmias using the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database. Five different classifications are performed and evaluated by the AAMI standard: N, F, Q, S, and V. The values for accuracy, positive predictivity, sensitivity, and F1-score are 99.56%, 96.5%, 93.87%, and 95.18%, respectively. The proposed algorithm detects QRS/PT in approximately 2050 ms and classifies each heartbeat in approximately 40-60 ms with wearable devices, and it consumes 1.5 mu w total power. The results indicate that our proposed system outperforms previous research in accuracy and meets both computation time and low power consumption requirements.

AB  - Objective. Current wearable respiratory monitoring devices provide a basic assessment of the breathing pattern of the examined subjects. More complex monitoring is needed for healthcare applications in patients with lung diseases. A multi-sensor vest allowing continuous lung imaging by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) and auscultation at six chest locations was developed for such advanced application. The aims of our study were to determine the vest's capacity to record the intended bio-signals, its safety and the comfort of wearing in a first clinical investigation in healthy adult subjects. Approach. Twenty subjects (age range: 23-65 years) were studied while wearing the vests during a 14-step study protocol comprising phases of quiet and deep breathing, slow and forced full expiration manoeuvres, coughing, breath-holding in seated and three horizontal postures. EIT, chest sound and accelerometer signals were streamed to a tablet using a dedicated application and uploaded to a back-end server. The subjects filled in a questionnaire on the vest properties using a Likert scale. Main results. All subjects completed the full protocol. Good to excellent EIT waveforms and functional EIT images were obtained in 89% of the subjects. Breathing pattern and posture dependent changes in ventilation distribution were properly detected by EIT. Chest sounds were recorded in all subjects. Detection of audible heart sounds was feasible in 44%-67% of the subjects, depending on the sensor location. Accelerometry correctly identified the posture in all subjects. The vests were safe and their properties positively rated, thermal and tactile properties achieved the highest scores. Significance. The functionality and safety of the studied wearable multi-sensor vest and the high level of its acceptance by the study participants were confirmed. Availability of personalized vests might further advance its performance by improving the sensor-skin contact.

AB  - Background: Postural control impairments begin early in Huntington's disease yet measures most sensitive to progression have not been identified. The aims of this study were to: 1) evaluate postural control and gait in people with and without Huntington's disease using wearable sensors; and 2) identify measures related to diagnosis and clinical severity. Methods: 43 individuals with Huntington's disease and 15 age-matched peers performed standing with feet together and feet apart, sitting, and walking with wearable inertial sensors. One-way analysis of variance determined differences in measures of postural control and gait between early and mid-disease stage, and nonHuntington's disease peers. A random forest analysis identified feature importance for Huntington's disease diagnosis. Stepwise and ordinal regressions were used to determine predictors of clinical chorea and tandem walking scores respectively. Findings: There was a significant main effect for all postural control and gait measures comparing early stage, mid stage and non-Huntington's disease peers, except for gait cycle duration and step duration. Total sway, root mean square and mean velocity during sitting, as well as gait speed had the greatest importance in classifying disease status. Stepwise regression showed that root mean square during standing with feet apart significantly predicted clinical measure of chorea, and ordinal regression model showed that root mean square and total sway standing feet together significantly predicted clinical measure of tandem walking. Interpretations: Root mean square measures obtained in sitting and standing using wearable sensors have the potential to serve as biomarkers of postural control impairments in Huntington's disease.

AB  - Sleep is so important, particularly for the elderly. The lack of sleep may increase the risk of cognitive decline. Similarly, it may also increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Nonetheless, many people underestimate the importance of getting enough rest and sleep. In-laboratory polysomnography is the gold-standard method for assessing the quality of sleep. This method is considered impractical in the clinical environment, seen as labour-intensive and expensive owing to its specialised equipment, leading to long waiting lists. Hence, user-friendly (remote and non-intrusive) devices are being developed to help patients monitor their sleep at home. In this paper, we first discuss commercially-available non-wearable devices that measure sleep, in which we highlight the features associated with each device, including sensor type, interface, outputs, dimensions, power supply, and connectivity. Second, we evaluate the feasibility of a non-wearable device in a free-living environment. The deployed device comprises a sensor mat with an integrated micro-bending multimode fibre. Raw sensor data were gathered from five senior participants living in a senior activity centre over a few to several weeks. We were able to analyse the participants' sleep quality using various sleep parameters deduced from the sensor mat. These parameters include the wake-up time, bedtime, the time in bed, nap time. Vital signs, namely heart rate, respiratory rate, and body movements, were also reported to detect abnormal sleep patterns. We have employed pre-and post-surveys reporting each volunteer's sleep hygiene to confirm the proposed system's outcomes for detecting the various sleep parameters. The results of the system were strongly correlated with the surveys for reporting each sleep parameter. Furthermore, the system proved to be highly effective in detecting irregular patterns that occurred during sleep.

AB  - Background: Conventional diet assessment approaches such as the 24-hour self-reported recall are burdensome, suffer from recall bias, and are inaccurate in estimating energy intake. Wearable sensor technology, coupled with advanced algorithms, is increasingly showing promise in its ability to capture behaviors that provide useful information for estimating calorie and macronutrient intake.
   Objective: This paper aimed to summarize current technological approaches to monitoring energy intake on the basis of expert opinion from a workshop panel and to make recommendations to advance technology and algorithms to improve estimation of energy expenditure.
   Methods: A 1-day invitational workshop sponsored by the National Science Foundation was held at Northwestern University. A total of 30 participants, including population health researchers, engineers, and intervention developers, from 6 universities and the National Institutes of Health participated in a panel discussing the state of evidence with regard to monitoring calorie intake and eating behaviors.
   Results: Calorie monitoring using technological approaches can be characterized into 3 domains . (1) image-based sensing (eg, wearable and smartphone-based cameras combined with machine learning algorithms); (2) eating action unit (EAU) sensors (eg, to measure feeding gesture and chewing rate); and (3) biochemical measures (eg, serum and plasma metabolite concentrations). We discussed how each domain functions, provided examples of promising solutions, and highlighted potential challenges and opportunities in each domain Image-based sensor research requires improved ground truth (context and known information about the foods), accurate food image segmentation and recognition algorithms, and reliable methods of estimating portion size. EAU based domain research is limited by the understanding of when their systems (device and inference algorithm) succeed and fail, need for privacy-protecting methods of capturing ground truth, and uncertainty in food categorization. Although an exciting novel technology, the challenges of biochemical sensing range from a lack of adaptability to environmental effects (eg, temperature change) and mechanical impact, instability of wearable sensor performance over time, and single-use design.
   Conclusions: Conventional approaches to calorie monitoring rely predominantly on self-reports. These approaches can gain contextual information from image-based and EAU-based domains that can map automatically captured food images to a food database and detect proxies that correlate with food volume and caloric intake. Although the continued development of advanced machine learning techniques will advance the accuracy of such wearables, biochemical sensing provides an electrochemical analysis of sweat using soft bioelectronics on human skin, enabling noninvasive measures of chemical compounds that provide insight into the digestive and endocrine systems. Future computing-based researchers should focus on reducing the burden of wearable sensors, aligning data across multiple devices, automating methods of data annotation, increasing rigor in studying system acceptability, increasing battery lifetime, and rigorously testing validity of the measure. Such research requires moving promising technological solutions from the controlled laboratory setting to the field.

AB  - Backgrounds: Nowadays, risks of Cognitive Impairment (CI) [highly suspected Alzheimer's disease (AD) in this study] threaten the quality of life for more older adults as the population ages. The emergence of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation-Electroencephalogram (TMS-EEG) enables noninvasive neurophysiological investi-gation of the human cortex, which might be potentially used for CI detection.Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore whether the spatiotemporal features of TMS Evoked Potentials (TEPs) could classify CI from healthy controls (HC).Methods: Twenty-one patients with CI and 22 HC underwent a single-pulse TMS-EEG stimulus in which the pulses were delivered to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left DLPFC). After preprocessing, seven regions of interest (ROIs) and two most reliable TEPs' components: N100 and P200 were selected. Next, seven simple and interpretable linear features of TEPs were extracted for each region, three common machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were used to detect CI. Meanwhile, data augmentation and voting strategy were used for a more robust model. Finally, the performance differences of features in classifiers and their contributions were investigated.Results: 1. In the time domain, the features of N100 had the best performance in the SVM classifier, with an accuracy of 88.37%. 2. In the aspect of spatiality, the features of the right frontal region and left parietal region had the best performance in the SVM classifier, with an accuracy of 83.72%. 3. The Local Mean Field Power (LMFP), Average Value (AVG), Latency and Amplitude contributed most in classification.Conclusions: The TEPs induced by TMS over the left DLPFC has significant differences spatially and temporally between CI and HC. Machine learning based on the spatiotemporal features of TEPs have the ability to separate the CI and HC which suggest that TEPs has potential as non-invasive biomarkers for CI diagnosis.

AB  - IntroductionThe prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) among older adults is increasing exponentially. The sequelae can be severe in older adults and interact with age-related conditions such as multimorbidity. Despite this, TBI research in older adults is sparse. Minder, an in-home monitoring system developed by the UK Dementia Research Institute Centre for Care Research and Technology, uses infrared sensors and a bed mat to passively collect sleep and activity data. Similar systems have been used to monitor the health of older adults living with dementia. We will assess the feasibility of using this system to study changes in the health status of older adults in the early period post-TBI.Methods and analysisThe study will recruit 15 inpatients (>60 years) with a moderate-severe TBI, who will have their daily activity and sleep patterns monitored using passive and wearable sensors over 6 months. Participants will report on their health during weekly calls, which will be used to validate sensor data. Physical, functional and cognitive assessments will be conducted across the duration of the study. Activity levels and sleep patterns derived from sensor data will be calculated and visualised using activity maps. Within-participant analysis will be performed to determine if participants are deviating from their own routines. We will apply machine learning approaches to activity and sleep data to assess whether the changes in these data can predict clinical events. Qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with participants, carers and clinical staff will assess acceptability and utility of the system.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval for this study has been granted by the London-Camberwell St Giles Research Ethics Committee (REC) (REC number: 17/LO/2066). Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals, presented at conferences and inform the design of a larger trial assessing recovery after TBI.

AB  - The internet of health care things enables a remote connection between health care professionals and patients wearing smart biosensors. Wearable smart devices are potentially affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, robust, lab-independent, and deliverable to the end user for point-of-care testing. The datasets derived from these devices are known as digital biomarkers. They represent a novel patient-centered approach to collecting longitudinal, context-derived health insights. Adding automated, analytical smartphone applications will enable their use in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. So far, digital biomarkers have been focused primarily on accelerometer data and heart rate due to well-established sensors originating from the consumer market. Novel emerging smart biosensors will detect biomarkers (or compounds) independent of a lab and noninvasively in sweat, saliva, and exhaled breath. These molecular digital biomarkers are a promising novel approach to reduce the burden from 2 major infectious diseases with urgent unmet needs: tuberculosis and infections with multidrug resistant pathogens. Active tuberculosis (aTbc) is one of the deadliest diseases from an infectious agent. However, a simple and reliable test for its detection is still missing. Furthermore, inappropriate antimicrobial use leads to the development of antimicrobial resistance, which is associated with high mortality and health care costs. From this perspective, we discuss the innovative approach of a noninvasive and lab-independent collection of novel biomarkers to detect aTbc, which at the same time may additionally serve as a scalable therapeutic drug monitoring approach for antibiotics. These molecular digital biomarkers are next-generation digital biomarkers and have the potential to shape the future of infectious diseases.

AB  - The extent of the peril associated with cancer can be perceived from the lack of treatment, ineffective early diagnosis techniques, and most importantly its fatality rate. Globally, cancer is the second leading cause of death and among over a hundred types of cancer; lung cancer is the second most common type of cancer as well as the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Anyhow, an accurate lung cancer diagnosis in a timely manner can elevate the likelihood of survival by a noticeable margin and medical imaging is a prevalent manner of cancer diagnosis since it is easily accessible to people around the globe. Nonetheless, this is not eminently efficacious considering human inspection of medical images can yield a high false positive rate. Inef-fective and inefficient diagnosis is a crucial reason for such a high mortality rate for this malady. However, the conspicuous advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence have stimulated the development of exceedingly precise diagnosis systems. The development and performance of these systems rely prominently on the data that is used to train these systems. A standard problem witnessed in publicly available medical image datasets is the severe imbalance of data between different classes. This grave imbalance of data can make a deep learning model biased towards the dominant class and unable to generalize. This study aims to present an end-to-end convolutional neural network that can accurately differentiate lung nodules from non-nodules and reduce the false positive rate to a bare minimum. To tackle the problem of data imbalance, we oversampled the data by transforming available images in the minority class. The average false positive rate in the proposed method is a mere 1.5 percent. However, the average false negative rate is 31.76 percent. The proposed neural network has 68.66 percent sensitivity and 98.42 percent specificity.

AB  - The Internet of Health things (IoHT) has numerous applications in healthcare by integrating health monitoring things like sensors and medical devices for remotely observe patient's records to provide smarter and intelligent medicare services. To avail best healthcare services to the users using the e-health applications, in this paper, we propose an IoT with cloud based clinical decision support system for the prediction and observance of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) with its level of severity. The proposed framework collects the patient data using the IoT devices attached to the user which will be stored in the cloud along with the related medical records from the UCI repository. Furthermore, we employ a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier for the prediction of CKD and its level of severity. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based feature selection method is also used to improve the performance of DNN classifier. The proposed model is validated by employing the benchmark CKD dataset. Different classifiers are employed to compare the performance of the proposed model under several classification measures. The proposed DNN classifier alone predicts CKD with an accuracy of 98.25% and is further enhanced to 99.25 by PSO-FS method. At the same time, the improved classification performance is verified with higher values of 98.03 specificity, 99.25 accuracy, 99.39 F-score and 98.40 kappa value respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For safe and effective robot-aided gait training, it is essential to incorporate the knowledge and expertise of physical therapists. Toward this goal, we directly learn from physical therapists' demonstrations of manual gait assistance in stroke rehabilitation. Lower-limb kinematics of patients and assistive force applied by therapists to the patient's leg are measured using a wearable sensing system which includes a custom-made force sensing array. The collected data is then used to characterize a therapist's strategies in response to unique gait behaviors found within a patient's gait. Preliminary analysis shows that knee extension and weight-shifting are the most important features that shape a therapist's assistance strategies. These key features are then integrated into a virtual impedance model to predict the therapist's assistive torque. This model benefits from a goal-directed attractor and representative features that allow intuitive characterization and estimation of a therapist's assistance strategies. The resulting model is able to accurately capture high-level therapist behaviors over the course of a full training session (r2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.23Nm) while still explaining some of the more nuanced behaviors contained in individual strides (r2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.61Nm). This work provides a new approach to control wearable robotics in the sense of directly encoding the decision-making process of physical therapists into a safe human-robot interaction framework for gait rehabilitation.

AB  - Falls pose a major threat to the well-being and quality of life of older people. Falls can result in fractures and other injuries, disability and fear and can trigger a decline in physical function and loss of autonomy. This article synthesises recent published findings on fall risk and mobility assessments and fall prevention interventions and considers how this field of research may evolve in the future. Fall risk topics include the utility of remote monitoring using wearable sensors and recent work investigating brain activation and gait adaptability. New approaches for exercise for fall prevention including dual-task training, cognitive-motor training with exergames and reactive step training are discussed. Additional fall prevention strategies considered include the prevention of falls in older people with dementia and Parkinson's disease, drugs for fall prevention and safe flooring for preventing fall-related injuries. The review discusses how these new initiatives and technologies have potential for effective fall prevention and improved quality of life. It concludes by emphasising the need for a continued focus on translation of evidence into practice including robust effectiveness evaluations of so that resources can be appropriately targeted into the future.

AB  - With the rapid development of information technology, the conception of smart healthcare has progressively come to the fore. Smart healthcare utilizes next-generation technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and cloud computing to transform intelligently the existing medical system-making it more efficient, more reliable, and personalized. In this work, skin data are collected using dedicated hardware from mobile health units-working as nodes. The collected samples are uploaded to the cloud for further processing using a novel multi-modal information fusion framework, which performs skin lesion segmentation, followed by classification. The proposed framework has two main functional blocks: Segmentation and classification. In each block, we have a performance booster, which works on the principle of information fusion. For lesion segmentation, a hybrid framework is proposed, which utilizes the complementary strengths of two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to generate the segmented images. The resultant binary images are later fused using joint probability distribution and marginal distribution function. For lesion classification, a 30-layered CNN architecture is designed, which is trained on the HAM10000 dataset. A novel summation discriminant correlation analysis technique is used to fuse the extracted features from two fully connected layers. To avoid feature redundancy, a feature selection method "Regular Falsi" is developed, which down samples the extracted features into the lower dimensions. The selected features are finally classified using an extreme learning machine classifier. Five skin benchmark datasets (ISBI2016, ISIC2017, ISBI2018, ISIC2019, and HAM10000) are used to evaluate both segmentation and classification frameworks using average accuracy, false-negative rate, sensitivity, and computational time, whose results are impressive compared to state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECG) provide an effective, non-invasive approach for clinical diagnosis and monitoring treatment in patients with cardiac diseases including the most common cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation (AF). Portable ECG recording devices including Apple Watch and Kardia devices have been developed for AF detection. However, the efficacy of these smart devices has not been fully validated. We aimed to develop an open-source deep learning framework for automatic AF detection using the largest publicly available single-lead ECG dataset through a mobile Kardia device enhanced with style transfer-driven data augmentation. We developed and validated a 37-layer convolutional recurrent network (CRN) using 5,834 single-lead ECGs with a mean length of 30 seconds from the 2017 PhysioNet Challenge to automatically detect sinus rhythm and AF. To address the challenge of a lack of a large number of AF samples, we proposed a novel style transfer generator that fuses patient-specific clinical ECGs and mathematically modelled ECG features to synthesize realistic ECGs by five-fold. The differences between synthesized and clinical ECGs were analyzed by studying their average ECG morphologies and frequency distributions. Our results indicated the style transfer-driven data augmentation was not classifier-dependent. Validation on 2,917 clinical ECGs showed an F1 score of 96.4%, with the generated ECGs contributing to a 3% improvement in AF detection for the Kardia event recorder. By developing and evaluating our approach on an open-source ECG dataset, we have demonstrated that our framework is both robust and verifiable, and potentially can be used in portable devices for effective AF classification.

AB  - The mechanical signals of the laryngeal vocal organ have not been well utilized by human speech processing technology. The authors develop a prototype of a wearable artificial throat that can sense speech- and vocalization-related actions. The results suggest a new technological pathway for speech recognition and interaction systems.
   Researchers have recently been pursuing technologies for universal speech recognition and interaction that can work well with subtle sounds or noisy environments. Multichannel acoustic sensors can improve the accuracy of recognition of sound but lead to large devices that cannot be worn. To solve this problem, we propose a graphene-based intelligent, wearable artificial throat (AT) that is sensitive to human speech and vocalization-related motions. Its perception of the mixed modalities of acoustic signals and mechanical motions enables the AT to acquire signals with a low fundamental frequency while remaining noise resistant. The experimental results showed that the mixed-modality AT can detect basic speech elements (phonemes, tones and words) with an average accuracy of 99.05%. We further demonstrated its interactive applications for speech recognition and voice reproduction for the vocally disabled. It was able to recognize everyday words vaguely spoken by a patient with laryngectomy with an accuracy of over 90% through an ensemble AI model. The recognized content was synthesized into speech and played on the AT to rehabilitate the capability of the patient for vocalization. Its feasible fabrication process, stable performance, resistance to noise and integrated vocalization make the AT a promising tool for next-generation speech recognition and interaction systems.

AB  - Flexible piezoresistive sensors, which attract considerable research interest, have been extensively investigated by many efforts from material and structural methodologies. However, practical applications for physiological assessment, apart from the monitoring of joint motion and recording of pulse, have been rarely reported. In this work, vertical graphene (VG) nanowalls were synthesized, characterized, and adopted to fabricate flexible strain sensors. Routine measurements, such as strain responsion, were exerted. Then, the radial and carotid pulses and the respiratory rate of subjects were collected by these flexible piezoresistive sensors to evaluate the pulse rate, the rhythm of pulse, and the respiratory rate for risk assessment of cardiac bradycardia, arrhythmias, arrest, and artery stiffening. Furthermore, a wearable circuit was also designed and fabricated in this work to integrate with the flexible sensor for portable physiological monitoring. The convenient noninvasive platform makes it extremely suitable for wide applications at community levels, which help to raise and sustain awareness of the importance of vital signs.

AB  - Background: Bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with premature death and ischemic heart disease is the main cause of excess mortality. Heart rate variability (HRV) predicts mortality in patients with or without cardiovascular disease. While several studies have analyzed the association between HRV and BD, none has analyzed the association of HRV with illness burden in BD.
   Methods: 53 participants with BD I and II used a wearable device to assess the association between HRV and factors characterizing illness burden, including illness duration, number and type of previous episode(s), duration of the most severe episode, history of suicide attempts or psychotic symptoms during episodes, and comorbid psychiatric disorders. We ran unadjusted models and models controlling statistically for age, sex, pharmacotherapy, baseline functional cardiovascular capacity, BMI, years of education, and marital status. We also explored the association between HRV and an overall illness burden index (IBI) integrating all these factors using a weighted geometric mean.
   Results: Adjusted and unadjusted models had similar results. Longer illness duration, higher number of depressive episodes, longer duration of most severe manic/hypomanic episode, co-morbid anxiety disorders, and family history of suicide were associated with reduced HRV, as was bipolar depression severity in the participants experiencing a depressive episode. Finally, a higher IBI score was associated with lower HRV.
   Conclusions: High illness burden is associated with reduced HRV in BD. While the IBI needs to be validated in a larger sample, it may provide an overall measure that captures illness burden in BD.

AB  - Objective Gait is a sensitive marker for functional declines commonly seen in patients treated for advanced cancer. We tested the effect of a combined exercise and nutrition programme on gait parameters of advanced-stage cancer patients using a novel wearable gait analysis system. Methods Eighty patients were allocated to a control group with nutritional support or to an intervention group additionally receiving whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) training (2x/week). At baseline and after 12 weeks, physical function was assessed by a biosensor-based gait analysis during a six-minute walk test, a 30-s sit-to-stand test, a hand grip strength test, the Karnofsky Index and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and inflammation by blood analysis. Results Final analysis included 41 patients (56.1% male; 60.0 +/- 13.0 years). After 12 weeks, the WB-EMS group showed higher stride length, gait velocity (p < .05), six-minute walking distance (p < .01), bodyweight and skeletal muscle mass, and emotional functioning (p < .05) compared with controls. Correlations between changes in gait and in body composition, physical function and inflammation were detected. Conclusion Whole-body electromyostimulation combined with nutrition may help to improve gait and functional status of cancer patients. Sensor-based mobile gait analysis objectively reflects patients' physical status and could support treatment decisions.

AB  - A fully automated and accurate assay of rare cell phenotypes in densely-packed fluorescently-labeled liquid biopsy images remains elusive.
   Methods: Employing a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm that combines traditional rule-based morphological manipulations with modern statistical machine learning, we deployed a next generation software, ALICE (Automated Liquid Biopsy Cell Enumerator) to identify and enumerate minute amounts of tumor cell phenotypes bestrewed in massive populations of leukocytes. As a code designed for futurity, ALICE is armed with internet of things (IOT) connectivity to promote pedagogy and continuing education and also, an advanced cybersecurity system to safeguard against digital attacks from malicious data tampering.
   Results: By combining robust principal component analysis, random forest classifier and cubic support vector machine, ALICE was able to detect synthetic, anomalous and tampered input images with an average recall and precision of 0.840 and 0.752, respectively. In terms of phenotyping enumeration, ALICE was able to enumerate various circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotypes with a reliability ranging from 0.725 (substantial agreement) to 0.961 (almost perfect) as compared to human analysts. Further, two subpopulations of circulating hybrid cells (CHCs) were serendipitously discovered and labeled as CHC-1 (DAP1+/CD45+/E-cadherin+/vimentin-) and CHC-2 (DAP1+ /CD45+/E-cadherin+/vimentin+) in the peripheral blood of pancreatic cancer patients. CHC-1 was found to correlate with nodal staging and was able to classify lymph node metastasis with a sensitivity of 0.615 (95% CI: 0.374-0.898) and specificity of 1.000 (95% CI: 1.000-1.000).
   Conclusion: This study presented a machine-learning-augmented rule-based hybrid AI algorithm with enhanced cybersecurity and connectivity for the automatic and flexibly-adapting enumeration of cellular liquid biopsies. ALICE has the potential to be used in a clinical setting for an accurate and reliable enumeration of CTC phenotypes.

AB  - Background and Purpose- Limited evidence exists on the effectiveness and safety of warfarin and all 4 available non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) from current clinical practice in the Asian population with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of warfarin and 4 NOACs.
   Methods- We studied a retrospective nonrandomized observational cohort of oral anticoagulant naive nonvalvular patients with atrial fibrillation treated with warfarin or NOACs (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, or edoxaban) from January 2015 to December 2017, based on the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment database. For the comparisons, warfarin to 4 NOACs and NOAC to NOAC comparison cohorts were balanced using the inverse probability of treatment weighting. Ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, major bleeding, and a composite clinical outcome were evaluated.
   Results- A total of 116804 patients were included (25420 with warfarin, 35965 with rivaroxaban, 17745 with dabigatran, 22177 with apixaban, and 15496 with edoxaban). Compared with warfarin, all NOACs were associated with lower risks of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, major bleeding, and composite outcome. Apixaban and edoxaban showed a lower rate of ischemic stroke compared with rivaroxaban and dabigatran. Apixaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban had a lower rate of gastrointestinal bleeding and major bleeding compared with rivaroxaban. The composite clinical outcome was nonsignificantly different for apixaban versus edoxaban.
   Conclusions- In this large contemporary nonrandomized Asian cohort, all 4 NOACs were associated with lower rates of ischemic stroke and major bleeding compared with warfarin. Differences in clinical outcomes between NOACs may give useful guidance for physicians to choose drugs to fit their particular patient clinical profile.

AB  - Assessment of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) is essential for the diagnosis and staging of dementia. However, current IADL assessments are subjective and cannot be administered remotely. We proposed a smart-home design, called IADLSys, for remote monitoring of IADL. IADLSys consists of three major components: (1) wireless physical tags (pTAG) attached to objects of interest, (2) a pendant-sensor to monitor physical activities and detect interaction with pTAGs, and (3) an interactive tablet as a gateway to transfer data to a secured cloud. Four studies, including an exploratory clinical study with five older adults with clinically confirmed cognitive impairment, who used IADLSys for 24 h/7 days, were performed to confirm IADLSys feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and validity of detecting IADLs of interest and physical activity. Exploratory tests in two cases with severe and mild cognitive impairment, respectively, revealed that a case with severe cognitive impairment either overestimated or underestimated the frequency of performed IADLs, whereas self-reporting and objective IADL were comparable for the case with mild cognitive impairment. This feasibility and acceptability study may pave the way to implement the smart-home concept to remotely monitor IADL, which in turn may assist in providing personalized support to people with cognitive impairment, while tracking the decline in both physical and cognitive function.

AB  - A new self-powered wearable body-detecting/brain-stimulating system for monitoring and restraining epilepsy has been fabricated. The system can monitor body motion in real time and transmit the stimulus signals to brain for restraining the epileptic seizures. The system is composed of energy harvesting module, the body motion detection sensor, the data processing center, and neural stimulator. An arch-shaped device made of piezoelectric ceramic transducer (lead zirconate titanate; PZT) as energy harvesting module can convert the mechanical energy generated by body movement into electricity power. The motion detection sensor is made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) doped with zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures, which can detect the tiny movements of the human body and transmit sensing signals to the data processing center. The data processing center can determine the epileptic seizure and generate neural stimulating signals. By stimulating the dentate gyrus/hilus brain region of mice, the total duration of epileptic seizures in mice is significantly reduced by 40-50%. This new self-powered strategy demonstrates the potential of brain-machine-interface system for personalized treatment of brain disease.

AB  - Background. Cardiovascular diseases have been always the most common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Health monitoring of high-risk and suspected patients is essential. Currently, invasive coronary angiography is still the most direct and accurate method of determining the severity of coronary artery lesions, but it may not be the optimal clinical choice for suspected patients who had clinical symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD) such as chest pain but no coronary artery lesion. Modern medical research indicates that radial pulse waves contain substantial pathophysiologic information about the cardiovascular and circulation systems; therefore, analysis of these waves could be a noninvasive technique for assessing cardiovascular disease. Objective. The objective of this study was to analyze the radial pulse wave to construct models for assessing the extent of coronary artery lesions based on pulse features and investigate the latent value of noninvasive detection technology based on pulse wave in the evaluation of cardiovascular disease, so as to promote the development of wearable devices and mobile medicine. Method. This study included 529 patients suspected of CHD who had undergone coronary angiography. Patients were sorted into a control group with no lesions, a 1 or 2 lesion group, and a multiple (3 or more) lesion group as determined by coronary angiography. The linear time-domain features and the nonlinear multiscale entropy features of their radial pulse wave signals were compared, and these features were used to construct models for identifying the range of coronary artery lesions using the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), and random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms. The average precision of these algorithms was then compared. Results. (1) Compared with the control group, the group with 1 or 2 lesions had increases in their radial pulse wave time-domain features H2/H1, H3/H1, and W2 (P<0.05), whereas the group with multiple lesions had decreases in MSE1, MSE2, MSE3, MSE4, and MSE5 (P<0.05). (2) Compared with the 1 or 2 lesion group, the multiple lesion group had increases in T1/T (P<0.05) and decreases in T and W1 (P<0.05). (3) The RF model for identifying numbers of coronary artery lesions had a higher average precision than the models built with KNN or DT. Furthermore, average precision of the model was highest (80.98%) if both time-domain features and multiscale entropy features of radial pulse signals were used to construct the model. Conclusion. Pulse wave signal can identify the range of coronary artery lesions with acceptable accuracy; this result is promising valuable for assessing the severity of coronary artery lesions. The technique could be used to development of mobile medical treatments or remote home monitoring systems for patients suspected or those at high risk of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.

AB  - Background Acute infections can cause an individual to have an elevated resting heart rate (RHR) and change their routine daily activities due to the physiological response to the inflammatory insult. Consequently, we aimed to evaluate if population trends of seasonal respiratory infections, such as influenza, could be identified through wearable sensors that collect RHR and sleep data.
   Methods We obtained de-identified sensor data from 200 000 individuals who used a Fitbit wearable device from March 1, 2016, to March 1, 2018, in the USA. We included users who wore a Fitbit for at least 60 days and used the same wearable throughout the entire period, and focused on the top five states with the most Fitbit users in the dataset: California, Texas, New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Inclusion criteria included having a self-reported birth year between 1930 and 2004, height greater than 1 m, and weight greater than 20 kg. We excluded daily measurements with missing RHR, missing wear time, and wear time less than 1000 min per day. We compared sensor data with weekly estimates of influenza-like illness (ILI) rates at the state level, as reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), by identifying weeks in which Fitbit users displayed elevated RHRs and increased sleep levels. For each state, we modelled ILI case counts with a negative binomial model that included 3-week lagged CDC ILI rate data (null model) and the proportion of weekly Fitbit users with elevated RHR and increased sleep duration above a specified threshold (full model). We also evaluated weekly change in ILI rate by linear regression using change in proportion of elevated Fitbit data. Pearson correlation was used to compare predicted versus CDC reported ILI rates.
   Findings We identified 47 249 users in the top five states who wore a Fitbit consistently during the study period, including more than 13.3 million total RHR and sleep measures. We found the Fitbit data significantly improved ILI predictions in all five states, with an average increase in Pearson correlation of 0.12 (SD 0.07) over baseline models, corresponding to an improvement of 6.3-32.9%. Correlations of the final models with the CDC ILI rates ranged from 0.84 to 0.97. Week-to-week changes in the proportion of Fitbit users with abnormal data were associated with week-to-week changes in ILI rates in most cases.
   Interpretation Activity and physiological trackers are increasingly used in the USA and globally to monitor individual health. By accessing these data, it could be possible to improve real-time and geographically refined influenza surveillance. This information could be vital to enact timely outbreak response measures to prevent further transmission of influenza cases during outbreaks. Copyright (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - An electrochemical sensor based on a conformation-changing aptamer is reported to detect soluble KIT, a cancer biomarker, in human serum. The sensor was fabricated with a ferrocene-labeled aptamer (K-d < 5 nM) conjugated to a gold electrode. Quantitative KIT detection was achieved using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV). EIS was used to optimize experimental parameters such as the aptamer-to-spacer ratio, aptamer immobilization time, pH, and KIT incubation time, and the sensor surface was characterized using voltammetry. The assay specificity was demonstrated using interfering species and exhibited high specificity toward the target protein. The aptasensor showed a wide dynamic range, 10 pg/mL-100 ng/mL in buffer, with a 1.15 pg/mL limit of detection. The sensor also has a linear response to KIT spiked in human serum and successfully detected KIT in cancer-cell-conditioned media. The proposed aptasensor has applications as a continuous or intermittent approach for cancer therapy monitoring and diagnostics (theranostics).

AB  - We herein introduce a lightweight and zero-power smart face mask, capable of wirelessly monitoring coughs in real time and identifying proper mask wearing in public places during a pandemic. The smart face mask relies on the compact, battery-free radio frequency (RF) harmonic transponder, which is attached to the inner layer of the mask for detecting its separation from the face. Specifically, the RF transponder composed of miniature antennas and passive frequency multiplier is made of spray-printed silver nanowires (AgNWs) coated with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PE-DOT:PSS) passivation layer and the recently discovered multiscale porous polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) substrate. Unlike conventional on-chip or on-board wireless sensors, the SEBS-AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS-based RF transponder is lightweight, stretchable, breathable, and comfortable. In addition, this wireless device has excellent resilience and robustness in long-term and repeated usages (i.e., repeated placement and removal of the soft transponder on the mask). We foresee that this wireless smart face mask, providing simultaneous cough and mask-wearing monitoring, may mitigate virus-transmissive events by tracking the potential contagious person and identifying mask-wearing conditions. Moreover, the ability to wirelessly assess cough frequencies may improve diagnosis accuracy for dealing with several diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

AB  - For a single hemodialysis session nearly 500 L of water are consumed for obtaining pyrogen-free dialysis fluid. However, many efforts are required to avoid biofilm formation in the system and risk of contamination can persist. Water scarcity and inadequate water purification facilities worsen contamination risk in developing countries. Here, we investigated the application of an activated carbon (AC)/polyethersulfone/polyvinylpyrrolidone mixed matrix membrane (MMM) for achieving for the first time endotoxin-free dialysate and high removal of uremic toxins from human plasma with a single membrane. The MMM, thanks to sorbent AC, can remove approximately 10 times more endotoxins from dialysis fluid compared to commercial fibers. Pyrogens transport through the MMM was investigated analyzing inflammation in THP-1 monocytes incubated with samples from the dialysis circuit, revealing safety-barrier properties of the MMM. Importantly, endotoxins from dialysate and protein-bound toxins from human plasma can be removed simultaneously without compromising AC adsorption capacity. We estimated that only 0.15 m(2) of MMM is needed to totally remove the daily production of the protein-bound toxins indoxyl sulfate and hippuric acid and to completely remove endotoxins in a wearable artificial kidney (WAK) device. Our results could open up new possibilities for dialysis therapy with low water consumption including WAK and where purity and scarcity of water are limiting factors for hemodialysis treatment.
   Statement of Significance
   Hemodialysis is a life-sustaining extracorporeal treatment for renal disease, however the production of pyrogen-free dialysate is very costly and water demanding. Biofilm formation in the system worsens bacteria contamination risk. Pyrogens could be transferred into the patients' blood and trigger inflammation. Here, we show for the first time that a mixed matrix membrane composed of polyethersulfone/polyvinyl pyrrolidone and activated carbon can achieve simultaneous complete removal of endotoxins from dialysate and high removal of uremic toxins from human plasma without compromising activated carbon adsorption capacity. The mixed matrix membrane could find future applications for simultaneous blood purification and dialysate depyrogenation thus lowering water consumption as for wearable artificial kidney devices and where purity and scarcity of water hamper hemodialysis treatment.

AB  - In the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), medical devices and applications are linked via networking to create a healthcare data framework. In the IoMT environment, a healthcare tracking framework is required to detect health abnormalities on a proper basis and prescribe treatments based on the data obtained from wearable sensors. In the IoMT platform, an Electrocardiogram (ECG) helps to analyze the electrical function of the heart in a simplified and comfortable way. ECG monitoring is used to diagnose heart diseases, such as arrhythmias. ECG signal analysis automatically detect and classify life-threatening arrhythmias associated with various cardiac situations. Arrhythmia diagnosis and classification can be misinterpreted when ECG signals are corrupted with different noises. To overcome such interpretation Variance Approximation and Probabilistic Decomposition Noise Removal method (VA-PDNR) has been developed to denoise the ECG signal for arrhythmia detection and classification. VA has been used to reduce high-frequency noise in ECG signals by controlling the operational variables to minimize noise variation. Furthermore, PDNR breaks up the power line interference into different mode parameters and remove noise by utilizing Linear Quadratic Estimation. The dimension-reduction analysis aims to remove redundancies and verify characteristic textural characteristics. All such hybrid features are blended and fed to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Arrhythmia classification. Improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to 34.55 dB, the accuracy to 98.99 per cent, and the mean square error rate. VA-PDNR method is estimated using ECG signals collected from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset and improves Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) to 34.55 dB, accuracy to 98.99%, and lesser mean square error (MSE) rate.

AB  - Remote health monitoring applications with the advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have changed traditional healthcare services. Additionally, in terms of personalized healthcare and disease prevention services, these depend primarily on the strategy used to derive knowledge from the analysis of lifestyle factors and activities. Through the use of intelligent data retrieval and classification models, it is possible to study disease, or even predict any abnormal health conditions. To predict such abnormality, the Convolutional neural network (CNN) model is used, which can detect the knowledge related to disease prediction accurately from unstructured medical health records. However, CNN uses a large amount of memory if it uses a fully connected network structure. Moreover, the increase in the number of layers can lead to an increase in the complexity analysis of the model. Therefore, to overcome these limitations of the CNN-model, we propose a CNN-regular target detection and recognition model based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and regular pattern behavior, where the term & x201C;regular & x201D; denotes objects that generally appear in similar contexts and have structures with low variability. In this framework, we develop a CNN-regular pattern discovery model for data classification. First, the most important health-related factors are selected in the first hidden layer, then in the second layer, a correlation coefficient analysis is conducted to classify the positively and negatively correlated health factors. Moreover, regular patterns & x2019; behaviors are discovered through mining the regular pattern occurrence among the classified health factors. The output of the model is subdivided into regular-correlated parameters related to obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Two distinct datasets are adopted to mitigate the effects of the CNN-regular knowledge discovery model. The experimental results show that the proposed model has better accuracy, and low computational load, compared with three different machine learning techniques methods.

AB  - Alternative medicine techniques such as music therapy have been a recent interest of medical practitioners and researchers. Significant clinical evidence suggests that music has a positive influence over pain, stress and anxiety for the patients of cancer, pre and post surgery, insomnia, child birth, end of life care, etc. Similarly, the technologies of Internet of Things (IoT), Body Area Networks (BAN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been playing a vital role to improve the health and safety of the population through offering continuous remote monitoring facilities and immediate medical response. In this article, we propose a novel ANN enabled IoT architecture to integrate music therapy with BAN and ANN for providing immediate assistance to patients by automating the process of music therapy. The proposed architecture comprises of monitoring the body parameters of patients using BAN, categorizing the disease using ANN and playing music of the most appropriate type over the patient's handheld device, when required. In addition, the ANN will also exploit Music Analytics such as the type and duration of music played and its impact over patient's body parameters to iteratively improve the process of automated music therapy. We detail development of a prototype Android app which builds a playlist and plays music according to the emotional state of the user, in real time. Data for pulse rate, blood pressure and breath rate has been generated using Node-Red, and ANN has been created using Google Colaboratory (Colab). MQTT broker has been used to send generated data to Android device. The ANN uses binary and categorical cross-entropy loss functions, Adam optimiser and ReLU activation function to predict the mood of patient and suggest the most appropriate type of music.

AB  - Sleep is the most important aspect of healthy and active living. The right amount of sleep at the right time helps an individual to protect his or her physical, mental, and cognitive health and maintain his or her quality of life. The most durative of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL), sleep has a major synergic influence on a person's fuctional, behavioral, and cognitive health. A deep understanding of sleep behavior and its relationship with its physiological signals, and contexts (such as eye or body movements), is necessary to design and develop a robust intelligent sleep monitoring system. In this article, we propose an intelligent algorithm to detect the microscopic states of sleep that fundamentally constitute the components of good and bad sleeping behaviors and thus help shape the formative assessment of sleep quality. Our initial analysis includes the investigation of several classification techniques to identify and correlate the relationship of microscopic sleep states with overall sleep behavior. Subsequently, we also propose an online algorithm based on change point detection to process and classify the microscopic sleep states. We also develop a lightweight version of the proposed algorithm for real-time sleep monitoring, recognition, and assessment at scale. For a larger deployment of our proposed model across a community of individuals, we propose an active-learning-based methodology to reduce the effort of ground-truth data collection and labeling. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms on real data traces and demonstrate the efficacy of our models for detecting and assessing the fine-grained sleep states beyond an individual.

AB  - Objective: Falls often occur in patients with diabetic neuropathy due to biomechanical alternation. The implication of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) on gait and balance remains poorly understood.
   Methods: A total of 11 dynamic gait, balance and electrophysiological parameters were evaluated in 176 participants. The biomechanical parameters were compared between groups.
   Results: Stride length and stride velocity were significantly lower in all subgroups of DPN compared with healthy subjects (p<0.05). Stance phase and double support phase were significantly higher, but swing phase were significantly lower across all subgroups of DPN than healthy subjects (p<0.05). Under eyes-open standing, the ML and AP range parameters of CoM sway, ankle sway and hip sway, CoM sway index, ankle swing index in both subclinical and confirmed DPN patients were all significantly higher compared to healthy subjects (p<0.05). Under eyes-closed standing, AP range parameters of CoM sway in subclinical DPN and confirmed DPN patients were significantly higher than healthy subjects (p<0.05). The hip sway areas in diabetics were significantly higher compared to healthy subjects (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: The abnormal biomechanical parameters existed in the early stages of patients with DPN. The static balance under eyes-open and eye-closed condition is maintained by ankle joint compensation strategy and hip joint protection strategy. An early evaluation and better risk management is essential for diabetic patients with a history of more than 5 years even without DPN clinical symptoms and signs.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly reported arrhythmia and, if undiagnosed or untreated, may lead to thromboembolic events. It is therefore desirable to provide screening to patients in order to detect atrial arrhythmias. Specific mobile apps and accessory devices, such as smartphones and smartwatches, may play a significant role in monitoring heart rhythm in populations at high risk of arrhythmia. These apps are becoming increasingly common among patients and professionals as a part of mobile health. The rapid development of mobile health solutions may revolutionize approaches to arrhythmia screening. In this viewpoint paper, we assess the availability of smartphone and smartwatch apps and evaluate their efficacy for monitoring heart rhythm and arrhythmia detection. The findings obtained so far suggest they are on the right track to improving the efficacy of early detection of atrial fibrillation, thus lowering the risk of stroke and reducing the economic burden placed on public health.

AB  - Cerebral venous outflow is investigated in the diagnosis of heart failure through the monitoring of jugular venous pulse, an indicator to assess cardiovascular diseases. The jugular venous pulse is a weak signal stemming from the lying internal jugular vein and often invasive methodologies requiring surgery are mandatory to detect it. Jugular venous pulse can also be extrapolated via the ultrasound technique, but it requires a qualified healthcare operator to perform the examination. In this work, a wireless, user-friendly, wearable device for plethysmography is developed to investigate the possibility of monitoring the jugular venous pulse non-invasively. The proposed device can monitor the jugular venous pulse and the electrocardiogram synchronously. To study the feasibility of using the proposed device to detect physiological variables, several measurements were carried out on healthy subjects by considering three different postures: supine, sitting, and upright. Data acquired in the experiment were properly filtered to highlight the cardiac oscillation and remove the breathing contribution, which causes a considerable shift in the amplitude of signals. To evaluate the proper functioning of the wearable device for plethysmography, a comparison with the ultrasound technique was carried out. As a satisfactory result, the acquired signals resemble the typical jugular venous pulse waveforms found in literature.

AB  - Objectives: This paper introduces a novel method for the detection and classification of aortic stenosis (AS) using the time-frequency features of chest cardio-mechanical signals collected from wearable sensors, namely seismo-cardiogram (SCG) and gyro-cardiogram (GCG) signals. Such a method could potentially monitor high-risk patients out of the clinic. Methods: Experimental measurements were collected from twenty patients with AS and twenty healthy subjects. Firstly, a digital signal processing framework is proposed to extract time-frequency features. The features are then selected via the analysis of variance test. Different combinations of features are evaluated using the decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network methods. Two classification tasks are conducted. The first task is a binary classification between normal subjects and AS patients. The second task is a multi-class classification of AS patients with co-existing valvular heart diseases. Results: In the binary classification task, the average accuracies achieved are 96.25% from decision tree, 97.43% from random forest, and 95.56% from neural network. The best performance is from combined SCG and GCG features with random forest classifier. In the multi-class classification, the best performance is 92.99% using the random forest classifier and SCG features. Conclusion: The results suggest that the solution could be a feasible method for classifying aortic stenosis, both in the binary and multi-class tasks. It also indicates that most of the important time-frequency features are below 11 Hz.Significance: The proposed method shows great potential to provide continuous monitoring of valvular heart diseases to prevent patients from sudden critical cardiac situations.

AB  - Diabetes is a pathological condition that requires the continuous monitoring of glucose level in the blood. Its control has been tremendously improved by the application of point-of-care devices. Conventional enzyme-based sensors with electrochemical and optical transduction systems can successfully measure the glucose concentration in human blood, but they suffer from the low stability of the enzyme. Non-enzymatic wearable electrochemical and optical sensors, with low-cost, high stability, point-of-care testing and online monitoring of glucose levels in biological fluids, have recently been developed and can help to manage and control diabetes worldwide. Advances in nanoscience and nanotechnology have enabled the development of novel nanomaterials that can be implemented for the use in enzyme-free systems to detect glucose. This review summarizes recent developments of enzyme-free electrochemical and optical glucose sensors, as well as their respective wearable and commercially available devices, capable of detecting glucose at physiological pH conditions without the need to pretreat the biological fluids. Additionally, the evolution of electrochemical glucose sensor technology and a couple of widely used optical detection systems along with the glucose detection mechanism is also discussed. Finally, this review addresses limitations and challenges of current non-enzymatic electrochemical, optical, and wearable glucose sensor technologies and highlights opportunities for future research directions.

AB  - Situated at the intersection of technology and medicine, the Internet of Things (IoT) holds the promise of addressing some of healthcare's most pressing challenges, from medical error, to chronic drug shortages, to overburdened hospital systems, to dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite considerable recent technological advances, the pace of successful implementation of promising IoT healthcare initiatives has been slow. To inspire more productive collaboration, we present here a simple-but surprisingly underrated-problem-oriented approach to developing healthcare technologies. To further assist in this effort, we reviewed the various commercial, regulatory, social/cultural, and technological factors in the development of the IoT. We propose that fog computing-a technological paradigm wherein the burden of computing is shifted from a centralized cloud server closer to the data source-offers the greatest promise for building a robust and scalable healthcare IoT ecosystem. To this end, we explore the key enabling technologies that underpin the fog architecture, from the sensing layer all the way up to the cloud. It is our hope that ongoing advances in sensing, communications, cryptography, storage, machine learning, and artificial intelligence will be leveraged in meaningful ways to generate unprecedented medical intelligence and thus drive improvements in the health of many people.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) emerges with the vision of the Wireless Body Sensor Network (WBSN) to improve the health mon-itoring systems and has an enormous impact on the healthcare system for recognizing the levels of risk/severity factors (premature diagnosis, treatment, and supervision of chronic disease i.e., cancer) via wearable/electronic health sensor i.e., wireless endoscopic capsule. However, AI-assisted endoscopy plays a very significant role in the detection of gastric cancer. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used to diagnose gastric cancer based on various feature extraction models, consequently, limiting the identification and categorization performance in terms of cancerous stages and grades associated with each type of gastric cancer. This paper proposed an optimized AI-based approach to diagnose and assess the risk factor of gastric cancer based on its type, stage, and grade in the endoscopic images for smart healthcare applications. The proposed method is categorized into five phases such as image pre-processing, Four-Dimensional (4D) image conversion, image segmentation, K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) classification, and multi -grading and staging of image intensities. Moreover, the performance of the proposed method has experimented on two different datasets consisting of color and black and white endoscopic images. The simulation results verified that the proposed approach is capable of perceiving gastric cancer with 88.09% sensitivity, 95.77% specificity, and 96.55% overall accuracy respectively.

AB  - Background The impact of using direct-to-consumer wearable devices as a means to timely detect atrial fibrillation (AF) and to improve clinical outcomes is unknown.Methods Heartline is a pragmatic, randomized, and decentralized application-based trial of US participants aged >65 years. Two randomized cohorts include adults with possession of an iPhone and without a history of AF and those with a diagnosis of AF taking a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for >30 days. Participants within each cohort are randomized (3:1) to either a core digital engagement program (CDEP) via iPhone application (Heartline application) and an Apple Watch (Apple Watch Group) or CDEP alone (iPhone-only Group). The Apple Watch Group has the watch irregular rhythm notification (IRN) feature enabled and access to the ECG application on the Apple Watch. If an IRN notification is issued for suspected AF then the study application instructs participants in the Apple Watch Group to seek medical care. All participants were "watch-naive" at time of enrollment and have an option to either buy or loan an Apple Watch as part of this study. The primary end point is time from randomization to clinical diagnosis of AF, with confirmation by health care claims. Key secondary endpoint are claims-based incidence of a 6-component composite cardiovascular/systemic embolism/mortality event, DOAC medication use and adherence, costs/health resource utilization, and frequency of hospitalizations for bleeding. All study assessments, including patient-reported outcomes, are conducted through the study application. The target study enrollment is approximately 28,000 participants in total; at time of manuscript submission, a total of 26,485 participants have been enrolled into the study.Conclusion The Heartline Study will assess if an Apple Watch with the IRN and ECG application, along with application-facilitated digital health engagement modules, improves time to AF diagnosis and cardiovascular outcomes in a real-world environment.

AB  - Gait and balance impairments are linked with reduced mobility and increased risk of falling. Wearable sensing technologies, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), may augment clinical assessments by providing continuous, high-resolution data. This study tested and validated the utility of a single IMU to quantify gait and balance features during routine clinical outcome tests, and evaluated changes in sensor-derived measurements with age, sex, height, and weight. Age-ranged, healthy individuals (N = 49, 20-70 years) wore a lower back IMU during the 10 m walk test (10MWT), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Spatiotemporal gait parameters computed from the sensor data were validated against gold standard measures, demonstrating excellent agreement for stance time, step time, gait velocity, and step count (intraclass correlation (ICC) > 0.90). There was good agreement for swing time (ICC = 0.78) and moderate agreement for step length (ICC = 0.68). A total of 184 features were calculated from the acceleration and angular velocity signals across these tests, 36 of which had significant correlations with age. This approach was also demonstrated for an individual with stroke, providing higher resolution information about balance, gait, and mobility than the clinical test scores alone. Leveraging mobility data from wireless, wearable sensors can help clinicians and patients more objectively pinpoint impairments, track progression, and set personalized goals during and after rehabilitation.

AB  - In the field of medicinal applications, early / (Timely) detection of Breast cancer is a key diagnosing process which provides effective medical treatment and also reduces women mortality. Due to the advancement and growth of medical sciences, efficient antennas are needed for imaging, diagnosing and providing superior treatment to the patients. Since tumor is tiny in size at the early stage, the knowledge of its precise location is chiefly required. For this purpose several antennas with high accuracy are designed. Among them, Flexible antenna has several advantages compared to other antennas. The main advantage of flexible antenna is its simple construction, high gain and cost-efficiency. The proposed research work implements a novel flexible antenna for detection of early breast cancer, with and without tumor application. In the study, (for the sake of comprehensive analysis and accuracy / familiarity / simplicity), Jean material is used as dielectric substrate with dielectric constant 1.7. The flexible antennas are designed with a slot loaded over the patch and with ground plane that are made up of copper as the conducting material. The jeans cloth material with 1mm thickness is considered as a substrate, which is to be placed on the breast surface. Co-axial feeding method is chosen for the proposed antenna which improves the antenna performance. In addition to this, the antenna is a wearable textile type designed for ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band 2.4GHz applications. The antenna is simulated using HFSS (High Frequency Structure Spectrum) software. From the simulation analysis, Return loss (S-11), Gain in dB, Radiation pattern, axial ratio (AR) and VSWR are obtained and analyzed. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the existing methodologies.

AB  - In the images recorded by imaging through semi-reflective medium such as glass, reflections of another scene can also be observed. It reduces the image quality and influences the analyses below. As these image analysis plays a significant role in the field of health care. IoT performs the process of extraction on the image collected and those useful images data are been used for deep learning process. Here the cognitive ability gets the significant improvement based on the services in science and technology associated the integration of deep learning. This research seeks a new, complete solution for the neural network to solve the picture reflection problem. Besides its prolonged computation time, standard reflection removal methods cannot ensure the performance of different optimization features. As the display cameras today are readily available on image devices, this research proposes for the first time an approach to multi-image depth measuring using a convolutionary neural network (CNN). The network that is presented avoids the issue of deep uncertainty because of image reflections and estimates the distance of the reflected objects. The image enhancement can be applied in the health care for the process of diagnosis, i.e. cancer image. Then they are used as a background or consideration to identify the reflected objects. The removal system helps in removing the unwanted objects and optimize the image to perform effective diagnosis and treatment in health care. Cognitive Computing also associated with deep learning to perform decision making based on the vase amount of data using CNN. This research suggests an image enhancement technique before removing the reflections in the image so that the clustering calculations will become flexible. Compared with current approaches using conventional optimization methods, the proposed algorithm is also much faster.

AB  - In this paper, a novel design for an ultra-wide-band (UWB) microstrip it s antenna with enhanced bandwidth for early detection of breast cancer has been proposed. It has been designed using CST software, which is a 3D analysis software package for electromagnetic components and systems design, analysis, and optimization. FR-4 has been used as a substrate, with dimensions of 60 x 70 mm, having a circular patch with a defected ground structure to reach the desired outcomes. The antenna has a peak gain of 4.431 dBi and works between 1.6 GHz and 10 GHz, which gives a bandwidth of 8.4 GHz with an average of -15 dB. The result of the simulation is presented in terms of radiation pattern, bandwidth, and return loss, and the validation of the proposed work is presented by the gain and the efficiency. A breast phantom model has been designed containing a tumor placed in a specific location, This, when combined with the kinetics of contrast medium propagation in various tissues, may effectively simulate normal breast tissue. The cancerous tumor is detected using specific absorption rate (SAR) analysis. The SAR is the rate of energy absorption in a tissue and is measured in W/kg. The SAR results are a maximum at the coordinates (1.085, 9.47273, 3225), close to the actual location of the tumor at (0, 10, 40) The results display the ability to detect the tumor inside the breast and to reveal its location with high accuracy, and the antenna radiation meet the SAR standards.

AB  - Detecting when a person leaves a room, or a house is essential to create a safe living environment for people suffering from dementia or other mental disorders. The approaches based on wearable devices, e.g. GPS bracelets may detect such events require periodic maintenance to recharge or replace batteries, and therefore may not be suitable for certain types of users. On the other hand, camera-based systems require illumination and raise potential privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a device-free walking direction detection approach based on RF-sensing, which does not require a person to wear any equipment. The proposed approach monitors the signal strength fluctuations caused by the human body on ambient wireless links and analyses its spatial patterns using a convolutional neural network to identify the walking direction. The approach has been evaluated experimentally to achieve up to 98% classification accuracy depending on the environment.

KW  - MOBILE HEALTH
AB  - Background In-person, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves physical activity and reduces morbidity and mortality for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, activity levels may not be optimized and decline over time after patients graduate from cardiac rehabilitation. Scalable interventions through mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to augment activity levels and extend the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation.
   Methods The VALENTINE Study is a prospective, randomized-controlled, remotely-administered trial designed to eval-uate an mHealth intervention to supplement cardiac rehabilitation for low- and moderate-risk patients (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04587882). Participants are randomized to the control or intervention arms of the study. Both groups receive a compat-ible smartwatch (Fitbit Versa 2 or Apple Watch 4) and usual care. Participants in the intervention arm of the study additionally receive a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) delivered as contextually tailored notifications promoting low-level physi-cal activity and exercise throughout the day. In addition, they have access to activity tracking and goal setting through the mobile study application and receive weekly activity summaries via email. The primary outcome is change in 6-minute walk distance at 6-months and, secondarily, change in average daily step count. Exploratory analyses will examine the impact of notifications on immediate short-term smartwatch-measured step counts and exercise minutes.
   Conclusions The VALENTINE study leverages innovative techniques in behavioral and cardiovascular disease research and will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how to support patients using mHealth technologies to promote and sustain physical activity.

AB  - Background Digital biomarkers are a promising novel method to capture clinical data in a home setting. However, clinical validation prior to implementation is of vital importance. The aim of this study was to clinically validate physical activity, heart rate, sleep and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) as digital biomarkers measured by a smartwatch and portable spirometer in children with asthma and cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods This was a prospective cohort study including 60 children with asthma and 30 children with CF (aged 6-16 years). Participants wore a smartwatch, performed daily spirometry at home and completed a daily symptom questionnaire for 28 days. Physical activity, heart rate, sleep and FEV1 were considered candidate digital end-points. Data from 128 healthy children were used for comparison. Reported outcomes were compliance, difference between patients and controls, correlation with disease activity, and potential to detect clinical events. Analysis was performed with linear mixed effects models. Results Median compliance was 88%. On average, patients exhibited lower physical activity and FEV1 compared with healthy children, whereas the heart rate of children with asthma was higher compared with healthy children. Days with a higher symptom score were associated with lower physical activity for children with uncontrolled asthma and CF. Furthermore, FEV1 was lower and (nocturnal) heart rate was higher for both patient groups on days with more symptoms. Candidate biomarkers appeared able to describe a pulmonary exacerbation. Conclusions Portable spirometer- and smartwatch-derived digital biomarkers show promise as candidate end-points for use in clinical trials or clinical care in paediatric lung disease.

AB  - Accurate assessment of dietary macronutrients intake is critical for the effective management of multiple diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease, and cancer. Conventional selfreporting method is burdensome, inaccurate, and often biased. Though blood analysis and breath analysis can provide evidence-based information, they are either invasive or subject to human errors. Here we reported a wearable transdermal volatile biomarkers detection system based on novel colorimetric sensing technology for dietary macronutrients intake assessment. This technique quantifies the emission rates of transdermal volatile biomarkers via a gradient-based colorimetric array sensor (GCAS). The optical system of the GCAS device tracks the localized color development associated with the chemical reaction between the volatile biomarkers and the porous sensing probes, and determines the biomarkers emission rates through image processing algorithms. The localized chemical reaction and the image-based signal processing also make the GCAS capable for multiplexed detection of multiple analytes simultaneously. The GCAS sensor has been applied for transdermal acetone detection on 5 subjects in a keto diet intervention. The study indicates that the transdermal acetone increases after the subjects consuming keto diets and it decreases to basal level after intaking carb-rich diets. The transdermal acetone response from the GCAS sensor correlates well with breath acetone concentration in the range between 0 and 40 ppm and the correlation factor (R2) is as high as 0.8877. This method provides a noninvasive, low-cost, and wearable tool for assessing dietary macronutrients intake outside of lab or hospital settings. It could be widely applied in disease management, weight control, and nutrition management.

AB  - We demonstrate for the first time a wearable biochemical sensor for monitoring alcohol consumption through the detection and quantification of a metabolite of ethanol, ethyl glucuronide (EtG). We designed and fabricated two co-planar sensors with gold and zinc oxide as sensing electrodes. We also designed a LED based reporting for the presence of EtG in the human sweat samples. The sensor functions on affinity based immunoassay principles whereby monoclonal antibodies for EtG were immobilized on the electrodes using thiol based chemistry. Detection of EtG from human sweat was achieved through chemiresistive sensing mechanism. In this method, an AC voltage was applied across the two coplanar electrodes and the impedance across the sensor electrodes was measured and calibrated for physiologically relevant doses of EtG in human sweat. EtG detection over a dose concentration of 0.001-100 mu g/L was demonstrated on both glass and polyimide substrates. Detection sensitivity was lower at 1 mu g/L with gold electrodes as compared to ZnO, which had detection sensitivity of 0.001 mu g/L. Based on the detection range the wearable sensor has the ability to detect alcohol consumption of up to 11 standard drinks in the US over a period of 4 to 9 hours.

AB  - Background: Brain metastases (BM) are frequent in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, but there is a lack of evidence-based management of this patient group. We aimed to capture a snapshot of routine BM management in Europe to identify relevant research questions for future clinical trials.
   Methods: An EORTC Lung Cancer Group (LCG) online survey containing questions on NSCLC BM screening and treatment was distributed between 16/02/17 and 15/06/17 to worldwide EORTC LCG members, and through several European scientific societies in the thoracic oncology field.
   Results: A total of 462 European physician responses (394 institutions) were analysed (radiation oncologist: 53% [n = 247], pulmonologist: 26% [n = 119], medical oncologist: 18% [n = 84]; 84% with >5 years' experience in NSCLC). Italy (18%, n = 85), Netherlands (15%, n = 68), UK (14%, n = 66), and France (12%, n = 55) contributed most. 393 physicians (85%) screened neurologically asymptomatic patients for BM at diagnosis (52% using magnetic resonance imaging). Most often screened patients were those with a driver mutation (MUT+; 51%, n = 234), stage III (63%, n = 289), and IV (43%, n = 199). 158 physicians (34%) used a prognostic classification to guide initial treatment decisions, and in 50%, lowest prognostic-score threshold to receive treatment differed between MUT+ and non-driver mutation (MUT-) patients. MUT+ patients with >4 BM were more likely to receive stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with MUT- (27% versus. 21%; p < 0.01). Most physicians (90%) had access to SRS. After single BM surgery, 50% systematically prescribed SRS or WBRT, and 45% only in case of incomplete resection. The preferred treatment in neurologically asymptomatic treatment-naive patients diagnosed with >5 BM was systemic treatment (79%). Of all, 45%/49% physicians stated that all tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockers were discontinued (timing varied) during SRS/WBRT, respectively. Drugs most often continued during SRS/WBRT were erlotinib (44%/40%), gefitinib (39%/34%), afatinib (29%/25%), crizotinib (33%/26%) and anti-PD-(L)-1 (28%/22%).
   Conclusion: BM management is highly variable in Europe: screening is not uniform, prognostic classifications are not often used and MUT+ NSCLC patients generally receive more intensive local treatment. Prospective assessment of BM management in MUT+ NSCLC patients is required. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Activities of daily living (ADL) are important indicators for awareness of brain health in the elderly, and hospitals use ADL as a standard test for diagnosing chronic brain diseases such as dementia. However, since it is difficult to judge real-life ADL in hospitals, doctors typically predict ADL ability through interviews with patients or accompanying caregivers. Recently, many studies have attempted to diagnose accurate brain health by collecting and analyzing the real-life ADL of patients in their living environments. However, most of these were conducted by constructing and implementing expensive smart homes with the concept of centralized computing, and ADL data were collected from simple data about patients' home appliance usage and the surrounding environment. Despite the high cost of building a smart home, the collected ADL data are inadequate for predicting accurate brain health. In this study, we developed and used three types of portable devices (wearable, tag, and stationary) that can be easily installed and operated in typical existing houses. We propose a self-organized device network structure based on edge computing that can perform user perception, location perception, and behavioral perception simultaneously. This approach enables us to collect user activity data, analyze ADL in real-time to determine if the user's behavior was successful or abnormal, and record the physical ability of the user to move between fixed spaces. The characteristics of this proposed system enable us to distinguish patients from other family members and provide real-time notifications after a forgetful or mistaken action. We implemented devices that constitute the edge network of the smart home scenario and evaluated the performance of this system to verify its usefulness.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the current high prevalence of dementia, more than half of older adult patients never receive an evaluation. Current evaluation methods are lengthy, cumbersome, and not viable for busy clinics. This indicates that, despite recent improvements, a quick and objective routine test for screening cognitive decline in older adults is still needed. Poor dual-task gait performance has been previously associated with decreased ex-ecutive and neuropsychological function. However, gait tests are not always viable for clinics or older patients.Methods: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between a novel upper-extremity function (UEF) dual-task performance and neuropsychological test results in older adults. For UEF dual-tasks, participants performed a consistent elbow flexion and extension, while counting backwards in increments of threes or ones. Wearable motion sensors were attached to the forearm and upper-arm to measure accuracy and speed of elbow flexion kinematics to calculate a UEF cognitive score.Results: We recruited older adults at three stages: cognitively normal (CN) (n = 35), mild cognitively impaired (MCI) of the Alzheimer's type (n = 34), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 22). The results demonstrate sig-nificant correlations between UEF cognitive score and mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Mini-Cog, Category fluency, Benson complex figure copy, Trail making test, and Montreal cognitive assessment (MOCA) (r values between-0.2355 and-0.6037 and p < 0.0288).Discussion: UEF dual-task was associated with executive function, orientation, repetition, abstraction, verbal recall, attention and calculation, language and visual construction. Of the associated brain domains, UEF dual -task was most significantly associated with executive function, visual construction, and delayed recall. The re-sults from this study convey potential for UEF dual-task as a safe and convenient cognitive impairment screening method.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   The objective of this study was to determine the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of a predictive hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia minimization (PHHM) system compared with predictive low-glucose insulin suspension (PLGS) alone in overnight glucose control.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   A 42-night trial was conducted in 30 individuals with type 1 diabetes in the age range 15-45 years. Participants were randomly assigned each night to either PHHM or PLGS and were blinded to the assignment. The system suspended the insulin pump on both the PHHM and PLGS nights for predicted hypoglycemia but delivered correction boluses for predicted hyperglycemia on PHHM nights only. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent in a sensor glucose range of 70-180 mg/dL during the overnight period.
   RESULTS
   The addition of automated insulin delivery with PHHMincreased the time spent in the target range (70-180 mg/dL) from 71 6 10% during PLGS nights to 78 6 10% during PHHMnights (P < 0.001). The averagemorning blood glucose concentration improved from 163 6 23 mg/dL after PLGS nights to 142 6 18 mg/dL after PHHM nights (P < 0.001). Various sensor-measured hypoglycemic outcomes were similar on PLGS and PHHM nights. All participants completed 42 nights with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, or other study-or device-related adverse events.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The addition of a predictive hyperglycemia minimization component to our existing PLGS systemwas shown to be safe, feasible, and effective in overnight glucose control.

AB  - Background An accurate prediction model could identify high-risk subjects of incident Overactive bladder (OAB) among the general population and enable early prevention which may save on the related medical costs. However, no efficient model has been developed for predicting incident OAB. In this study, we will develop a model for predicting the onset of OAB at 5-year in the general population setting. Methods Data will be obtained from the Nagahama Cohort Project, a longitudinal, general population cohort study. The baseline characteristics were measured between Nov 28, 2008 and Nov 28, 2010, and follow-up was performed every 5 years. From the total of 9,764 participants (male: 3,208, female: 6,556) at baseline, we will exclude participants who could not attend the follow-up assessment and those who were defined as having OAB at baseline. The outcome will be incident OAB defined using the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) at follow-up assessment. Baseline questionnaires (demographic, health behavior, comorbidities and OABSS) and blood test data will be included as predictors. We will develop a logistic regression model utilizing shrinkage methods (LASSO penalization method). Model performance will be evaluated by discrimination and calibration. Net benefit will be evaluated by decision curve analysis. We will perform an internal validation and a temporal validation of the model. We will develop a web-based application to visualize the prediction model and facilitate its use in clinical practice. Discussion This will be the first study to develop a model to predict the incidence of OAB.

AB  - Objective assessment of stroke survivors' upper limb movements in ambulatory settings can provide clinicians with important information regarding the real impact of rehabilitation outside the clinic and help to establish individually-tailored therapeutic programs. This paper explores a novel approach to monitor the amount of hand use, which is relevant to the purposeful, goal-directed use of the limbs, based on a body networked sensor system composed of miniaturized finger- and wrist-worn accelerometers. The main contributions of this paper are twofold. First, this paper introduces and validates a new benchmark measurement of the amount of hand use based on data recorded by a motion capture system, the gold standard for human movement analysis. Second, this paper introduces a machine learning-based analytic pipeline that estimates the amount of hand use using data obtained from the wearable sensors and validates its estimation performance against the aforementioned benchmark measurement. Based on data collected from 18 neurologically intact individuals performing 11 motor tasks resembling various activities of daily living, the analytic results presented herein show that our new benchmark measure is reliable and responsive, and that the proposed wearable system can yield an accurate estimation of the amount of hand use (normalized root mean square error of 0.11 and average Pearson correlation of 0.78). This study has the potential to open up new research and clinical opportunities for monitoring hand function in ambulatory settings, ultimately enabling evidence-based, patient-centered rehabilitation and healthcare.

AB  - Soft hand exoskeletons offer a lightweight, low-profile alternative to rigid rehabilitative robotic systems, enabling their use to restore activities of daily living (ADL) in those with hand paresis due to stroke or other conditions. The hand exoskeleton with embedded synergies (HEXOES) is a soft cable-driven hand exoskeleton capable of independently actuating and sensing 10 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the hand. Control of the 10 DoF exoskeleton is dimensionally reduced using three manually defined synergies in software corresponding to thumb, index, and 3-finger flexion and extension. In this paper, five healthy subjects control HEXOES using a neural network which decodes synergy weights from contralateral electromyography (EMG) activity. The three synergies are manipulated in real time to grasp and lift 15 ADL objects of various sizes and weights. The neural networks training and validation mean squared error, object grasp time, and grasp success rate were measured for five healthy subjects. The final training error of the neural network was 4.8 1.8 averaged across subjects and tasks, with 8.3 3.4 validation error. The time to reach, grasp, and lift an object was 11.15 4.35s on average, with an average success rate of 66.7 across all objects. The complete system demonstrates real time use of biosignals and machine learning to allow subjects to operate kinematic synergies to grasp objects using a wearable hand exoskeleton. Future work and applications are further discussed, including possible design improvements and enrollment of individuals with stroke.

AB  - We describe the protocol, design, and methodology of the Prediction, Risk, and Evaluation of Major Adverse Cardiac Events (PRE-MACE) study as a multicomponent remote patient monitoring in cardiology. Using biosensor, biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes in participants with stable ischemic heart disease, the PRE-MACE study is designed to measure cross-sectional correlations and establish the ability of remote monitoring to predict major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) biomarkers and incident MACE at baseline and 12-month follow-up. It will further assess the adherence and cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring and blood sampling over the initial months. Despite medication and lifestyle changes, patients with cardiovascular disease can experience MACE due to undertreatment, poor adherence, or failure to recognize clinical or biochemical changes that presage MACE. Identifying patients using remote monitoring to detect MACE forerunners has potential to improve outcomes, avoid MACE, and reduce resource utilization. Data collection will include: (1) continuous remote monitoring using wearable biosensors; (2) biomarker measurements using plasma and at-home micro-sampling blood collection; and (3) patient-reported outcomes to monitor perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and health-related quality of life. Two hundred participants will be followed for 90 days with a subset (n = 80) monitored for 180 days. All participants will be followed up for MACE at 12 months.The PRE-MACE study will utilize remote monitoring with biosensors, biomarkers, and patient-reported outcomes to identify intermediate biomarkers of MACE in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. If shown to be effective, this intervention can be utilized between health visits to predict MACE and reduce financial impact of MACE.

AB  - Background: The ubiquity of mobile phones and increasing use of wearable fitness trackers offer a wide-ranging window into people's health and well-being. There are clear advantages in using remote monitoring technologies to gain an insight into health, particularly under the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Objective: Covid Collab is a crowdsourced study that was set up to investigate the feasibility of identifying, monitoring, and understanding the stratification of SARS-CoV-2 infection and recovery through remote monitoring technologies. Additionally, we will assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social measures on people's behavior, physical health, and mental well-being.
   Methods: Participants will remotely enroll in the study through the Mass Science app to donate historic and prospective mobile phone data, fitness tracking wearable data, and regular COVID-19-related and mental health-related survey data. The data collection period will cover a continuous period (ie, both before and after any reported infections), so that comparisons to a participant's own baseline can be made. We plan to carry out analyses in several areas, which will cover symptomatology; risk factors; the machine learning-based classification of illness; and trajectories of recovery, mental well-being, and activity.
   Results: As of June 2021, there are over 17,000 participants-largely from the United Kingdom-and enrollment is ongoing.
   Conclusions: This paper introduces a crowdsourced study that will include remotely enrolled participants to record mobile health data throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The data collected may help researchers investigate a variety of areas, including COVID-19 progression; mental well-being during the pandemic; and the adherence of remote, digitally enrolled participants.

AB  - PURPOSE Performance status (PS) is a subjective assessment of patients' overall health. Quantification of physical activity using a wearable tracker (Fitbit Charge [FC]) may provide an objective measure of patient's overall PS and treatment tolerance.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with colorectal cancer were prospectively enrolled into two cohorts (medical and surgical) and asked to wear FC for 4 days at baseline (start of new chemotherapy [+/- 4 weeks] or prior to curative resection) and follow-up (4 weeks [+/- 2 weeks] after initial assessment in medical and postoperative discharge in surgical cohort). Primary end point was feasibility, defined as 75% of patients wearing FC for at least 12 hours/d, 3 of 4 assigned days. Mean steps per day (SPD) were correlated with toxicities of interest (postoperative complication or >= grade 3 toxicity). A cutoff of 5,000 SPD was selected to compare outcomes.
   RESULTS Eighty patients were accrued over 3 years with 55% males and a median age of 59.5 years. Feasibility end point was met with 68 patients (85%) wearing FC more than predefined duration and majority (91%) finding its use acceptable. The mean SPD count for patients with PS 0 was 6,313, and for those with PS 1, it was 2,925 (122 and 54 active minutes, respectively) (P = .0003). Occurrence of toxicity of interest was lower among patients with SPD. 5,000 (7 of 33, 21%) compared with those with SPD, 5,000 (14 of 43, 32%), although not significant (P = .31).
   CONCLUSION Assessment of physical activity with FC is feasible in patients with colorectal cancer and well-accepted. SPD may serve as an adjunct to PS assessment and a possible tool to help predict toxicities, regardless of type of therapy. Future studies incorporating FC can standardize patient assessment and help identify vulnerable population. (c) 2021 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - Cardio Vascular Diseases (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally and is increasing at an alarming rate, according to the American Heart Association's Heart Attack and Stroke Statistics-2021. This increase has been further exacerbated because of the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, thereby increasing the pressure on existing healthcare resources. Smart and Connected Health (SCH) is a viable solution for the prevalent healthcare challenges. It can reshape the course of healthcare to be more strategic, preventive, and custom-designed, making it more effective with value-added services. This research endeavors to classify state-of-the-art SCH technologies via a thorough literature review and analysis to comprehensively define SCH features and identify the enabling technology-related challenges in SCH adoption. We also propose an architectural model that captures the technological aspect of the SCH solution, its environment, and its primary involved stakeholders. It serves as a reference model for SCH acceptance and implementation. We reflected the COVID-19 case study illustrating how some countries have tackled the pandemic differently in terms of leveraging the power of different SCH technologies, such as big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, robotics, blockchain, and mobile applications. In combating the pandemic, SCH has been used efficiently at different stages such as disease diagnosis, virus detection, individual monitoring, tracking, controlling, and resource allocation. Furthermore, this review highlights the challenges to SCH acceptance, as well as the potential research directions for better patient-centric healthcare.

AB  - Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (LV-EF < 35%) is diagnosed in app. 11,000,000 patients worldwide. For the treatment of these patients, guideline directed medical therapy has proven to reduce mortality and rehospitalization regardless of the disease's etiology. It is implemented to treat clinical symptoms by improving the left ventricular ejection fraction. Patients with a transient risk of ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death can be protected by a defibrillator vest. The defibrillator vest is capable to detect and terminate ventricular arrhythmias during Guideline Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT). It is based on the recommendations of the European society of cardiology for 3 months. Afterwards, the WCD wear time could be prolonged, or, in case of persistent low ejection fraction (LV-EF <= 35%), an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) should be implanted, as shown in the WEARIT-II-registry. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of GDMT on LV-recovery and reduction of ICD implantations under protection with a defibrillator vest-depending on the uptitration of GDMT. Methods: 339 consecutive patients between August 2017 and September 2020 with newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy and an EF <= 35% were analyzed retrospectively by chart review. All patients were protected by a wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD). GDMT as recommended by the ESC started at discharge from hospital. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LV-EF) was determined by transthoracic echocardiography at week 4, 8 and at week 12 (in case of prolonged WCD wear time). Uptitration was performed after 4 and 8 weeks during patient visits. We focused on baseline medication as per GDMT and the dosage increase at week 4, 8 and 12. The aim was the uptitration to the maximum dosage tolerated by the patient. We also compared the LV-EF improvement in the group with and without uptitration of medication dosage. Results: The patient age was, on average, 63.2 years (SD +/- 11.9 years). A total of 129 pts (38%) had ICM, 196 (58%) had NICM (incl 66 pts (19%) with DCM and 51 pts (15%) with Myocarditis, 79 pts (24%) with unknown origin) and 14 pts (4%) had other entities (e.g., Tachycardiomyopathy). In total, 21 pts (6%) had an LV-EF of less than 16%, 130 pts (38%) between 16-25% and 183 pts (54%) between 26-35%. GDMT started at discharge from the hospital included treatment with beta blocker for 327 pts (96.5%), ACE-inhibitors/Angiotensin/ARNI for 283 pts (83.5%) and Mineralcorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) for 334 pts (88.4%). Uptitration was performed in all groups at a rate of 82.3%, 91.1% and 81.0% after 4 weeks and 64.7%, 50.3% and 66.3% after 8 weeks, respectively. After 4 weeks, 25 pts (7.4%) and, after 8 weeks, 171 pts (50.4%) had an EF increase of 5% or more (mean 14.2%). After 4 weeks, 81 patients had an LV-EF more than 35%. A total of 169 pts had a wear time of 12 weeks and an improvement of LVEF of more than 35%. Interestingly, in our study we did not find a significant difference in LV-EF improvement between the group with no uptitration and the group with uptitration. Conclusions: Guideline-directed medical therapy under protection with a WCD from ventricular arrhythmia can reduce the need for implantation of an ICD and can lead to an improvement of ejection fraction. Interestingly, the LV-EF improvement depends on the GDMT at discharge.
   Current guidelines recommend an initiation of all therapy columns of GDMT (sacubitril/valsartan, ACE-inhibitor/AT1-blocker, mineralcorticoidreceptorblocker, beta blocker) at once and further uptitration to the maximal dosage (ESC Guidelines 2021). A further uptitration of all drugs of GDMT should lead to improvement of LV-EF and consequently to a reduction in ICD implantations.

AB  - Most upper limb rehabilitation patients are still hard to feel the accuracy force they have imposed in the end of arm after a systematic upper limb rehabilitation. In order to provide an accurate end-of-arm force for those disabled people, a force display system based on wearable arm gesture sensors and Electromyographic (EMG) sensors is designed and given in this paper. The wearable arm gesture sensors and EMG sensors are specially placed to detect the arm gesture and the EMG signal of the arm, and a force sensor is used to measure the force and verify the force display effect. In order to control the rehabilitation arm move slowly at a constant speed, the kinematic model of the upper arm is analyzed. A special experiment platform is established so as to get the simultaneous data of end-of-arm force and the arm gesture and EMG signal, then the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) is brought in to catch the relationship between them. A group of horizontal movement experiment and vertical movement experiment are designed specially and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the system. The result shows that the information fusion based on GRNN for this system could accurately display the end-of-arm force. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Continuous, real-time monitoring of biomarkers associated with local regions of the body can enhance both temporal and dimensional accuracy of proactive treatment to acute syndromes for critical illnesses, especially peripheral artery diseases. Conventional health monitors often face grand challenges in leveraging deep-tissue sensing capability with a safe and compatible biointerface. Optical-based noninvasive monitors may lack the ability to detect oximetry under subcutaneous fatty tissue due to the light scattering and absorption; implantables offer targeted sensing at depth, but may induce infection and inflammation. This report puts forward a wireless, wearable deep-tissue sensing patch by incorporating biocompatible microneedle waveguides at the sensing interface, to bypass the light extinction in epidermic and dermic tissue and enable the tracking of oximetry at muscular tissue. The sensing patch provides multiple physiological measurements at the sensing area, including tissue oximetry, pulse oximetry, heart pulsation, and respiratory activities with a wireless platform for uninterrupted data advertising and processing to enable real-time diagnostic analysis. The mechanical and thermal characterizations of the sensing patch with the microneedle waveguides validate the durable and safe operation at the skin interface. In vivo study with animal models of hindlimb ischemia demonstrates the high sensitivity and timely response of the sensing patch as muscle tissue hypoxia emerges.

AB  - Simple Summary Cancer is associated with significant morbimortality worldwide. Although significant advances have been made in the last few decades in terms of early detection and treatment, providing personalized care remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a means of improving cancer care with the use of computer science. Identification of risk factors for poor prognosis and patient profiling with AI techniques and tools is feasible and has potential application in clinical settings, including surveillance management. The goal of this study is to present an AI-based solution tool for cancer patients data analysis and improve their management by identifying clinical factors associated with relapse and survival, developing a prognostic model that identifies features associated with poor prognosis, and stratifying patients by risk. Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has contributed substantially in recent years to the resolution of different biomedical problems, including cancer. However, AI tools with significant and widespread impact in oncology remain scarce. The goal of this study is to present an AI-based solution tool for cancer patients data analysis that assists clinicians in identifying the clinical factors associated with poor prognosis, relapse and survival, and to develop a prognostic model that stratifies patients by risk. Materials and Methods: We used clinical data from 5275 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma at Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro-Majadahonda. Accessible clinical parameters measured with a wearable device and quality of life questionnaires data were also collected. Results: Using an AI-tool, data from 5275 cancer patients were analyzed, integrating clinical data, questionnaires data, and data collected from wearable devices. Descriptive analyses were performed in order to explore the patients' characteristics, survival probabilities were calculated, and a prognostic model identified low and high-risk profile patients. Conclusion: Overall, the reconstruction of the population's risk profile for the cancer-specific predictive model was achieved and proved useful in clinical practice using artificial intelligence. It has potential application in clinical settings to improve risk stratification, early detection, and surveillance management of cancer patients.

AB  - Sleep apnea (SA) is the most common respiratory sleep disorder, leading to some serious neurological and cardiovascular diseases if left untreated. The diagnosis of SA is traditionally made using Polysomnography (PSG). However, this method requires many electrodes and wires, as well as an expert to monitor the test. Several researchers have proposed instead using a single channel signal for SA diagnosis. Among these options, the ECG signal is one of the most physiologically relevant signals of SA occurrence, and one that can be easily recorded using a wearable device. However, existing ECG signal-based methods mainly use features (i.e. frequency domain, time domain, and other nonlinear features) acquired from ECG and its derived signals in order to construct the model. This requires researchers to have rich experience in ECG, which is not common. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a kind of deep neural network that can automatically learn effective feature representation from training data and has been successfully applied in many fields. Meanwhile, most studies have not considered the impact of adjacent segments on SA detection. Therefore, in this study, we propose a modified LeNet-5 convolutional neural network with adjacent segments for SA detection. Our experimental results show that our proposed method is useful for SA detection, and achieves better or comparable results when compared with traditional machine learning methods.

AB  - Squat exercise is frequently used in physiotherapy rehabilitation for stroke patients. In the early stage of rehabilitation, patients are urged to avoid performing any deep squat as the strains on tendon and ligament are much higher compared to the half-squat exercise. Therefore, it is important for patients to be aware of their squat depth. One of the ways to measure squat depth is by using a wearable device which adds unnecessary weight to the patients and makes them feel uncomfortable. Thus, we propose a single camera system that captures video from the frontal view to measure the squat angle continuously according to the number of frames per second. The system will provide knee angle measurements for every frame taken based on a combined approach of deep learning tracking and deep belief networks regressor. The proposed system requires just a bounding box input of the whole test subject taken at an upright position, which will later be the input to a convolutional neural networks-based tracker. Both the head and upper body parts of the exerciser will be tracked independently. The resultant tracked points will be normalized with the test subject height to find the ratio of height to the corresponding points. The ratio features are then will be the input to multiple deep belief networks' regressors to predict the knee angle. The mean of ratio features will be used to segregate the input frame into its respective regressor. The experimental results show that the system produces the lowest mean error angle of 8.64 degrees based on the setup of five regressors with each of them consists of five hidden layers. Hence, it is suitable to be implemented in a squat angle monitoring system to notify the patients of their squat angle depth.

AB  - Background: The development of evidence-based interventions for delaying or preventing cognitive impairment is an important challenge. Most previous studies using self-report questionnaires face problems with reliability and consistency due to recall bias or misclassification among older people. Therefore, objective measurement of lifestyle components is needed to confirm the relationships between lifestyle factors and cognitive function.
   Aims: The current study examined the relationship between lifestyle factors collected with wearable sensors and cognitive function among community-dwelling older people using machine learning.
   Methods: In total, 855 participants (mean age: 73.8 years) wore a wristband sensor for 7.8 days on average every 3 months. Various lifestyle parameters were measured, including walking steps, conversation time, total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency, time awake after sleep onset, awakening count, napping time, and heart rate. Random forest (RF) regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between total daily sensing data and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Confounding factor analysis was conducted with models that were adjusted and unadjusted for demographic and vascular risk factors, and selected variables were assessed as risk and protective factors using partial dependence plots (PDPs).
   Results: Lifestyle data were collected for 31.3 +/- 7.1 days per year using wristband sensors. RF regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, and education levels selected four variables, including number of walking steps, conversation time, TST, and heart rate. Moreover, walking steps, conversation time, and heart rate remained after RF regression analysis adjusted for demographic and vascular risk factors. Number of walking steps, conversation time, and heart rate were categorized as protective factors, whereas TST was categorized as a risk factor for cognitive function. Although PDPs of number of walking steps and heart rate revealed continuously increased MMSE scores, those of conversation time and TST and revealed that the tendency in the graph was reversed at the boundary of a particular threshold (321.1 min for conversation time, 434.1 min for TST).
   Conclusions: Lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, sleep, and social activity appear to be associated with cognitive function among older people. Physical activity and appropriate durations of sleep and conversation are important for cognitive function.

AB  - Background: A large number of wearable and implantable electronic medical devices are widely used in clinic and playing an increasingly important role in diagnosis and treatment, but the limited battery capacity restricts their service life and function expansion. Piezoelectric nanogenerators can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. Our experiment tries to find out if the piezoelectric nanogenerator fixed to the surface of the heart can convert the natural contractions and relaxations of the heart into stable electric energy for electronic medical devices such as pacemakers.
   Methods: We used Chinese miniature pig and prepared with standard open chest procedure. Then we fixed two opposite edges of the rectangular nanogenerator at the following three positions of the heart respectively to detect the electric voltage output: Position A, right ventricular surface, near the atrioventricular groove, parallel to the long axis of the heart; Position B, right ventricular surface, parallel to the atrioventricular groove; and Position C, left ventricular surface, near cardiac apex, parallel to the left anterior descending branch. Then we selected the place which has the highest voltage output to fix both ends of the nanogenerator and closed the chest of pig. We recorded the voltage output of nanogenerator under closed chest condition (natural condition) and compared the result with open chest condition. Finally we used Dopamine (positive inotropic agents) and Esmolol (negative inotropic agents) respectively to detect the relation between voltage output of nanogenerator and myocardial contractility.
   Results: With its both ends fixed on the surface of the heart, the piezoelectric nanogenerator produced stable voltage output from the mechanical contractions of the heart. Piezoelectric nanogenerator which was fixed at Position A produced the highest voltage output (3.1 V), compared with those fixed at Position B or Position C. The voltage is enough for the pacemaker's operation. The voltage output of piezoelectric nanogenerator at the natural condition (closed chest) was the same as the open chest condition and made a light emitting diode (LED) light continue to shine, which further confirmed its clinical application value. The voltage output of piezoelectric nanogenerator is positively correlated with the myocardial contractile force. The voltage output increased after we used positive inotropic agents and decreased after we used negative inotropic agents.
   Conclusions: Piezoelectric nanogenerators can convert the kinetic energy of the heart during the contractions and relaxations of the muscles to electric energy. The output voltage was stable in three positions on the surface of the heart. The highest voltage appeared on the surface of right ventricle, near atrioventricular groove, parallel to the long axis direction of the heart, which can be the potential new energy source for pacemakers. Piezoelectric nanogenerator can be used as cardiac function monitor in the future for its voltage output is positively correlated with myocardial contractile force.

AB  - Healthy adults and neurological patients show unique mobility patterns over the course of their lifespan and disease. Quantifying these mobility patterns could support diagnosing, tracking disease progression and measuring response to treatment. This quantification can be done with wearable technology, such as inertial measurement units (IMUs). Before IMUs can be used to quantify mobility, algorithms need to be developed and validated with age and disease-specific datasets. This study proposes a protocol for a dataset that can be used to develop and validate IMU-based mobility algorithms for healthy adults (18-60 years), healthy older adults (>60 years), and patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, a symptomatic stroke and chronic low back pain. All participants will be measured simultaneously with IMUs and a 3D optical motion capture system while performing standardized mobility tasks and non-standardized activities of daily living. Specific clinical scales and questionnaires will be collected. This study aims at building the largest dataset for the development and validation of IMU-based mobility algorithms for healthy adults and neurological patients. It is anticipated to provide this dataset for further research use and collaboration, with the ultimate goal to bring IMU-based mobility algorithms as quickly as possible into clinical trials and clinical routine.

AB  - Healthcare is an indispensable part of human life and chronic illnesses like cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have a deeply negative impact on the healthcare sector. Since the ever-growing population of chronic patients cannot be managed at hospitals, therefore, there is an urgent need for periodic monitoring of vital parameters and apposite treatment of these patients. In this paper, an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) -based remote patient monitoring system is proposed which is based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and edge computing. The primary focus of this paper is to develop an embedded prototype that can be used for remote monitoring of cardiovascular patients. The system will continuously monitor physiological parameters like body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation, and then report the health status to the authenticated users. The system employs edge computing to perform multiple functionalities including health status inference using a Machine Learning (ML) model which makes predictions on real-time data, alert notifications in case of an emergency, and transferring data between the sensor network and the cloud. A web-based application is developed for the depiction of raw data and ML results and to provide a direct communication channel between the patient and the doctor. The ML module achieved an accuracy of 96.26% on the test set using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNNs) algorithm. This solution aims to address the sense of emergency due to the alarming statistics that highlight the mortality rate of cardiovascular patients. The project will enable a smart option based on IoT and ML to improve standards of living and prove crucial in saving human lives.

AB  - Objective: Diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) usually involves high cost, patient inconvenience, and the need for examination at a specialized center. This study employed a portable, wearable, diagnostic device (WatchPAT) to investigate the prevalence of OSA in nonobese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes were tested for OSA over one night using the WatchPAT. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of risk factors for OSA in nonobese subjects.
   Results: A total of 200 eligible patients with type 2 diabetes were studied (64.5% men; aged 60.1 +/- 13.6 years; body mass index [BMI], 26.3 +/- 5.2 kg/m(2)). When OSA was defined as apnea-hypopnea index..5/hour, its prevalence was 80.5%. The prevalence of OSA in subjects with a BMI <20 kg/m(2), >= 20 and <25 kg/m(2), >= 25 and <30 kg/ m(2), and >= 30 kg/m(2) was 38.9%, 73.5%, 86.5%, and 97.5%, respectively. The severity of OSA increased in proportion to BMI, especially when the BMI was >25 kg /m(2). The prevalence of OSA was also high (66.3%) in normal-weight subjects (BMI <25 kg/m(2)). Furthermore, the serum triglyceride level (OR, 1.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.02; P = .042) was significantly related to OSA.
   Conclusion: A high prevalence of OSA was observed in this nonobese population of Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. The triglyceride level was associated with OSA among nonobese patients.

KW  - Machine learning
AB  - An annotated dataset of measurements obtained using the EurValve Smart Home In a Box (SHIB) rehabilitation monitoring system is presented. The SHiB is a low cost and easily deployable kit designed to collect data from a wrist-worn wearable in a home environment. The data presented is intended to evaluate room level indoor localization methods. The wearable device registers tri-axial accelerometer measurements which are sampled and transmitted as the payload of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) packet. Four receiving gateways, each placed in a different room throughout a typical residential house, extract the accelerometer data and determine a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) for each received BLE packet. RSSI values can represent propagation losses due to distance or shadowing between the wearable transmitter and the gateway receiver.
   The dataset is presented in two parts. The first is composed of four calibration or training sequences, carried out by ten participants to offer ground truth calibrations for four rooms in the house. We refer to the calibration phase as the steps taken to gather training data. The calibration procedure was designed to be as straight-forward as possible, to allow a participant to adequately train the SHiB system without supervision. Ten participants each carried out a straight forward calibration procedure once, with four participants carrying out the calibration twice, on different occasions. One participant carried out the calibration on a third occasion.
   The second part of the data consists of a free-living experiment that was carried out over a period of five and a half hours starting at 7.37 a.m. Of this, one and a half hours of measurements are recorded within a room containing a gateway, where one participant carried out activities of daily living while their ground-truth location was accurately annotated within each room with a gateway present. The calibration data can be used as a training scheme and the living data as a test scenario.

AB  - Core body temperature (CBT) is a key vital sign and fever is an important indicator of disease. In the past decade, there has been growing interest for vital sign monitoring technology that may be embedded in wearable devices, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote patient monitoring systems. While wrist-worn sensors allow continuous assessment of heart rate and oxygen saturation, reliable measurement of CBT at the wrist remains challenging. In this study, CBT was measured continuously in a free-living setting using a novel technology worn at the wrist and compared to reference core body temperature measurements, i.e., CBT values acquired with an ingestible temperature-sensing pill. Fifty individuals who received the COVID-19 booster vaccination were included. The datasets of 33 individuals were used to develop the CBT prediction algorithm, and the algorithm was then validated on the datasets of 17 participants. Mean observation time was 26.4 h and CBT > 38.0 degrees C occurred in 66% of the participants. CBT predicted by the wrist-worn sensor showed good correlation to the reference CBT (r = 0.72). Bland-Altman statistics showed an average bias of 0.11 degrees C of CBT predicted by the wrist-worn device compared to reference CBT, and limits of agreement were - 0.67 to + 0.93 degrees C, which is comparable to the bias and limits of agreement of commonly used tympanic membrane thermometers. The small size of the components needed for this technology would allow its integration into a variety of wearable monitoring systems assessing other vital signs and at the same time allowing maximal freedom of movement to the user.

AB  - Objective: Measurements of ultrawideband (UWB) pulses reflected by the human body are conducted to evidence the differences in the received signal time behaviors due to respiration phases, and to experimentally verify previously obtained numerical results on the body's organs responsible for pulse reflection. Methods: Two experimental setups are used. The first one is based on a commercially available impulse radar system integrated on a single chip, while the second one implements an indirect time-domain reflectometry technique using a vector network analyzer controlled by a LabVIEW virtual instrument running on a laptop. Results: When the UWB source is placed close to the human body, a small reflection due to the lung boundaries is present in the received pulse well distanced in time from the reflection due to the air-skin interface; this reflection proved to be linked to the different respiration phases. Conclusions: The changes in the reflected pulse could be used to detect, through wearable radar systems, lung movements associated with the breath activity. Significance: The development of a wearable radar system is of great importance because it allows the breath activity sensing without interfering with the subject daily activities.

AB  - Real-time, continuous and non-invasive glucose monitoring is essential for the health of diabetic. In this work, we developed soft and transparent smart contact lenses which could detect glucose in tear with high sensitivity. The smart contact lenses were prepared by immobilizing a sensitive glucose fluorescent probe and another reference fluorescent dye into the hydrogel network of the contact lenses. With the increase of glucose concentration, the fluorescent color of the smart contact lenses changed from pink to blue. The fluorescent images could be collected by a smartphone and transformed into RGB signals to quantify the glucose levels. These smart contact lenses could successfully monitor glucose level of 23 mu M-1.0 mM in tears by a smart phone. The animal experiments further demonstrate the biosafety of smart contact lenses and the potential application of glucose monitoring. The fluorescence sensor platform is expected to be a new method for painless glucose monitoring.

AB  - Aim The main purpose of the present study was to verify the feasibility of wearable inertial sensors (IMUs) in a clinical setting to screen gait and functional mobility in Italian older persons. In particular, we intended to verify the capability of IMUs to discriminate individuals with and without cognitive impairments and assess the existence of significant correlations between mobility parameters extracted by processing trunk accelerations and cognitive status. Methods This is a cross-sectional study performed on 213 adults aged over 65 years (mean age 77.0 +/- 5.4; 62% female) who underwent cognitive assessment (through Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised, ACE-R) instrumental gait analysis and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test carried out using a wearable IMU located in the lower back. Results Individuals with cognitive impairments exhibit a peculiar gait pattern, characterized by significant reduction of speed (- 34% vs. healthy individuals), stride length (- 28%), cadence (- 9%), and increase in double support duration (+ 11%). Slight, but significant changes in stance and swing phase duration were also detected. Poorer performances in presence of cognitive impairment were observed in terms of functional mobility as overall and sub-phase TUG times resulted significantly higher with respect to healthy individuals (overall time, + 38%, sub-phases times ranging from + 22 to + 34%), although with some difference associated with age. The severity of mobility alterations was found moderately to strongly correlated with the ACE-R score (Spearman's rho = 0.58 vs. gait speed, 0.54 vs. stride length, 0.66 vs. overall TUG time). Conclusion The findings obtained in the present study suggest that wearable IMUs appear to be an effective solution for the clinical assessment of mobility parameters of older persons screened for cognitive impairments within a clinical setting. They may represent a useful tool for the clinician in verifying the effectiveness of interventions to alleviate the impact of mobility limitations on daily life in cognitively impaired individuals.

TI  - Analysis of Smart Lung Tumour Detector and Stage Classifier Using Deep Learning Techniques with Internet of Things

KW  - MODEL
AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a developing technology in medical applications that assists physicians in making more informed decisions regarding patients' courses of treatment, has become increasingly widespread in recent years in the field of healthcare. On the other hand, the number of PET scans that are being performed is rising, and radiologists are getting significantly overworked as a result. As a direct result of this, a novel approach that goes by the name "computer-aided diagnostics" is now being investigated as a potential method for reducing the tremendous workloads. A Smart Lung Tumor Detector and Stage Classifier (SLD-SC) is presented in this study as a hybrid technique for PET scans. This detector can identify the stage of a lung tumour. Following the development of the modified LSTM for the detection of lung tumours, the proposed SLD-SC went on to develop a Multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) for the classification of the various stages of lung cancer. This network was then modelled and validated utilising standard benchmark images. The suggested SLD-SC is now being evaluated on lung cancer pictures taken from patients with the disease. We observed that our recommended method gave good results when compared to other tactics that are currently being used in the literature. These findings were outstanding in terms of the performance metrics accuracy, recall, and precision that were assessed. As can be shown by the much better outcomes that were achieved with each of the test images that were used, our proposed method excels its rivals in a variety of respects. In addition to this, it achieves an average accuracy of 97 percent in the categorization of lung tumours, which is much higher than the accuracy achieved by the other approaches.

AB  - Introduction: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the most common form of dementia for those under 60 years of age. Increasing numbers of therapeutics targeting FTLD syndromes are being developed.
   Methods: In March 2018, the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration convened the Frontotemporal Degeneration Study Group meeting in Washington, DC, to discuss advances in the clinical science of FTLD.
   Results: Challenges exist for conducting clinical trials in FTLD. Two of the greatest challenges are (1) the heterogeneity of FTLD syndromes leading to difficulties in efficiently measuring treatment effects and (2) the rarity of FTLD disorders leading to recruitment challenges.
   Discussion: New personalized endpoints that are clinically meaningful to individuals and their families should be developed. Personalized approaches to analyzing MRI data, development of new fluid biomarkers and wearable technologies will help to improve the power to detect treatment effects in FTLD clinical trials and enable new, clinical trial designs, possibly leveraged from the experience of oncology trials. A computational visualization and analysis platform that can support novel analyses of combined clinical, genetic, imaging, biomarker data with other novel modalities will be critical to the success of these endeavors.

AB  - In this study, a wearable prototype system was developed for multiple-gesture rehabilitation using electrical stimulation controlled by a volitional surface electromyography (sEMG) scan of a healthy forearm. The purpose of the prototype system is to reconstruct multiple gestures of a paralysed limb and to simplify the positioning of sEMG detection sites on a healthy forearm. A self-designed eight-channel sEMG detection armband was used to detect the sEMG signal distributions of the muscle groups in healthy forearms. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to classify the sEMG signal distributions corresponding to different gestures, and then the classification results were mapped to corresponding stimulation channels. The sEMG signal with the maximum root mean square (RMS) was used as the source of stimulus coding for each gesture. Our proposed mean absolute value (MAV)/number of slope sign changes (NSS) dual-coding (MNDC) algorithm was used to encode the sEMG signal into an electrical stimulus with a dynamic pulse width and frequency. The constant-current stimulation armband electrically stimulated multiple muscles in the affected forearm by means of a circuit designed with a time-division multiplexed stimulation channel. An experiment involving 6 able-bodied volunteers showed that when the detection armband was located near the middle of the forearm, the gesture classification accuracy was greater than 90%, and each active sEMG signal was high. Gesture bridge experiments, including grasping, wrist flexion, wrist extension and finger extension, were carried out among six hemiplegic subjects and between one able-bodied volunteer acting as a controller and each of six stroke patients as the controllee. Both sets of results show that the proposed system can reconstruct these four gestures in the controlled subject with a delay of at most 360 ms and with a correlation coefficient of >0.72.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) systematic screening studies have not shown a clear usefulness in stroke prevention, as AF might present as paroxysmal and asymptomatic. This study aims to determine the usefulness of some blood-biomarkers to identify paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the context of a screening programme. Methods: A total of 100 subjects aged 65-75 years with hypertension and diabetes were randomly selected. AF was assessed by conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) and 4 weeks monitoring with a wearable Holter device (Nuubo (TM)). N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), apolipoprotein CIII (ApoC-III), von Willebrand factor (vWF), ADAMTS13, urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (uPAR), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) were determined in serum/plasma samples and the levels were compared depending on AF presence and mode of detection. Results: The AF prevalence in the studied population was found to be 20%. In seven subjects, AF was only detected after 1 month of Holter monitoring (hAF group). NT-proBNP levels were higher in subjects with AF compared with subjects with no AF (p < 0.0001), even when only taking into account the hAF group (p = 0.031). No significant differences were found in the other biomarkers. The NT-proBNP >95 pg/ml cut-off showed high sensitivity and specificity to detect AF (95%, 66.2%) or hAF (85.72%, 66.2%) and was found to be an independent predictor of AF and hAF in a logistic regression analysis. NT-proBNP correlated with AF burden (r = 0.597, p = 0.024). Conclusion: NT-proBNP was elevated in AF cases not identified by ECG; thus, it may be used as a screening biomarker in asymptomatic high-risk populations, with a promising cut-off point of 95 pg/ml that requires further validation.

AB  - BackgroundPrimary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) reduce mortality in selected patients with severe systolic dysfunction. Current guidelines suggest a 3- to 6-month waiting period before implantation.
   MethodsWe retrospectively studied 29 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) who underwent primary prevention ICD implantation within 6 months of diagnosis between January 2008 and April 2014. Cardiac MRI (CMR) evaluated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and regional fibrosis preimplant. The primary end point was failure to qualify for an ICD at 12 months postimplant, either due to LVEF 35% or deterioration necessitating mechanical support or transplantation, without appropriate ICD therapy. Secondary end points were appropriate and inappropriate ICD therapy.
   ResultsBaseline mean age was 44.2 14.8 years and median LVEF 16.4%. Median time from diagnosis to implant was 32 days. At 12 months, 17 patients (58.6%) no longer qualified for an ICD, mainly due to LVEF improvement. At follow-up (mean 32.0 +/- 20.6 months), three patients received appropriate therapy (one for ventricular fibrillation). All three had CMR late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) preimplant. Cardiac resynchronization at implant predicted LVEF improvement.
   ConclusionEarly appropriate therapy, particularly for ventricular fibrillation, is infrequent for patients with very severe NICM who have ICDs implanted within 6 months of diagnosis. The majority of these patients would not qualify for an ICD at 12 months postinsertion. In the absence of a multimodality risk score, early ICD insertion should only be considered in selected cases (presence of LGE and NSVT). Wearable cardioverter defibrillators may have a role as a bridge to ICD decision.

AB  - Living longer and healthier is the wish of all patients. Therefore, to design effective solutions for this objective, the concept of Big Data in the health field can be integrated. Our work proposes a patient monitoring system based on Internet of Things (IoT) and a diagnostic prediction tool for diabetic patients. This system provides real-time blood glucose readings and information on blood glucose levels. It monitors blood glucose levels at regular intervals. The proposed system aims to prevent high blood sugar and significant glucose fluctuations. The system provides a precise result. The collected and stored data will be classified by using several classification algorithms to predict glucose levels in diabetic patients. The main advantage of this system is that the blood glucose level is reported instantly; it can be lowered or increased.

AB  - Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) screening is endorsed by certain guidelines for individuals aged >= 65 years. Yet many AF screening strategies exist, including the use of wrist-worn wearable devices, and their comparative effectiveness is not well-understood. Methods and Results We developed a decision-analytic model simulating 50 million individuals with an age, sex, and comorbidity profile matching the United States population aged >= 65 years (ie, with a guideline-based AF screening indication). We modeled no screening, in addition to 45 distinct AF screening strategies (comprising different modalities and screening intervals), each initiated at a clinical encounter. The primary effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life-years, with incident stroke and major bleeding as secondary measures. We defined continuous or nearly continuous modalities as those capable of monitoring beyond a single time-point (eg, patch monitor), and discrete modalities as those capable of only instantaneous AF detection (eg, 12-lead ECG). In total, 10 AF screening strategies were effective compared with no screening (300-1500 quality-adjusted life-years gained/100 000 individuals screened). Nine (90%) effective strategies involved use of a continuous or nearly continuous modality such as patch monitor or wrist-worn wearable device, whereas 1 (10%) relied on discrete modalities alone. Effective strategies reduced stroke incidence (number needed to screen to prevent a stroke: 3087-4445) but increased major bleeding (number needed to screen to cause a major bleed: 1815-4049) and intracranial hemorrhage (number needed to screen to cause intracranial hemorrhage: 7693-16 950). The test specificity was a highly influential model parameter on screening effectiveness. Conclusions When modeled from a clinician-directed perspective, the comparative effectiveness of population-based AF screening varies substantially upon the specific strategy used. Future screening interventions and guidelines should consider the relative effectiveness of specific AF screening strategies.

AB  - We develop an autonomous system to detect and evaluate physical therapy exercises using wearable motion sensors. We propose the multi-template multi-match dynamic time warping (MTMM-DTW) algorithm as a natural extension of DTW to detect multiple occurrences of more than one exercise type in the recording of a physical therapy session. While allowing some distortion (warping) in time, the algorithm provides a quantitative measure of similarity between an exercise execution and previously recorded templates, based on DTW distance. It can detect and classify the exercise types, and count and evaluate the exercises as correctly/incorrectly performed, identifying the error type, if any. To evaluate the algorithm's performance, we record a data set consisting of one reference template and 10 test executions of three execution types of eight exercises performed by five subjects. We thus record a total of 120 and 1200 exercise executions in the reference and test sets, respectively. The test sequences also contain idle time intervals. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 93.46% for exercise classification only and 88.65% for simultaneous exercise and execution type classification. The algorithm misses 8.58% of the exercise executions and demonstrates a false alarm rate of 4.91%, caused by some idle time intervals being incorrectly recognized as exercise executions. To test the robustness of the system to unknown exercises, we employ leave-one-exercise-out cross validation. This results in a false alarm rate lower than 1%, demonstrating the robustness of the system to unknown movements. The proposed system can be used for assessing the effectiveness of a physical therapy session and for providing feedback to the patient. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Methods for measuring of eating behavior (known as meal microstructure) often rely on manual annotation of bites, chews, and swallows on meal videos or wearable sensor signals. The manual annotation may be time consuming and erroneous, while wearable sensors may not capture every aspect of eating (e.g. chews only). The aim of this study is to develop a method to detect and count bites and chews automatically from meal videos. The method was developed on a dataset of 28 volunteers consuming unrestricted meals in the laboratory under video observation. First, the faces in the video (regions of interest, ROI) were detected using Faster R-CNN. Second, a pre-trained AlexNet was trained on the detected faces to classify images as a bite/no bite image. Third, the affine optical flow was applied in consecutively detected faces to find the rotational movement of the pixels in the ROIs. The number of chews in a meal video was counted by converting the 2-D images to a 1-D optical flow parameter and finding peaks. The developed bite and chew count algorithm was applied to 84 meal videos collected from 28 volunteers. A mean accuracy (+/- STD) of 85.4% (+/- 6.3%) with respect to manual annotation was obtained for the number of bites and 88.9% (+/- 7.4%) for the number of chews. The proposed method for an automatic bite and chew counting shows promising results that can be used as an alternative solution to manual annotation.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is thought to affect almost 1 billion people worldwide. OSA has well established cardiovascular and neurocognitive sequelae, although the optimal metric to assess its severity and/or potential response to therapy remains unclear. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is well established; thus, we review its history and predictive value in various different clinical contexts. Although the AHI is often criticized for its limitations, it remains the best studied metric of OSA severity, albeit imperfect. We further review the potential value of alternative metrics including hypoxic burden, arousal intensity, odds ratio product, and cardiopulmonary coupling. We conclude with possible future directions to capture clinically meaningful OSA endophenotypes including the use of genetics, blood biomarkers, machine/deep learning and wearable technologies. Further research in OSA should be directed towards providing diagnostic and prognostic information to make the OSA diagnosis more accessible and to improving prognostic information regarding OSA consequences, in order to guide patient care and to help in the design of future clinical trials.

AB  - Anatomically, oral cavity and central nervous system have a close relationship; the mouth and face are the location for 30-40 of the body's sensory and motor nerves. The identification of orofacial manifestations of neurological disorders is usually in direct relation with the responsibilities of a dental surgeon. Therefore, familiarizing dental surgeons with theses manifestations is essential to have better recognition, diagnosis, and correct decisions upon treating their associated Neurological Disorders. These manifestations should be efficiently analyzed using novel effective techniques since their related neurological disorders need to be early identified to avoid serious consequences. Furthermore, preventive dental care for patients with neurological disorders and all kind of rehabilitative treatments necessitates well-planned and effective novel approaches. The Internet of Medical Thing (IoMT) is a relatively new technology that allows the transfer of medical data over a secure network of medical sensors and wearable devices. The data transferred are of utmost importance in diseases diagnosis and treatment. In this paper, an IoMT-based Intelligent Guided Particle Local Search with Optimized Neural Networks (IGPLONN) approach is proposed. Firstly, dental data are collected from the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting (ICCR) oral cavity and central nervous system. Secondly, features are extracted from data and IGPLONN algorithm is utilized to select the effective features by minimizing the feature dimension that helps improve the overall prediction rate. Finally, the obtained features are transferred to the central health application through the IoMT platform where they can be analyzed by dental practitioners for neurological disorders prediction. The hybrid optimized technique improves the overall oral-linked neurological diseases detection rate. Moreover, it efficiently manages the forecast parameters that are used to predict the dental metastasis with minimum computational complexity. The performance of the proposed system has been experimentally evaluated on MATLAB to verify its excellence. The results revealed that proposed IoMT-based IGPLONN method attains the maximum accuracy of 98.3% compared to other methods.

AB  - Gait is a core motor function and is impaired in numerous neurological diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Treatment changes in PD are frequently driven by gait assessments in the clinic, commonly rated as part of the Movement Disorder Society (MDS) Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) assessment (item 3.10). We proposed and evaluated a novel approach for estimating severity of gait impairment in Parkinson's disease using a computer vision-based methodology. The system we developed can be used to obtain an estimate for a rating to catch potential errors, or to gain an initial rating in the absence of a trained clinician-for example, during remote home assessments. Videos (n=729) were collected as part of routine MDS-UPDRS gait assessments of Parkinson's patients, and a deep learning library was used to extract body key-point coordinates for each frame. Data were recorded at five clinical sites using commercially available mobile phones or tablets, and had an associated severity rating from a trained clinician. Six features were calculated from time-series signals of the extracted key-points. These features characterized key aspects of the movement including speed (step frequency, estimated using a novel Gamma-Poisson Bayesian model), arm swing, postural control and smoothness (or roughness) of movement. An ordinal random forest classification model (with one class for each of the possible ratings) was trained and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. Step frequency point estimates from the Bayesian model were highly correlated with manually labelled step frequencies of 606 video clips showing patients walking towards or away from the camera (Pearson's r=0.80, p<0.001). Our classifier achieved a balanced accuracy of 50% (chance = 25%). Estimated UPDRS ratings were within one of the clinicians' ratings in 95% of cases. There was a significant correlation between clinician labels and model estimates (Spearman's rho=0.52, p<0.001). We show how the interpretability of the feature values could be used by clinicians to support their decision-making and provide insight into the model's objective UPDRS rating estimation. The severity of gait impairment in Parkinson's disease can be estimated using a single patient video, recorded using a consumer mobile device and within standard clinical settings; i.e., videos were recorded in various hospital hallways and offices rather than gait laboratories. This approach can support clinicians during routine assessments by providing an objective rating (or second opinion), and has the potential to be used for remote home assessments, which would allow for more frequent monitoring.

AB  - Background The development of wearable health monitoring systems is garnering tremendous interest in research, technology and commercial applications. Their ability of providing unique capabilities in continuous, real-time, and non-invasive tracking of the physiological markers of users can provide insights into the performance and health of individuals. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are of particular interest, as cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally. Monitoring heart health and its conditions such as ventricular disturbances and arrhythmias can be achieved through evaluating various features of ECG such asR-peaks, QRS complex,T-wave, andP-wave. Despite recent advances in biosensors for wearable applications, most of the currently available solutions rely solely on a single system attached to the body, limiting the ability to obtain reliable and multi-location biosignals. However, in engineering systems, sensor fusion, which isthe optimal integration and processing of data from multiple sensors, has been a common theme and should be considered for wearables. In recent years, due to an increase in the availability and variety of different types of sensors, the possibility of achieving sensor fusion in wearable systems has become more attainable. Sensor fusion in multi-sensing systems results in significant enhancements of information inferences compared to those from systems with a sole sensor. One step towards the development of sensor fusion for wearable health monitoring systems is the accessibility to multiple reliable electrophysiological signals, which can be recorded continuously. Results In this paper, we develop a textile-based multichannel ECG band that has the ability to measure ECG from multiple locations on the waist. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that ECG signals can be reliably obtained from different locations on the waist where the shape of the QRS complex is nearly comparable with recordings from the chest using traditional gel electrodes. In addition, we develop a probabilistic approach-based onpredictionandupdatestrategies-to detectR-peaks from noisy textile data in different statuses, including sitting, standing, and jogging. In this approach, an optimal search method is utilized to detectR-peaks based on the history of the intervals between previously detectedR-peaks. We show that the performance of our probabilistic approach inR-peak detection is significantly better than that based on Pan-Tompkins and optimal-threshold methods. Conclusion A textile-based multichannel ECG band was developed to track the heart rate changes from multiple locations on the waist. We demonstrated that (i) the ECG signal can be detected from different locations on the waist, and (ii) the accuracy of the detectedR-peaks from textile sensors was improved by using our proposed probabilistic approach. Despite the limitations of the textile sensors that might compromise the quality of ECG signals, we anticipate that the textile-based multichannel ECG band can be considered as an effective wearable system to facilitate the development of sensor fusion methodology for pervasive and non-invasive health monitoring through continuous tracking of heart rate variability (HRV) from the waist. In addition, from the commercialization point of view, we anticipate that the developed band has the potential to be integrated into garments such as underwear, bras or pants so that individuals can use it on a daily basis.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the global problems of the current era. According to World Health Organization more than 80% of the people living in metropolitan areas breathe air which exceeds the guideline limits. Particulate matter, the mixture of liquid and solid particles having diameters less than 10 mu m, is one of the important pollutants in the air. The main source of the Particulate matter is mostly burning reactions associated with industry, vehicles and homes. Several studies have shown the lethal impact of particulate matter to public health and environment. The rise of particulate matter amount in air has been linked to several health problems such as not only respiratory diseases but also mortality in infants and heart attacks. Currently, bulky stations which are high-cost and have limited spatial resolution are used to monitor the air quality. In this study we developed an alternative particulate matter measurement system which is portable and low-cost (less than 200 USD) and also integrated with cloud computing. The system allows real time distant monitoring of PM particles with high spatial resolution (meter range). The developed sensor system is able to provide air quality data in correlation with the existing stations (R-2 = 0.87). The statistical comparison between the developed system and the reference methods revealed that two systems produced statistically equal results in detecting the variations of the particulate matter.

AB  - A potential intelligent multifunctional diaper with the integration of flexible sensors and data processing/transmitting units may have the functions of monitoring the urination of babies, detecting the physiological parameters and transmitting the information to the mobile terminal of their parents. Here, we present a battery-free music-driven humidity sensor for an intelligent wearable sensing system in a smart diaper. The working mechanism is based on the coupling of the triboelectric effect and the humidity-sensing process. Driven by baby-acceptable musical sound, the two layers of the device vibrate (resonance effect), and the triboelectric effect generates an electrical output. The output decreases with the increasing humidity, acting as both a power source and humidity-sensing signal. The sensor can be embedded in a diaper to monitor the urination of the baby, and a wireless transmitter is integrated in the system to upload the information. The present results can promote the development of the next generation of self-powered active sensors and expand the scope of battery-free sensing systems.

AB  - We present the use of a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) worn on the thigh to produce stride-by-stride estimates of walking speed and its spatiotemporal determinants (i.e., stride time and stride length). Ten healthy and eight post-stroke individuals completed a 6-min walk test with an 18-camera motion capture system used for ground truth measurements. Subject-specific estimation models were trained to estimate walking speed using the polar radius extracted from phase portraits produced from the IMU-measured thigh angular position and velocity. Consecutive flexion peaks in the thigh angular position data were used to define each stride and compute stride times. Stride-by-stride estimates of walking speed and stride time were then used to compute stride length. In both the healthy and post-stroke cohorts, low error and high consistency were observed for the IMU estimates of walking speed (MAE < 0.035 m/s; ICC > 0.98), stride time (MAE < 30 ms; ICC > 0.97), and stride length (MAE < 0.037 m; ICC > 0.96). This study advances the use of a single wearable sensor to accurately estimate walking speed and its spatiotemporal determinants during both healthy and hemiparetic walking.

AB  - Lung cancer is a lethal disease, and early diagnosis with the aid of biomarkers such as HSP90 alpha protein can certainly assist the doctors to start treatment of patient at the earliest and can save their lives. To analyse the diagnostic value of HSP90 alpha expression in lung cancer patients by collecting data of patients through IoT devices to avoid delay in treatments, a study has been presented in this paper where the significance of HSP90 alpha biomarker is highlighted in early diagnosis of patients suffering from lung cancer. The second objective of the research study is to examine the correlation between the appearance level of HSP90 alpha biomarker and the clinicopathological features of lung cancer. It is also evaluated whether the changes in HSP90 alpha index are indicative or noteworthy before and after surgery of lung cancer patients. An observatory study of 78 patients with lung cancer in Qinhuangdao Hospital is presented in this paper where the samples were collected from June 2018 to March 2020. Their data were collected through IoT devices used in the latest healthcare facilities of the hospital. The ELISA method was utilized to identify the level of plasma HSP90 and to analyse HSP90 levels between the lung cancer group and healthy group of people. The relationship between HSP90 and the clinical pathological features of 78 patients suffering from lung cancer was analysed. An electrochemical luminescence method was used to detect CEA, NSE, SCC, and CYFRA21-1 levels. ROC curve and box plots were used to determine the analytic value of HSP90 and other biomarkers used in lung cancer diagnosis. Forty-two patients with moderate to early stage lung cancer with surgical correction were selected, and paired sample T test was used to analyse HSP90 levels before and after surgery. The plasma HSP90 level of lung cancer patients was quite higher as compared to the group of healthy people as per the values depicted in the research study. Second, HSP90 levels are substantially higher in pathologic type, differentiation degree, stage, and the existence of the lung, liver, and bone metastases (P < 0.05). The level of HSP90 expression was largely impacted by a few factors such as sex, age, smoking, and tumour location (P > 0.05). The ROC value for HSP90 was 0.599, while the area under the curve of HSP90 combined with other four tumour markers was 0.915 in the presented case study, indicating the presence of lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer had statistically significant differences in HSP90 expression levels before and after surgery (P < 0.05). It is concluded that the expression level of plasma HSP90 alpha in lung cancer patients increases remarkably; therefore, HSP90 can be used to monitor presence of lung cancer before and after surgery in the patients.</p>

AB  - Introduction: Wearable monitoring systems for non-invasive multi-channel fetal electrocardiography (fECG) can support fetal surveillance and diagnosis during pregnancy, thus enabling prompt treatment. In these embedded systems, power saving is the key to long-term monitoring. In this regard, the computational burden of signal processing methods implemented for the fECG extraction from the multi-channel trans-abdominal recordings plays a non-negligible role. In this work, a supervised machine-learning approach for the automatic selection of the most informative raw abdominal recordings in terms of fECG content, i.e., those potentially leading to good-quality, non-invasive fECG signals from a low number of channels, is presented and evaluated.Methods: For this purpose, several signal quality indexes from the scientific literature were adopted as features to train an ensemble tree classifier, which was asked to perform a binary classification between informative and non-informative abdominal channels. To reduce the dimensionality of the classification problem, and to improve the performance, a feature selection approach was also implemented for the identification of a subset of optimal features. 10336 5-s long signal segments derived from a real dataset of multi-channel trans-abdominal recordings acquired from 55 voluntary pregnant women between the 21st and the 27th week of gestation, with healthy fetuses, were adopted to train and test the classification approach in a stratified 10-time 10-fold cross-validation scheme. Abdominal recordings were firstly pre-processed and then labeled as informative or non-informative, according to the signal-to-noise ratio exhibited by the extracted fECG, thus producing a balanced dataset of bad and good quality abdominal channels.Results and Discussion: Classification performance revealed an accuracy above 86%, and more than 88% of those channels labeled as informative were correctly identified. Furthermore, by applying the proposed method to 50 annotated 24-channel recordings from the NInFEA dataset, a significant improvement was observed in fetal QRS detection when only the channels selected by the proposed approach were considered, compared with the use of all the available channels. As such, our findings support the hypothesis that performing a channel selection by looking directly at the raw abdominal signals, regardless of the fetal presentation, can produce a reliable measurement of fetal heart rate with a lower computational burden.

AB  - Novel means to minimize treatment delays in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are needed. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope on the chest yield mechanocardiographic (MCG) data. We investigated whether STEMI causes changes in MCG signals which could help to detect STEMI. The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2-90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI.

AB  - Background: Research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition using wearable accelerometer devices. Different studies have used varying numbers and placements for data collection using sensors.
   Objective: This study aims to compare accuracy performance between multiple and variable placements of accelerometer devices in categorizing the type of physical activity and corresponding energy expenditure in older adults. Methods: In total, 93 participants (mean age 72.2 years, SD 7.1) completed a total of 32 activities of daily life in a laboratory setting. Activities were classified as sedentary versus nonsedentary, locomotion versus nonlocomotion, and lifestyle versus nonlifestyle activities (eg, leisure walk vs computer work). A portable metabolic unit was worn during each activity to measure metabolic equivalents (METs). Accelerometers were placed on 5 different body positions: wrist, hip, ankle, upper arm, and thigh. Accelerometer data from each body position and combinations of positions were used to develop random forest models to assess activity category recognition accuracy and MET estimation. Results: Model performance for both MET estimation and activity category recognition were strengthened with the use of additional accelerometer devices. However, a single accelerometer on the ankle, upper arm, hip, thigh, or wrist had only a 0.03-0.09 MET increase in prediction error compared with wearing all 5 devices. Balanced accuracy showed similar trends with slight decreases in balanced accuracy for the detection of locomotion (balanced accuracy decrease range 0-0.01), sedentary (balanced accuracy decrease range 0.05-0.13), and lifestyle activities (balanced accuracy decrease range 0.04-0.08) compared with all 5 placements. The accuracy of recognizing activity categories increased with additional placements (accuracy decrease range 0.15-0.29). Notably, the hip was the best single body position for MET estimation and activity category recognition.
   Conclusions: Additional accelerometer devices slightly enhance activity recognition accuracy and MET estimation in older adults. However, given the extra burden of wearing additional devices, single accelerometers with appropriate placement appear to be sufficient for estimating energy expenditure and activity category recognition in older adults.

AB  - Objective Wearable seizure detection devices could provide more reliable seizure documentation outside the hospital compared to seizure self-reporting by patients, which is the current standard. Previously, during the SeizeIT1 project, we studied seizure detection based on behind-the-ear electroencephalography (EEG). However, the obtained sensitivities were too low for practical use, because not all seizures are associated with typical ictal EEG patterns. Therefore, in this paper, we aim to develop a multimodal automated seizure detection algorithm integrating behind-the-ear EEG and electrocardiography (ECG) for detecting focal seizures. In this framework, we quantified the added value of ECG to behind-the-ear EEG. Methods This study analyzed three multicenter databases consisting of 135 patients having focal epilepsy and a total of 896 seizures. A patient-specific multimodal automated seizure detection algorithm was developed using behind-the-ear/temporal EEG and single-lead ECG. The EEG and ECG data were processed separately using machine learning methods. A late integration approach was applied for fusing those predictions. Results The multimodal algorithm outperformed the EEG-based algorithm in two of three databases, with an increase of 11% and 8% in sensitivity for the same false alarm rate. Significance ECG can be of added value to an EEG-based seizure detection algorithm using only behind-the-ear/temporal lobe electrodes for patients with focal epilepsy.

AB  - Background: Low physical activity levels can negatively affect the health of nurses. Given the low physical activity levels reported by nurses, there is a clear need for brief and economical interventions designed to increase physical activity levels in this population. We developed a web-based intervention that used motivational strategies to increase nurses' physical activity levels. The intervention provided the nurses with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend, or team physical activity challenge.
   Objective: In this parallel-group randomized trial, we examine whether nurses' motivation at baseline predicted changes in objectively measured physical activity levels during the 6-week intervention.
   Methods: The participants were 76 nurses (n=74, 97% female; mean age 46, SD 11 years) randomly assigned to 1 of 3 physical activity challenge conditions: (1) individual, (2) friend, or (3) team. The nurses completed a web-based questionnaire designed to assess motivational regulations for physical activity levels before the intervention and wore a Tractivity activity monitor before and during the 6-week intervention. We analyzed data using multilevel modeling for repeated measures.
   Results: The nurses' physical activity levels increased (linear estimate=10.30, SE 3.15; P=.001), but the rate of change decreased over time (quadratic estimate=-2.06, SE 0.52; P<.001). External and identified regulations (B=-2.08 to 11.55; P=.02 to .04), but not intrinsic and introjected regulations (B=-.91 to 6.29; P=.06 to .36), predicted changes in the nurses' physical activity levels.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that an intervention that incorporates self-monitoring and physical activity challenges can be generally effective in increasing nurses' physical activity levels in the short term. They also suggest that drawing solely on organismic integration theory to predict changes in physical activity levels among the nurses participating in web-based worksite interventions may have been insufficient. Future research should examine additional personal (eg, self-efficacy) and occupational factors (eg, shift length and shift type) that influence physical activity levels to identify potential targets for intervention among nurses.

AB  - Background: Many cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are currently on the market claiming that they provide accurate BP measurements. These technologies have considerable potential to improve the awareness, treatment, and management of hypertension. However, recent guidelines by the European Society of Hypertension do not recommend cuffless devices for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Objective: This statement by the European Society of Hypertension Working Group on BP Monitoring and Cardiovascular Variability presents the types of cuffless BP technologies, issues in their validation, and recommendations for clinical practice. Statements: Cuffless BP monitors constitute a wide and heterogeneous group of novel technologies and devices with different intended uses. Cuffless BP devices have specific accuracy issues, which render the established validation protocols for cuff BP devices inadequate for their validation. In 2014, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers published a standard for the validation of cuffless BP devices, and the International Organization for Standardization is currently developing another standard. The validation of cuffless devices should address issues related to the need of individual cuff calibration, the stability of measurements post calibration, the ability to track BP changes, and the implementation of machine learning technology. Clinical field investigations may also be considered and issues regarding the clinical implementation of cuffless BP readings should be investigated. Conclusion: Cuffless BP devices have considerable potential for changing the diagnosis and management of hypertension. However, fundamental questions regarding their accuracy, performance, and implementation need to be carefully addressed before they can be recommended for clinical use.

AB  - Background: Bedrest is toxic for inpatients and consumer grade physical activity monitors offer an economical solution to monitor patient ambulation. But these devices may not be accurate in debilitated hospitalized patients who frequently ambulate very slowly.Objective: To determine whether measures of physical capacity can help identify inpatients for whom wearable physical activity monitors may accurately measure step count.Methods: Prospective observational study of 54 adult inpatients with acute neurological diagnoses. Patients were assessed using 2 physical capacity assessments (Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care Inpatient Mobility Short Form [AM-PAC IMSF] and Katz Activities of Daily Living [ADL] scale). They also completed a 2-minute walk test (2MWT) wearing a consumer grade physical activity monitor.Results: The wearable activity monitor recorded steps (initiated) in 33 (61%) of the inpatients, and for 94% of inpatients with gait speeds >0.43 m/s. Physical capacity assessments correlated well with gait speed, AM-PAC IMSF r = 0.7, and Katz ADL r = 0.6, p < 0.05. When the physical activity monitor initiated, the mean absolute percent error (SD) comparing device calculated steps to observed steps, was 10% (13). AM-PAC IMSF (T-score >45) and Katz ADL (>5) cutoff scores identified inpatients for whom physical activity monitors initiated with a sensitivity of 94 and 91%, respectively.Conclusions: Physical capacity assessments, such as AM-PAC, and Katz ADL, may be a useful and feasible screening strategy to help identify inpatients where wearable physical activity monitors can measure their mobility.(c) 2022 Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisa e Pos-Graduacao em Fisioterapia.

AB  - Background and objective: Duration of rehabilitation and active participation are crucial for gait rehabilitation in the early stage after stroke onset. Virtual reality (VR) is an innovative tool providing engaging and playful environments that could promote intrinsic motivation and higher active participation for non-ambulatory stroke patients when combined with robot-assisted gait training (RAGT). We have developed a new, fully immersive VR application for RAGT, which can be used with a head-mounted display and wearable sensors providing real-time gait motion in the virtual environment. The aim of this study was to validate the use of this new device and assess the onset of cybersickness in healthy participants before testing the device in stroke patients. Materials and Methods: Thirty-seven healthy participants were included and performed two sessions of RAGT using a fully immersive VR device. They physically walked with the Gait Trainer for 20 min in a virtual forest environment. The occurrence of cybersickness, sense of presence, and usability of the device were assessed with three questionnaires: the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), the Presence Questionnaire (PQ), and the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results: All of the participants completed both sessions. Most of the participants (78.4%) had no significant adverse effects (SSQ < 5). The sense of presence in the virtual environment was particularly high (106.42 +/- 9.46). Participants reported good usability of the device (86.08 +/- 7.54). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the usability of our fully immersive VR device for gait rehabilitation and did not lead to cybersickness. Future studies should evaluate the same parameters and the effectiveness of this device with non-ambulatory stroke patients.

TI  - The Feasibility of a Novel Index From a Wireless Doppler Ultrasound Patch to Detect Decreasing Cardiac Output in Healthy Volunteers
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction:
   Early hemorrhage is often missed by traditional vital signs because of physiological reserve, especially in the young and healthy. We have developed a novel, wearable, wireless Doppler ultrasound patch that tracks real-time blood velocity in the common carotid artery.
   Materials and Methods:
   We studied eight healthy volunteers who decreased their cardiac output using a standardized Valsalva maneuver. In all eight, we simultaneously monitored the velocity time integral (VTI) of the common carotid artery (using the ultrasound patch) as well as the descending aorta (using a traditional pulsed wave duplex imaging system); the descending aortic VTI was used as a surrogate for left ventricular stroke volume (SV). Additionally, in a subset of four, we simultaneously measured SV using a noninvasive pulse contour analysis device.
   Results:
   From baseline to peak effect of Valsalva, there was a statistically significant fall in descending aortic and common carotid VTI of 37% (P= 0.0005) and 23% (P < 0.0001), respectively. Both values returned to baseline on recovery. Additionally, a novel index from the carotid ultrasound patch (i.e., the heart rate divided by the carotid artery VTI) detected a 10% fall in aortic VTI with high sensitivity and specificity (100% and 100%, respectively); this novel index also accurately detected a 10% decrease in SV as measured by the noninvasive SV monitor. The mean arterial pressure, measured by the noninvasive pulse contour device, did not correctly detect the fall in SV.
   Conclusion:
   In summary, a novel index from a wireless Doppler ultrasound patch may be more sensitive and specific for detecting decreased cardiac output than standard vital signs in healthy volunteers.

AB  - In modern WBAN (Wireless Body Area Network) applications, wearable sensor nodes are advancing towards in -node detection of cardiovascular diseases with continuous observation of ECG signal. However, a robust power -aware architecture with in-node processing for extraction of cardiac events triggers challenges due to constraints in hardware resources in addition to intensive computational complexity. In this work, a dual mode based transmission system depending on battery-level is discussed that reduces bitstream load of raw ECG signal for saving transmission power. For encoding the bitstream, a power-aware ECG processing architecture is proposed that performs a real-time feature extraction for continuous health monitoring. The proposed architecture ex-plores the advantage of low computationally complex operations focusing on a resource constraint sensor node. The architecture deals with two types of cardiac anomalies i.e., irregular heart rate variation (HRV) and 1st degree AV block; detecting R-peak and P-peak through adaptive thresholding technique. The overall sensitivity and positive predictivity for the proposed algorithm reach upto 99% while validated with the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. The proposed architecture is synthesized in TSMC 90 nm technology node with an esti-mated power consumption of 2.11 mu W, consuming an area overhead of 0.087 mm2. The architecture operates at 1.2 V with an operating frequency of 10 KHz.

AB  - Background: The accurate prediction of blood glucose (BG) level is still a challenge for diabetes management. This is due to various factors such as diet, personal physiological characteristics, stress, and activities influence changes in BG level. To develop an accurate BG level predictive model, we propose a personalized model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a fine-tuning strategy. Methods: We utilized continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) datasets from 1052 professional CGM sessions and split them into three groups according to type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes mellitus (T1DM, T2DM, and GDM, respectively). During the preprocessing, only CGM data points were utilized, and future BG levels of four different prediction horizons (PHs, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min) were used as output. In training, we trained a general CNN and a multi-output random forest regressor using a hold-out method for each group. Next, we developed two personalized models: (1) by fine-tuning the general CNN on partial sample points of each CGM dataset, and (2) by learning a CNN from scratch on the points. Results: For all groups, the fine-tuned CNN showed the lowest average root mean squared error, average mean absolute percentage error, highest average time gain (PH = 15 and 60 min in T1DM) and highest percentage in region A of Clarke error grid analysis at all PHs. In the performance comparison between the fine-tuned CNN and other models, we found that the fine-tuned CNN improved the performance of the general CNN in most cases and outperformed the scratch CNN at all PHs in all groups, making the fine-tuning strategy was useful for accurate BG level prediction. We analyzed all cases of four predictive patterns in each group, and found that the input BG level trend and the BG level at the time of prediction were related to the future BG level trend. Conclusions: We demonstrated the efficacy of the fine-tuning method in a large number of CGM datasets and analyzed the four predictive patterns. Therefore, we believe that the proposed method will significantly contribute to the development of an accurate personalized model and the analysis for its predictions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - ObjectivesThere are concerns regarding the accuracy of step count in Parkinson's disease (PD) when wearable sensors are used. In this study, it was predicted that providing the normal rhythmicity of walking was maintained, the autocorrelation function used to measure step count would provide relatively low errors in step count. Materials and MethodsA total of 21 normal walkers (10 without PD) and 27 abnormal walkers were videoed while wearing a sensor [Parkinson's KinetiGraph (PKG)]. Median step count error rates were observed to be <3% in normal walkers but >= 3% in abnormal walkers. The simultaneous accelerometry data and data from a 6-day PKG were examined and revealed that the 5th percentile of the spectral entropy distribution, among 10-s walking epochs (obtained separately), predicted whether subjects had low error rate on step count with reference to the manual step count from the video recording. Subjects with low error rates had lower Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS III) scores and UPDRS III Q10-14 scores than the high error rate counterparts who also had high freezing of gait scores (i.e., freezing of gait questionnaire). ResultsPeriods when walking occurred were identified in a 6-day PKG from 190 non-PD subjects aged over 60, and 155 people with PD were examined and the 5th percentile of the spectral entropy distribution, among 10-s walking epochs, was extracted. A total of 84% of controls and 72% of people with PD had low predicted error rates. People with PD with low bradykinesia scores (measured by the PKG) had step counts similar to controls, whereas those with high bradykinesia scores had step counts similar to those with high error rates. On subsequent PKGs, step counts increased when bradykinesia was reduced by treatment and decreased when bradykinesia increased. Among both control and people with PD, low error rates were associated with those who spent considerable time making walks of more than 1-min duration. ConclusionUsing a measure of the loss of rhythmicity in walking appears to be a useful method for detecting the likelihood of error in step count. Bradykinesia in subjects with low predicted error in their step count is related to overall step count but when the predicted error is high, the step count should be assessed with caution.

AB  - Background: Home monitoring sensor systems are increasingly used to monitor seniors in their apartments for detection of emergency situations. The aim of this study was to deliver a proof-of-concept for the use of multimodal sensor systems with pervasive computing technology for the detection of clinically relevant health problems over longer time periods.
   Methods: Data were collected with a longitudinal home monitoring study in Switzerland (StrongAge Cohort Study) in a cohort of 24 old and oldest-old, community-dwelling adults over a period of 1 to 2 years. Physical activity in the apartment, toilet visits, refrigerator use, and entrance door openings were quantified using a commercially available passive infrared motion sensing system (Domosafety S.A., Switzerland). Heart rate, respiration rate, and sleep quality were recorded with the commercially available EMFIT QS bed sensor device (Emfit Ltd., Finland). Vital signs and contextual data were collected using a wearable sensor on the upper arm (Everion, Biovotion, Switzerland). Sensor data were correlated with health-related data collected from the weekly visits of the seniors by health professionals, including information about physical, psychological, cognitive, and behavior status, health problems, diseases, medication, and medical diagnoses.
   Results: Twenty of the 24 recruited participants (age 88.9 +/- 7.5 years, 79% females) completed the study; two participants had to stop their study participation because of severe health deterioration, whereas two participants died during the course of the study. A history of chronic disease was present in 12/24 seniors, including heart failure, heart rhythm disturbances, pulmonary embolism, severe insulin-dependent diabetes, and Parkinson's disease. In total, 242,232 person-hours were recorded. During the monitoring period, 963 health status records were reported and repeated clinical assessments of aging-relevant indicators and outcomes were performed. Several episodes of health deterioration, including heart failure worsening and heart rhythm disturbances, could be captured by sensor signals from different sources.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that monitoring of seniors with a multimodal sensor and pervasive computing system over longer time periods is feasible and well-accepted, with a great potential for detection of health deterioration. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the full range of the clinical potential of these findings.

AB  - Monitoring cardiovascular activities plays a critical role in predicting and preventing cardiovascular diseases. Flexible and biosafe sensors that can provide complementary information about cardiovascular activity beyond the traditional electrocardiogram (ECG) are in great demand. Here, a novel eco-friendly in-situ gap-generation method by vaporizing soaked distilled water is developed to fabricate a no-spacer triboelectric nanogenerator (NSTENG). This NSTENG reveals more uniform stress/strain distributions and undergoes larger displacement compared with the traditional TENG with spacer under the same pressure; and it obliterates the obstruction on detection of subtle movements near spacer. The unique fabrication method also guarantees biological safety and avoids air contamination in vivo. The established wireless mobile system based on the NSTENG can precisely detect the full pulse waveforms and display them on the phone screen in real time. By mounting onto the rat's heart, it can monitor normal heart motion and the measured heart rate has an accuracy of up to 99.73%. Moreover, the NSTENG can monitor abnormal heart motion and detect subtle heart movements that fail to be captured by the ECG. This work provides a new strategy that promotes the innovation of biosafe and new structure TENGs, and offers new insights into developing wearable and implantable sensors.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is an ultrasensitive molecular screening technique with greatly enhanced Raman scattering signals from trace amounts of analytes near plasmonic nanostructures. However, research on the development of a sensor that balances signal enhancement, reproducibility, and uniformity has not yet been proposed for practical applications. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of the practical application for detecting or predicting asymptomatic breast cancer from human tears using a portable Raman spectrometer with an identification algorithm based on multivariate statistics. This potentiality was realized through the fabrication of a plasmonic SERS substrate equipped with a well-aligned, gold-decorated, hexagonal-close-packed polystyrene (Au/HCP-PS) nanosphere monolayer that provided femtomole-scale detection, giga-scale enhancement, and <5% relative standard deviation for reliability and reproducibility, regardless of the measuring site. Our results can provide a first step toward developing a noninvasive, real-time screening technology for detecting asymptomatic tumors and preventing tumor recurrence.

AB  - Flexible sensors can be widely used in future wearable devices to monitor people's health states. However, most of the sensors are sensitive to humidity and bending effects, limiting their application in a real-world environment. A new strategy is proposed for obtaining flexible sensors with good tolerance to humidity. By integrating a hydrophobic layer on the surface of doped polyaniline, a flexible sensor that can resist water response with a concentration up to 350 ppm is developed. Good resilience against mechanical bending is also achieved in this flexible sensor. These results may trigger a renaissance in flexible sensor applications for disease diagnosing by wearable devices.

AB  - Wearable biometric monitoring devices (BMDs) and artificial intelligence (Al) enable the remote measurement and analysis of patient data in real time. These technologies have generated a lot of "hype," but their real-world effectiveness will depend on patients' uptake. Our objective was to describe patients' perceptions of the use of BMDs and Al in healthcare. We recruited adult patients with chronic conditions in France from the "Community of Patients for Research" (ComPaRe). Participants (1) answered quantitative and open-ended questions about the potential benefits and dangers of using of these new technologies and (2) participated in a case-vignette experiment to assess their readiness for using BMD5 and Al in healthcare. Vignettes covered the use of Al to screen for skin cancer, remote monitoring of chronic conditions to predict exacerbations, smart clothes to guide physical therapy, and Al chatbots to answer emergency calls. A total of 1183 patients (51% response rate) were enrolled between May and June 2018. Overall, 20% considered that the benefits of technology (e.g., improving the reactivity in care and reducing the burden of treatment) greatly outweighed the dangers. Only 3% of participants felt that negative aspects (inadequate replacement of human intelligence, risks of hacking and misuse of private patient data) greatly outweighed potential benefits. We found that 35% of patients would refuse to integrate at least one existing or soon-to-be available intervention using BMD5 and Al-based tools in their care. Accounting for patients' perspectives will help make the most of technology without impairing the human aspects of care, generating a burden or intruding on patients' lives.

AB  - Recent advances in wearable and/or biomedical sensing technologies have made it possible to record very long-term, continuous biomedical signals, referred to as biomedical intensive longitudinal data (ILD). To link ILD to clinical applications, such as personalized healthcare and disease prevention, the development of robust and reliable data analysis techniques is considered important. In this review, we introduce multiscale analysis methods for and the applications to two types of intensive longitudinal biomedical signals, heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous physical activity (SPA) time series. It has been shown that these ILD have robust characteristics unique to various multiscale complex systems, and some parameters characterizing the multiscale complexity are in fact altered in pathological states, showing potential usability as a new type of ambient diagnostic and/or prognostic tools. For example, parameters characterizing increased intermittency of HRV are found to be potentially useful in detecting abnormality in the state of the autonomic nervous system, in particular the sympathetic hyperactivity, and intermittency parameters of SPA might also be useful in evaluating symptoms of psychiatric patients with depressive as well as manic episodes, all in the daily settings. Therefore, multiscale analysis might be a useful tool to extract information on clinical events occurring at multiple time scales during daily life and the underlying physiological control mechanisms from biomedical ILD.

AB  - Transparency, defined as the ability of a robot to exert nil interaction force on the user, is a key requirement for any wearable robot for assistance, rehabilitation, or functional augmentation. In this study, we propose a new controller to improve the transparency of a powered orthosis. The proposed controller takes advantage of the cyclic nature of human walking to predict the upcoming undesired interaction forces and compensate them in real time. Results from validation tests with a group of N = 12 healthy subjects who walked with a powered ankle-foot orthosis indicate that the proposed controller can reduce undesired interaction torques by 19.1% at slow speed and 17.43% at fast speed, compared to a conventional zero-torque controller. When the same controller was implemented in a semiactive actuation mode, these figures increased to 20.06% and 19.59%, respectively, proving the versatility of the proposed approach.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most dangerous and costly complications of diabetes, accounting for approximately 50% of deaths in diabetic individuals under 24 years. This results in over 130,000 hospital admissions yearly and costs the USA over USD 2.4 billion annually. Earlier diagnosis, treatment, and management of DKA are of critical importance to achieving better patient outcomes and preventing prolonged hospital admissions. Diabetic patients undergoing stress from illness or injury may not recognize early ketosis and often present advanced ketoacidosis, requiring intensive care admission. We have recently developed a microneedle-based technology to extract dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) from both animals and humans, which could enable wearable sensors to rapidly detect ketosis. Metabolite concentrations in ISF may differ in urine and blood and could likely represent local metabolic conditions in the surrounding tissue. Development of a wearable ketone detector will require an understanding of ketone concentrations and kinetics in ISF. Here, we report data that is first of its kind, with regard to the ketone concentrations present in the dermal ISF of rats, their correlation to blood, and the possible impact on the development of a wearable ISF "early warning system" to prevent morbidity from DKA. We extracted ISF, using minimally invasive microneedle arrays, from control Sprague Dawley rats and 17 h fasted rats. ISF and blood ketone levels were measured using a common glucose/ketone meter and strips. Local tissue concentrations of glucose were similar to those of blood, with an average blood to ISF glucose ratio of 0.99 +/- 0.15 mg/dL. ISF ketones (0.4 +/- 0.3 mM) were significantly higher (p = 4.2 x 10(-9)), compared with blood ketones (0.0 +/- 0.0 mM). Although the fasted animals had slightly higher ISF ketones (1.3 +/- 1.1 mM) compared with blood ketones (1.0 +/- 1.0 mM), the difference was not significant (p = 0.3). This suggests ISF could possibly be useful as a surrogate for blood when determining ketone levels within a clinical setting.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach to wearable hand gesture recognition and finger angle estimation based on the modified barometric pressure sensing. Barometric pressure sensors were encased and injected with VytaFlex rubber such that the rubber directly contacted the sensing element allowing pressure change detection when the encasing rubber was pressed. A wearable prototype consisting of an array of ten modified barometric pressure sensors around the wrist was developed and validated with experimental testing for three different hand gesture sets and finger flexion/extension trials for each of the five fingers. The overall hand gesture recognition classification accuracy was 94%. Further analysis revealed that the most important sensor location was the underside of the wrist and that when reducing the sensor number to only five optimally placed sensors, classification accuracy was still 90%. For continuous finger angle estimation, aggregate R-2 values between actual and predicted angles were thumb: 0.81 +/- 0.10, index finger: 0.85 +/- 0.06, middle finger: 0.77 +/- 0.08, ring finger: 0.77 +/- 0.12, and pinkie finger: 0.75 +/- 0.10, and the overall average was 0.79 +/- 0.05. These results demonstrate that a modified barometric pressure wristband can be used to classify hand gestures and to estimate individual finger joint angles. This approach could serve to improve the clinical treatment for upper extremity deficiencies, such as for stroke rehabilitation, by providing objective patient motor control metrics to inform and aid physicians and therapists throughout the rehabilitation process.

AB  - Over the years, environmental changes have made people focus their attention on the quality of their surrounding areas and work environment. However, there are some dangerous substances in areas suitable for human survival and work. People often ignore harmful substances in the air (e.g., substances determined by temperature and humidity, carbon dioxide, and other harmful gases), resulting in physical problems. These substances are often too small to be observed and will severely jeopardize a human body that has been long fixed in the same place. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assist humans in detecting the presence of hazardous substances in their living and work environments, and to improve such environments through sampling and inspection. Through this effort, humans can survive in a living and working space, and live and work in a comfortable environment. On the basis of the Arduino development edition, in this study, we transfer data to a cloud database through WiFi and combine the cloud database with the heart rate from an electrocardiogram to detect the human heart rate in the work environment to achieve 24 h real-time monitoring at home or in the workplace. By improving the flow field of the interior space, we can further reduce the indoor harmful substance level and optimize human life and work quality. For life and industrial hygiene safety consciousness awakening, in this study, we can promote human safety in the living and work environments by using a sensor to prevent potentially dangerous genetic lesions or derivatives of a disease. In addition, the scope of this study is not limited to the living space of people but extends to factories or other places with harmful substances. In a high-risk work environment, the equipment can be used to conduct risk preanalysis and detection in place of a human to achieve full assessment or environmental improvement, which eliminates the safety concerns of people in the environment.

AB  - Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is generally regarded as the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with morphological changes in brain structures, particularly the hippocampus. However, the indicators for characterizing the deformation of hippocampus in conventional methods are not precise enough and ignore the evolution information with the course of disease.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the temporal evolution pattern of MCI and predict the conversion of MCI to AD by using the multivariate morphometry statistics (MMS) as fine features.
   Methods: First, we extracted MMS features from MRI scans of 64 MCI converters (MCIc), 81 MCI patients who remained stable (MCIs), and 90 healthy controls (HC). To make full use of the time information, the dynamic MMS (DMMS) features were defined. Then, the areas with significant differences between pairs of the three groups were analyzed using statistical methods and the atrophy/expansion were identified by comparing the metrics. In parallel, patch selection, sparse coding, dictionary learning and maximum pooling were used for the dimensionality reduction and the ensemble classifier GentleBoost was used to classify MCIc and MCIs.
   Results: The longitudinal analysis revealed that the atrophy of both MCIc and MCIs mainly distributed in dorsal CA1, then spread to subiculum and other regions gradually, while the atrophy area of MCIc was larger and more significant. And the introduction of longitudinal information promoted the accuracy to 91.76% for conversion prediction.
   Conclusion: The dynamic information of hippocampus holds a huge potential for understanding the pathology of MCI.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is prevalent among type 2 diabetic patients. However, the association between diabetic retinopathy (DR) and AF is controversial.
   Methods: We included 40,500 patients with type 2 diabetes (>= 40 years, mean age 62 +/- 11 years, 53% men) without AF from the Korean National Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2002-2007). Subjects were classified without DR (non-DR, n = 30,178), with DR (DR, n = 8920), and with proliferative DR (PDR, n = 1402).
   Results: During a mean 5.9-year follow-up, 1261 (3.1%) patients were newly diagnosed as having AF (4.9, 6.0, and 8.3 per 1000 person-years in the non-DR, DR, and PDR groups, respectively). In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, patients in the DR and PDR groups had a significantly higher risk of AF than those in the non-DR group (DR group: hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.30; PDR group: HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.13-1.87); p for trend <0.001). The risk of AF increased in patients with DR and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.31-3.96, p < 0.001) and in those with PDR and ESRD (HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.96-5.97, p < 0.001) compared to those without DR and ESRD.
   Conclusions: The presence and severity of DR was significantly associated with the incidence of AF. Also, the presence of ESRD had an impact on the incidence of AF in patients with DR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The free text in electronic health records (EHRs) conveys a huge amount of clinical information about health state and patient history. Despite a rapidly growing literature on the use of machine learning techniques for extracting this information, little effort has been invested toward feature selection and the features' corresponding medical interpretation. In this study, we focus on the task of early detection of anastomosis leakage (AL), a severe complication after elective surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery, using free text extracted from EHRs. We use a bag-of-words model to investigate the potential for feature selection strategies. The purpose is earlier detection of AL and prediction of AL with data generated in the EHR before the actual complication occur. Due to the high dimensionality of the data, we derive feature selection strategies using the robust support vector machine linear maximum margin classifier, by investigating: 1) a simple statistical criterion (leave-one-out-based test); 2) an intensive-computation statistical criterion (Bootstrap resampling); and 3) an advanced statistical criterion (kernel entropy). Results reveal a discriminatory power for early detection of complications after CRC (sensitivity 100%; specificity 72%). These results can be used to develop prediction models, based on EHR data, that can support surgeons and patients in the preoperative decision making phase.

AB  - Background: AMAZFIT(R), a novel wearable electrocardiogram (ECG)-recording system is used for the measurement, acquisition, and storage of single-lead cardiac waveforms for adults. The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of AMAZFIT(R) for diagnosing arrhythmia in older patients. Methods: From May to December 2019, we recruited 291 elderly individuals with an average age of 78 +/- 10 years old, and 41.9% women. All cardiac waveforms were obtained from the AMAZFIT(R) which included limb and chest leads. Two trained technicians reviewed all ECG data to determine cardiac rhythm using standard diagnostic criteria. We evaluated the accuracy of AMAZFIT(R) for identifying arrhythmia by comparing the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios with those of a standard 12-lead ECG. Results: Of the 291 participants, 197 older adults had arrhythmias, including AF (n = 119), first-degree AVB (n = 28), PACs (n = 25), and PVCs (n = 28). Three of these participants had arrhythmias of AF and PVCs. Chest lead data from 100% and limb lead data from 4.7% of the participants were analyzed. An evaluation of AMAZFIT(R) for atrial fibrillation (AF) reported a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV PLR, and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) of 93.28, 95.35, 93.28, 95.35, 20.06, and 0.07%, respectively. AMAZFIT(R) also demonstrated excellent sensitivity for premature atrial contractions (PACs) (84.00%) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) (89.29%). However, the device demonstrated a low sensitivity for first-degree atrioventricular block (32.14%). Conclusions: The AMAZFIT(R) showed significantly higher sensitivity and specificity for AF, PACs, and PVCs. This portable ECG-recording device based on an algorithm has a potential auxiliary diagnostic value for identifying arrhythmia compared with a standard 12-lead ECG device.

AB  - Social networks are the persons surrounding a patient who provide support, circulate information, and influence health behaviors. For patients seen by neurologists, social networks are one of the most proximate social determinants of health that are actually accessible to clinicians, compared with wider social forces such as structural inequalities. We can measure social networks and related phenomena of social connection using a growing set of scalable and quantitative tools increasing familiarity with social network effects and mechanisms. This scientific approach is built on decades of neurobiological and psychological research highlighting the impact of the social environment on physical and mental well-being, nervous system structure, and neuro-recovery. Here, we review the biology and psychology of social networks, assessment methods including novel social sensors, and the design of network interventions and social therapeutics.

AB  - Background: Commercial salmon fishing in Alaska is one of the most dangerous occupations in the United States. Between 1992 and 2008, the average annual industry mortality rate was 128 deaths per 100,000 workers, and despite an increase in industry regulations, there has not been a significant decrease in mortality rate since 2000. Unpredictable fishing openings and fierce competition for limited resources result in periods of intense sleep deprivation and physical strain during the short commercial salmon season in Alaska.
   Objective: We hypothesize that the combined effect of sleep deprivation, intense physical workload, and significant short-term chronic stress may be deleterious to health in both the short-and long-term among commercial salmon drift gillnet fishermen in Alaska. The objective of this protocol is to determine the feasibility of the study design to test this hypothesis.
   Methods: The study design uses mixed methods and includes biometric monitoring consisting of heart rate variability, respiration, and movement data collected via a personal, wearable biometric device. Additional methods include observational data on activity, including duration and quality of sleep, weather, catch, and financial gain, as well as the collection of salivary cortisol. As such, the study will provide a holistic assessment of individual stress on multiple simultaneous timescales: immediately and continuously through the personal wearable biometric device, on the minute-hour level through the multiple daily collections of salivary cortisol, and by the hour-day through the use of participant and environment observational data.
   Results: Data collection was initiated in July 2017 and will extend through August 2019. Initial data collection has indicated that the methods outlined in this protocol are feasible and allow for effective collection of qualitative and quantitative data related to the psychological and physiological impact of Alaska commercial salmon fishing.
   Conclusions: We anticipate that the use of a biometric device will be crucial in establishing measures of stress and physical activity within a population and environment uniquely challenged by physical isolation, strong weather patterns, and the potential for significant financial gain by fishermen. The potential exists for individuals engaged long-term in the fishing industry, through repeated and extended exposure to periods of intense sleep deprivation and chronic stress, to be at increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Background: About 5% of breast cancer cases are metastatic at diagnosis, and 20%-30% of localized breast cancer cases become secondarily metastatic. Patients frequently report many detrimental symptoms related to metastasis and treatments. The physical, biological, psychological, and clinical benefits of physical activity during treatment in patients with localized breast cancer have been demonstrated; however, limited literature exists regarding physical activity and physical activity behavior change in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a 6-month physical activity intervention with activity trackers in patients with metastatic breast cancer (the Advanced stage Breast cancer and Lifestyle Exercise, ABLE Trial). Secondary objectives are to examine the effects of physical activity on physical, psychological, anthropometrics, clinical, and biological parameters.
   Methods: We plan to conduct a single-center, single-arm trial with 60 patients who are newly diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. Patients will receive an unsupervised and personalized 6-month physical activity program that includes an activity tracker Nokia Go and is based on the physical activity recommendation. Patients will be encouraged to accumulate at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. Baseline and 6-month assessments will include anthropometric measures, functional tests (eg, 6-minute walk test and upper and lower limb strength), blood draws, patient-reported surveys (eg, quality of life and fatigue), and clinical markers of tumor progression (eg, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria). Results: Data collection occurred between October 2016 and January 2018, and the results are expected in August 2018.
   Conclusions: The ABLE Trial will be the first study to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of an unsupervised and personalized physical activity intervention performed under real-life conditions with activity trackers in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

AB  - Background: The ratio of the difference between neighboring RR intervals to the length of the preceding RR interval (x%) represents the relative change in the duration between two cardiac cycles. We investigated the diagnostic properties of the percentage of relative RR interval differences equal to or greater than x% (pRRx%) with x% in a range between 0.25% and 25% for the distinction of atrial fibrillation (AF) from sinus rhythm (SR). Methods: We used 1-min ECG segments with RR intervals with either AF (32,141 segments) or SR (32,769 segments) from the publicly available Physionet Long-Term Atrial Fibrillation Database (LTAFDB). The properties of pRRx% for different x% were analyzed using the statistical procedures and metrics commonly used to characterize diagnostic methods. Results: The distributions of pRRx% for AF and SR differ significantly over the whole studied range of x% from 0.25% to 25%, with particularly outstanding diagnostic properties for the x% range of 1.5% to 6%. However, pRR3.25% outperformed other pRRx%. Firstly, it had one of the highest and closest to perfect areas under the curve (0.971). For pRR3.25%, the optimal threshold for distinction AF from SR was set at 75.32%. Then, the accuracy was 95.44%, sensitivity was 97.16%, specificity was 93.76%, the positive predictive value was 93.85%, the negative predictive value was 97.11%, and the diagnostic odds ratio was 514. The excellent diagnostic properties of pRR3.25% were confirmed in the publicly available MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. In a direct comparison, pRR3.25% outperformed the diagnostic properties of pRR31 (the percentage of successive RR intervals differing by at least 31 ms), i.e., so far, the best single parameter differentiating AF from SR. Conclusions: A family of pRRx% parameters has excellent diagnostic properties for AF detection in a range of x% between 1.5% and 6%. However, pRR3.25% outperforms other pRRx% parameters and pRR31 (until now, probably the most robust single heart rate variability parameter for AF diagnosis). The exquisite pRRx% diagnostic properties for AF and its simple computation make it well-suited for AF detection in modern ECG technologies (mobile/wearable devices, biopatches) in long-term monitoring. The diagnostic properties of pRRx% deserve further exploration in other databases with AF.

AB  - Shape memory alloy (SMA) wires are excellent candidates for wearable actuators since they are thin, low weight and have a high actuation force. The main drawbacks are that the wire should be kept straight and needs to be relatively long to enable a large enough actuation stroke. Embedding the SMA wire in a flexible tube largely enhances its applicability since then the counter forces are transferred by the tube material and the tube can be rolled up or attached to flexible surfaces or clothing layers. The performance of such tube-guided SMA actuators is, however, more complicated since it not only depends on the SMA behaviour but also on the tube materials and the actuator construction.In this research, a simple end-state model for a tube-guided SMA actuator system is proposed. We measure and model both the SMA and tube material properties, including tube creep effects, and derive an approximate prediction for the actuator stroke. Validation experiments showed that the predicted stroke during the second heating and cooling experiments agreed well with the measurements and that the average deviation is 9.6%, even though the deviation is much larger (27.3%) for the maximum applied force.

TI  - First clinical use of a bioprosthetic total artificial heart: report of two cases

AB  - Background The development of artificial hearts in patients with end-stage heart disease have been confronted with the major issues of thromboembolism or haemorrhage. Since valvular bioprostheses are associated with a low incidence of these complications, we decided to use bioprosthetic materials in the construction of a novel artificial heart (C-TAH). We report here the device characteristics and its first clinical applications in two patients with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy. The aim of the study was to evaluate safety and feasibility of the CARMAT TAH for patients at imminent risk of death from biventricular heart failure and not eligible for transplant.
   Methods The C-TAH is an implantable electro-hydraulically actuated pulsatile biventricular pump. All components, batteries excepted, are embodied in a single device positioned in the pericardial sac after excision of the native ventricles. We selected patients admitted to hospital who were at imminent risk of death, having irreversible biventricular failure, and not eligible for heart transplantation, from three cardiac surgery centres in France.
   Findings The C-TAH was implanted in two male patients. Patient 1, aged 76 years, had the C-TAH implantation on Dec 18, 2013; patient 2, aged 68 years, had the implantation on Aug 5, 2014. The cardiopulmonary bypass times for C-TAH implantation were 170 min for patient 1 and 157 min for patient 2. Both patients were extubated within the first 12 postoperative hours and had a rapid recovery of their respiratory and circulatory functions as well as a normal mental status. Patient 1 presented with a tamponade on day 23 requiring re-intervention. Postoperative bleeding disorders prompted anticoagulant discontinuation. The C-TAH functioned well with a cardiac output of 4.8-5.8 L/min. On day 74, the patient died due to a device failure. Autopsy did not detect any relevant thrombus formation within the bioprosthesis nor the different organs, despite a 50-day anticoagulant-free period. Patient 2 experienced a transient period of renal failure and a pericardial effusion requiring drainage, but otherwise uneventful postoperative course. He was discharged from the hospital on day 150 after surgery with a wearable system without technical assistance. After 4 months at home, the patient suffered low cardiac output. A change of C-TAH was attempted but the patient died of multiorgan failure.
   Interpretation This preliminary experience could represent an important contribution to the development of total artificial hearts using bioprosthetic materials.

AB  - Background: Deficits in gait and balance are common among neurological inpatients. Currently, assessment of these patients is mainly subjective. New assessment options using wearables may provide complementary and more objective information.
   Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional feasibility study performed over a four-month period, all patients referred to a normal neurology ward of a university hospital and aged between 40 and 89 years were asked to participate. Gait and balance deficits were assessed with wearables at the ankles and the lower back. Frailty, sarcopenia, Parkinsonism, depression, quality of life, fall history, fear of falling, physical activity, and cognition were evaluated with questionnaires and surveys.
   Results: Eighty-two percent (n = 384) of all eligible patients participated. Of those, 39% (n = 151) had no gait and balance deficit, 21% (n = 79) had gait deficits, 11% (n = 44) had balance deficits and 29% (n = 110) had gait and balance deficits. Parkinson's disease, stroke, epilepsy, pain syndromes, and multiple sclerosis were the most common diseases. The assessment was well accepted.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that the use of wearables for the assessment of gait and balance features in a clinical setting is feasible. Moreover, preliminary results confirm previous epidemiological data about gait and balance deficits among neurological inpatients. Evaluation of neurological inpatients with novel wearable technology opens new opportunities for the assessment of predictive, progression and treatment response markers.

AB  - Lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton robots connect with the human body in a wearable way and control the movement of joints in the gait rehabilitation process. Among treadmill-based lower limb rehabilitation exoskeleton robots, Lokomat (Hocoma AG, Volketswil, Switzerland) has 4 actuated joints for bilateral hips and knees whereas Walkbot (P&S Mechanics, Seoul, Korea) has 6 bilateral actuated joints for bilateral hips, knees, and ankles. Lokomat and Walkbot robotic gait training systems have not been directly compared previously. The present study aimed to directly compare Lokomat and Walkbot robots in non-ambulatory chronic patients with acquired brain injury (ABI). The authors conducted a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study of 62 subjects with ABI who were admitted to the rehabilitation hospital. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Lokomat (n = 28) and Walkbot (n = 34). Patients were subjected to robot-assisted gait training (RAGT) combined with conventional physical therapy for a total of 14 (8-36) median (interquartile range) sessions. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, lag time post-injury, ABI type, paralysis type, intervention sessions, lower extremity strength, spasticity, and cognitive function were assessed. Functional ambulation category (FAC) and Berg balance scale (BBS) were used for outcome measures. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the groups. Baseline FAC score was 1 (0-2) in Lokomat and 1 (0-1) in Walkbot group. After the intervention, FAC scores improved significantly to 2 (1-3) in both groups (P < .05). Lokomat and Walkbot groups showed significantly enhanced BBS from 5 (2.75-24.25) and 15 (4-26.5) to 15 (4-26.5) and 22 (12-40), respectively (P < .05). Degree of improvements in both group were not significantly different with regard to balance (P = .56) and ambulatory ability (P = .74). This study indicates that both Locomat and Walkbot robotic gait training combined with conventional gait-oriented physiotherapy are promising intervention for gait rehabilitation in patients with chronic stage of ABI who are not able to walk independently.

AB  - Background: The WEAICOR (Wearables to Investigate the Long Term Cardiovascular and Behavioral Impacts of COVID-19) study was a prospective observational study that used continuous monitoring to detect and analyze biometrics. Compliance to wearables was a major challenge when conducting the study and was crucial for the results.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate patients' compliance to wearable wristbands and determinants of compliance in a prospective COVID-19 cohort.
   Methods: The Biostrap (Biostrap USA LLC) wearable device was used to monitor participants' biometric data. Compliance was calculated by dividing the total number of days in which transmissions were sent by the total number of days spent in the WEAICOR study. Univariate correlation analyses were performed, with compliance and days spent in the study as dependent variables and age, BMI, sex, symptom severity, and the number of complications or comorbidities as independent variables. Multivariate linear regression was then performed, with days spent in the study as a dependent variable, to assess the power of different parameters in determining the number of days patients spent in the study.
   Results: A total of 122 patients were included in this study. Patients were on average aged 41.32 years, and 46 (38%) were female. Age was found to correlate with compliance (r=0.23; P=.01). In addition, age (r=0.30; P=.001), BMI (r=0.19; P=.03), and the severity of symptoms (r=0.19; P=.03) were found to correlate with days spent in the WEAICOR study. Per our multivariate analysis, in which days spent in the study was a dependent variable, only increased age was a significant determinant of compliance with wearables (adjusted R-2=0.1; beta=1.6; P=.01).
   Conclusions: Compliance is a major obstacle in remote monitoring studies, and the reasons for a lack of compliance are multifactorial. Patient factors such as age, in addition to environmental factors, can affect compliance to wearables.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible illness of the brain impacting the functional and daily activities of elderly population worldwide. Neuroimaging sensory systems such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) measure the pathological changes in the brain associated with this disorder especially in its early stages. Deep learning (DL) architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successfully used in recognition, classification, segmentation, detection, and other domains for data interpretation. Data augmentation schemes work alongside DL techniques and may impact the final task performance positively or negatively. In this work, we have studied and compared the impact of three data augmentation techniques on the final performances of CNN architectures in the 3D domain for the early diagnosis of AD. We have studied both binary and multiclass classification problems using MRI and PET neuroimaging modalities. We have found the performance of random zoomed in/out augmentation to be the best among all the augmentation methods. It is also observed that combining different augmentation methods may result in deteriorating performances on the classification tasks. Furthermore, we have seen that architecture engineering has less impact on the final classification performance in comparison to the data manipulation schemes. We have also observed that deeper architectures may not provide performance advantages in comparison to their shallower counterparts. We have further observed that these augmentation schemes do not alleviate the class imbalance issue.

AB  - Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point-of-care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self-healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor-based (FET-based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro-stereolithography-based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10 mu m resolution enables the construction of self-healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self-healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10(-16) m in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real-time in vivo analysis of disease-indicative biomarkers, this proof-of-concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self-administrable procedure.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. It increases the risk of stroke, dementia, and death; therefore, its timely diagnosis at an initial stage is crucial. Often wearable mobile devices are recommended for the primary detection of this life-threatening arrhythmia. Irregularity of the heartbeat duration, often measured through R-R intervals (RRI), has been intensively investigated during the past four decades for automatic detection of AF. However, little improvement has been made when the input signal (RRI tachogram) contains different types of arrhythmic rhythms. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood component analysis (NCA) based linear transformation of a window of RRI tachogram to improve the robustness of AF detection. Several state-of-the-art classification models are trained and tested using transformed signals, and AF detection performance are evaluated using the challenging MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database containing various types of arrhythmic rhythms. The experimental results show significant improvement in AF detection performance using the transformed signals compared to those for signals in the original space and after linear-discriminant-analysis-based transformation. In particular, for the Naive Bayesian classification of the transformed signals, we obtained 98.59% sensitivity, 99.91% specificity, 99.16% positive predictive value, and 99.79% accuracy. The proposed AF detection method outperforms the existing methods reported in the past four decades. Owing to the use of a short window of RRI tachogram (15 consecutive RRIs), the proposed method can be incorporated into a deployable mobile screening device for robust detection of AF.

AB  - Background Diabetes is the leading cause of lower limb amputation in Australia, costing the Australian health care system an estimated A$1.6 billion annually. Podiatrists are the primary foot health care provider in Australia. Research suggests that health professional attitudes can impact patient utilisation of e-health technologies, such as wearable foot monitoring devices aimed at preventing foot ulceration. The aim of this study was to explore factors that impact the intentions of Australian podiatrists to adopt smart insole foot monitoring technology. Methods A mixed methods explanatory sequential design was undertaken. One hundred and eleven Australian podiatrists completed an online version of the validated Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the strongest predictive model of podiatrists' behavioural intention to adopt technology. Additionally, two focus groups were conducted, and thematic analysis was performed to explore podiatrists' perceived barriers and enablers to smart insole adoption. Results One hundred and eleven Australian podiatrists completed the online UTAUT questionnaire. The majority of respondents practiced in the private sector (58.6%) and were female (50.5%), with Victoria the most common practice location (39.6%). Significant positive correlations existed between behavioural intention and six psychosocial domains including performance expectancy (r = 0.64, p < 0.001), effort expectancy (r = 0.47, p < 0.001), attitude (r = 0.55, p < 0.001), social influence (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), facilitating conditions (r = 0.36, p < 0.001), and self-efficacy (r = 0.30, p < 0.002). Multiple regression analysis determined that performance expectancy alone was most predictive of behavioural intention to adopt a smart insole into clinical practice (adjusted R-2 = 42%, p < 0.001). Qualitative analyses revealed that podiatrists believed that the insole would increase patient knowledge, engagement and self-efficacy. However, concerns were raised about cost, footwear issues and the device's utility with elderly and remote populations. Conclusions Performance expectancy was the most important psychosocial factor predicting the intentions of Australian podiatrists to adopt smart insole foot monitoring technologies. While Australian podiatrists are open to adopting smart insoles into clinical practice, evidence of the device's efficacy is a precursor to adoption. Other perceived barriers to adoption including device cost, compatibility with off-loading, footwear issues and patient age also need to be addressed prior to implementation and clinical adoption.

AB  - Background: Saudi Arabia is lagging behind developed countries in devising specific real projects, roadmaps, and policies for the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data adoption despite having a vision for providing the best-quality health care services to its citizens. As a result, Saudi Arabia is going to host an event for the third time, in 2020, promoting the widescale adoption of the IoT. While a nationwide study has identified the risk that many participants were previously undiagnosed for hypertension and other chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia, the application of the IoT and big data technologies could be very useful in minimizing such risks by predicting chronic disease earlier, and on a large scale.
   Materials and Methods: A framework that consists of four modules, (1) data collection, (2) data storage, (3) Hadoop/Spark cluster, and (4) Google Cloud, was developed in which decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) techniques were used for predicting hypertension. There were 140 participants in total and 20% of participants were used for training the model.
   Results: The results show that age and diabetes play a very significant part in diagnosing hypertension in older people. Also, it was found that the possibility of hypertension because of smoking is less than that of diabetes, and older people should have a lower intake of salty food. Moreover, it was found that SVM techniques yielded better results than C4.5 in our study.
   Conclusions: Although it was found that the algorithms examined in this study can be used for disease prediction, the ability to classify and predict disease is not yet sufficiently satisfactory. To achieve this, more training data and a longer duration are required. Finally, by supporting such study for developing custom-made smart wristbands, custom-made smart clothing, and custom-made smart homes that can predict and detect a wide range of chronic diseases, the Saudi government can achieve its health-related goals of Vision 2030.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a method for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals obtained from a wearable device. The proposed method uses three classification methods: neural networks (NNs), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and decision trees (DT). The results from each of the three classifiers are combined using a voting system to make the final decision as to whether AF is present. To develop the classification system, we collected data from 61 subjects using a Nymi Band that is wrist-worn ECG monitoring device. From these signals, we extracted the root-mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD) and the Shannon entropy (ShE) of the RR interval, QS interval, and R peak amplitude. These properties were then used as features to train the classifiers. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision of this classifier were 97.94%, 100.00%, 96.72%, and 94.74%, respectively for dataset with six features. The ensemble method of NNs, kNN, and DT was evaluated. Depending on the rules for ensemble, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision are different among those classifiers. With a rule of unanimous determination for AF, false positive is decreased and false negative is increased. With a rule of unanimous determination for NSR, false positive is increased and false negative decreased. Even though accuracies of each classifier are depending on the set of features, with ensemble method, the accuracy of AF detection can be preserved.

AB  - Background: Longitudinal movement parameter analysis of hemiparetic patients over several months could reveal potential recovery trends and help clinicians adapting therapy strategies to maximize recovery outcome. Wearable sensors offer potential for day-long movement recordings in realistic rehabilitation settings including activities of daily living, e.g., walking. The measurement of walking-related movement parameters of affected and non-affected body sides are of interest to determine mobility and investigate recovery trends.
   Methods: By comparing movement of both body sides, recovery trends across the rehabilitation duration were investigated. We derived and validated selected walking segments from free-living, day-long movement by using rules that do not require data-based training or data annotations. Automatic stride segmentation using peak detection was applied to walking segments. Movement parameters during walking were extracted, including stride count, stride duration, cadence, and sway. Finally, linear regression models over each movement parameter were derived to forecast the moment of convergence between body sides. Convergence points were expressed as duration and investigated in a patient observation study.
   Results: Convergence was analyzed in walking-related movement parameters in an outpatient study including totally 102 full-day recordings of inertial movement data from 11 hemiparetic patients. The recordings were performed over several months in a day-care centre. Validation of the walking extraction method from sensor data yielded sensitivities up to 80 % and specificity above 94 % on average. Comparison of automatically and manually derived movement parameters showed average relative errors below 6 % between affected and non-affected body sides. Movement parameter variability within and across patients was observed and confirmed by case reports, reflecting individual patient behavior.
   Conclusion: Convergence points were proposed as intuitive metric, which could facilitate training personalization for patients according to their individual needs. Our continuous movement parameter extraction and analysis, was feasible for realistic, day-long recordings without annotations. Visualizations of movement parameter trends and convergence points indicated that individual habits and patient therapies were reflected in walking and mobility. Context information of clinical case reports supported trend and convergence interpretation. Inconsistent convergence point estimation suggested individually varying deficiencies. Long-term recovery monitoring using convergence points could support patient-specific training strategies in future remote rehabilitation.

AB  - Background: Undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) exposes unsuspecting patients to elevated stroke risks. The op-timal algorithm for identifying patients who should be screened for AF remains undetermined. The objective of this study is to determine the AF burden in an asymptomatic, at-risk population. We also sought to investigate potential predictors of undiagnosed AF.
   Methods: This registry is a prospective observational study assessing continuous ECG monitoring in screening for AF using a wearable single lead 7-day continuous monitoring device. Patients included were asymptomatic indi-viduals, at risk for AF as determined by either 1) >-65 years of age with >-1 high risk factor or; 2) >-75 years of age and >-2 moderate risk factors. A multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the predictive value of cer-tain patient characteristics in identifying patients susceptible to have undiagnosed AF.
   Results: Among the 942 patients included, 25 patients (2.7%) had evidence of AF detected. Only 8 patients had AF duration >-24 h. History of perioperative AF (OR: 3.25, 95%CI: 1.08-9.79, p = 0.036), age over 85 (OR: 4.71, 95%CI: 1.31-16.92, p = 0.017) and absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR: 0.27, 95%CI: 0.10-0.76, p = 0.013) were found to be predictive of undiagnosed AF.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of office-based AF screening in at-risk population. The low rate of AF detection suggests that the optimal algorithm for identifying asymptomatic patients who would benefit from continuous screening remains unclear. Advanced age, history of perioperative AF and absence of CVD are variables that could be explored further.

AB  - Mixed reality (MR), which combines virtual reality and tangible objects, can be used for repetitive training by patients with stroke, allowing them to be immersed in a virtual environment while maintaining their perception of the real world. We developed an MR-based rehabilitation board (MR-board) for the upper limb, particularly for hand rehabilitation, and aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the MR-board as a self-training rehabilitation tool for the upper extremity in stroke patients. The MR-board contains five gamified programs that train upper-extremity movements by using the affected hand and six differently shaped objects. We conducted five 30-min training sessions in stroke patients using the MR-board. The sensor measured hand movement and reflected the objects to the monitor so that the patients could check the process and results during the intervention. The primary outcomes were changes in the Box and Block Test (BBT) score, and the secondary outcomes were changes in the Fugl-Meyer assessment and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) scores. Evaluations were conducted before and after the intervention. In addition, a usability test was performed to assess the patient satisfaction with the device. Ten patients with hemiplegic stroke were included in the analysis. The BBT scores and shoulder strength in the WMFT were significantly improved (p < 0.05), and other outcomes were also improved after the intervention. In addition, the usability test showed high satisfaction (4.58 out of 5 points), and patients were willing to undergo further treatment sessions. No safety issues were observed. The MR-board is a feasible intervention device for improving upper limb function. Moreover, this instrument could be an effective self-training tool that provides training routines for stroke patients without the assistance of a healthcare practitioner.

AB  - Background and Purpose: We addressed questions about the potential discrepancy between improvements in activity capacity and improvements in activity performance in daily life. We asked whether this discrepancy is:
   1. Common in routine, outpatient care, or an artifact of intervention studies?
   2. Unique to upper limb (UL) rehabilitation, or is it seen in walking rehabilitation too?
   3. Only seen in persons with stroke, or a broader neurorehabilitation problem?
   Methods: A longitudinal, observational cohort of 156 participants with stroke or Parkinson disease (PD) receiving outpatient rehabilitation at 5 clinics was assessed around admission and monthly during their episode of care. Individual, longitudinal capacity (Action Research Arm Test or walking speed) and performance (wearable sensor measurements of use ratio or steps/day) data were modeled to extract predicted change scores. Simulation methods were used to determine whether an individual's change was greater than 1 standard error. Participants were classified into categories based on whether or not they improved in capacity (C+ or C-) and/or performance (P+ or P-).
   Results: A majority (59%) were classified as C+P-. Smaller portions of the sample were classified as C+P+ (20%) and C-P- (21%), with 1 participant (<1%) classified as C-P+. The proportions in the C+P- category were significantly larger in the stroke (chi(2) = 48.7, P < 0.0001) and PD (chi(2) = 24.3, P < 0.0001) walking subgroups than in the stroke UL subgroup.
   Discussion and Conclusions: The discrepancy between improvements in capacity and performance is a problem in routine, outpatient neurorehabilitation. If performance information were available, patients and clinicians could act to address it.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia that may cause blood clots and increase the risk of stroke and heart failure. Traditional 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition equipment is complex and difficult to carry. Short single-lead ECG recordings based on wearable devices can remedy these shortcomings. However, reliable and accurate atrial fibrillation detection is still an issue because of the limited information on the short single-lead ECG recordings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-branch convolutional neural network and bidirectional long short-term memory network (MCNN-BLSTM) to deal with the reliability and accuracy of AF detection in short single-lead ECG recordings. Firstly, to fuller extract the feature information of short single-lead ECG recordings, the MCNN module is designed to dynamically set several corresponding branches according to the number of slices of short single-lead ECG recordings. Then, the BLSTM module is designed to further enhance the feature information learned from each branch. We validated the model on the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 (CinC2017) database and verified the generalization of the model on the China Physiological Signal Challenge 2018 (CPSC2018) database. The results show that the accuracy of the model on the CinC 2017 database reaches 87.57%, and the average F1 score reaches 84.56%. The accuracy of the model on the CPSC 2018 database reaches 87.50%, and the average F1 score reaches 82.01%. Compared with other advanced methods, our model shows better performance and can meet the daily needs of atrial fibrillation detection with short ECG wearable devices.

AB  - Wearable and implantable medical devices are playing more and more key roles in disease diagnosis and health management. Various biosensors and systems have been used for respiration monitoring. Among them, selfpowered sensors have some special characteristics such as low-cost, easy preparation, highly designable, and diversified. The respiratory airflow can drive the self-powered sensors directly to convert mechanical energy of the airflow into electricity. One of the major goals of the self-powered sensors and systems is realizing health monitoring and diagnosis. The relationship between the output signals and the models of respiratory diseases has not been studied deeply and clearly. Therefore, how to find an accurate relationship between them is a challenging and significant research topic. This review summarized the recent progress of the self-powered respiratory sensors and systems from aspects of device principle, output property, detecting index and so on. The challenges and perspectives have also been discussed for reference to the researchers who are interested in the field of self-powered sensors.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in EEG-based wearable classifiers of emotions, which could enable the real-time monitoring of patients suffering from neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), or Alzheimer's. The hope is that such wearable emotion classifiers would facilitate the patients' social integration and lead to improved healthcare outcomes for them and their loved ones. Yet in spite of their direct relevance to neuro-medicine, the hardware platforms for emotion classification have yet to fill up some important gaps in their various approaches to emotion classification in a healthcare context. In this paper, we present the first hardware-focused critical review of EEG-based wearable classifiers of emotions and survey their implementation perspectives, their algorithmic foundations, and their feature extraction methodologies. We further provide a neuroscience-based analysis of current hardware accelerators of emotion classifiers and use it to map out several research opportunities, including multi-modal hardware platforms, accelerators with tightly-coupled cores operating robustly in the near/supra-threshold region, and pre-processing libraries for universal EEG-based datasets.

AB  - Monitoring Ingestive Behavior (MIB) of individuals is of special importance to identify and treat eating patterns associated with obesity and eating disorders. Current methods for MIB require subjects reporting every meal consumed, which is burdensome and tend to increase the reporting bias over time. This study presents an evaluation of the burden imposed by two wearable sensors for MIB during unrestricted food intake: a strain sensor to detect chewing events and a throat microphone to detect swallowing sounds. A total of 30 healthy subjects with various levels of adiposity participated in experiments involving the consumption of four meals in four different visits. A questionnaire was handled to subjects at the end of the last visit to evaluate the sensors burden in terms of the comfort levels experienced. Results showed that sensors presented high comfort levels as subjects indicated that the way they ate their meal was not considerably affected by the presence of the sensors. A statistical analysis showed that chewing sensor presented significantly higher comfort levels than the swallowing sensor. The outcomes of this study confirmed the suitability of the chewing and swallowing sensors for MIB and highlighted important aspects of comfort that should be addressed to obtain acceptable and less burdensome wearable sensors for MIB.

AB  - Objectives: Financial incentive programs are effective in increasing physical activity for overweight, ambulatory adults. We sought to determine the potential effect size and direction of financial incentives on ambulation after radical cystectomy.
   Materials and Methods: We performed a pilot randomized controlled trial of daily financial incentives to meet postoperative step goals among adults with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status <= 2 who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer at a single center. Step counts were measured over a 3- to 14-day preoperative period and 30-day postoperative period using a wearable activity monitor. Postoperative daily step goals of 10%, 25%, 40%, and 55% of mean preoperative daily step counts were set for postoperative weeks 1 through 4, respectively. The primary outcome was the number of postoperative days on which the step goals were met. Secondary outcomes included the number of daily postoperative steps taken and the length of stay. Participants randomized to the intervention arm received $1.50 for every day the goal was met with a 20% chance of a $100 reward if the step goal was met on > 75% of the first 30 postoperative days. Questionnaires assessing self-reported physical activity, disability, and social support were administered preoperatively at 30 days postoperatively.
   Results: Thirty-three patients were analyzed, 11 in the control and 22 in the intervention arms. There were no statistically significant differences between incentive and control arms for the primary outcome (4.5/30 days vs. 9/30 days, P = 0.53). Results after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics were similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24- 4.19, P = 1.00). There were also no differences in average daily postoperative steps (median 979 vs. 1191, 95% CI - 810 to 1,400, P = 0.59), length of stay (7.5 vs. 7, 95% CI - 2.7 to 5.1, P = 0.56), or self-reported measures of disability, activity, and social support.
   Conclusions: While this trial was a pilot study and not powered to detect a difference between groups, there was no suggestion of any clinically important impact of this financial incentive on postoperative ambulation. While a fully-powered trial is feasible, given the small range of plausible benefit, such a trial would be unlikely to influence clinical practice. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Opportunistic screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) is recommended, and improved methods of early identification could allow for the initiation of appropriate therapies to prevent the adverse health outcomes associated with AF.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a self-applied wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) patch in detecting AF and the clinical consequences associated with such a detection strategy.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A direct-to-participant randomized clinical trial and prospective matched observational cohort study were conducted among members of a large national health plan. Recruitment began November 17, 2015, and was completed on October 4, 2016, and 1-year claims-based follow-up concluded in January 2018. For the clinical trial, 2659 individuals were randomized to active home-based monitoring to start immediately or delayed by 4 months. For the observational study, 2 deidentified age-, sex- and CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc-matched controls were selected for each actively monitored individual.
   INTERVENTIONS The actively monitored cohort wore a self-applied continuous ECG monitoring patch at home during routine activities for up to 4 weeks, initiated either immediately after enrolling (n = 1364) or delayed for 4 months after enrollment (n = 1291).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the incidence of a new diagnosis of AF at 4 months among those randomized to immediate monitoring vs delayed monitoring. A secondary end point was new AF diagnosis at 1 year in the combined actively monitored groups vs matched observational controls. Other outcomes included new prescriptions for anticoagulants and health care utilization (outpatient cardiology visits, primary care visits, or AF-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations) at 1 year.
   RESULTS The randomized groups included 2659 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [7.3] years; 38.6% women), of whom 1738 (65.4%) completed active monitoring. The observational study comprised 5214 (mean [SD] age, 73.7 [7.0] years; 40.5% women; median CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, 3.0), including 1738 actively monitored individuals from the randomized trial and 3476 matched controls. In the randomized study, new AF was identified by 4 months in 3.9% (53/1366) of the immediate group vs 0.9% (12/1293) in the delayed group (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% CI, 1.8%-4.1%]). At 1 year, AF was newly diagnosed in 109 monitored (6.7 per 100 person-years) and 81 unmonitored (2.6 per 100 person-years; difference, 4.1 [95% CI, 3.9-4.2]) individuals. Active monitoring was associated with increased initiation of anticoagulants (5.7 vs 3.7 per 100 person-years; difference, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.9-2.2]), outpatient cardiology visits (33.5 vs 26.0 per 100 person-years; difference, 7.5 [95% CI, 7.2-7.9), and primary care visits (83.5 vs 82.6 per 100 person-years; difference, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.4-1.5]). Therewas no difference in AF-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations (1.3 vs 1.4 per 100 person-years; difference, 0.1 [95% CI, -0.1 to 0]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among individuals at high risk for AF, immediate monitoring with a home-based wearable ECG sensor patch, compared with delayed monitoring, resulted in a higher rate of AF diagnosis after 4 months. Monitored individuals, compared with nonmonitored controls, had higher rates of AF diagnosis, greater initiation of anticoagulants, but also increased health care resource utilization at 1 year.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - A number of sensor devices are widely distributed and used today owing to the accelerated development of IoT technology. In particular, this technological advancement has allowed users to carry IoT devices with more convenience and efficiency. Based on the IoT sensor data, studies are being actively carried out to recognize the current situation or to analyze and predict future events. However, research for existing smart healthcare services is focused on analyzing users' behavior from single sensor data and is also focused on analyzing and diagnosing the current situation of the users. Therefore, a method for effectively managing and integrating a large amount of IoT sensor data has become necessary, and a framework considering data interoperability has become necessary. In addition, an analysis framework is needed not only to provide the analysis of the users' environment and situation from the integrated data, but also to provide guide information to predict future events and to take appropriate action by users. In this paper, we propose a prescriptive analysis framework using a 5W1H method based on CKAN cloud. Through the CKAN cloud environment, IoT sensor data stored in individual CKANs can be integrated based on common concepts. As a result, it is possible to generate an integrated knowledge graph considering interoperability of data, and the underlying data is used as the base data for prescriptive analysis. In addition, the proposed prescriptive analysis framework can diagnose the situation of the users through analysis of user environment information and supports users' decision making by recommending the possible behavior according to the coming situation of the users. We have verified the applicability of the 5W1H prescriptive analysis framework based on the use case of collecting and analyzing data obtained from various IoT sensors.

AB  - Background: Physical inactivity is an important modifiable risk factor for chronic diseases. A new wrist-worn heart rate and activity monitor has been developed for unobtrusive data collection to aid prevention and management of lifestyle-related chronic diseases by means of behavioral change programs.
   Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the performance of total energy expenditure and resting heart rate measures of the Philips health watch. Secondary objectives included the assessment of accuracy of other output parameters of the monitor: heart rate, respiration rate at rest, step count, and activity type recognition.
   Methods: A within-person comparative study was performed to assess the performance of the health watch against (medical) reference measures. Participants executed a protocol including 15 minutes of rest and various activities of daily life. A two one-sided tests approach was adopted for testing equivalence. In addition, error metrics such as mean error and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were calculated.
   Results: A total of 29 participants (14 males; mean age 41.2, SD 14.4, years; mean weight 77.2, SD 10.2, kg; mean height 1.8, SD 0.1, m; mean body mass index 25.1, SD 3.1, kg/m(2)) completed the 81-minute protocol. Their mean resting heart rate in beats per minute (bpm) was 64 (SD 7.3). With a mean error of -10 (SD 38.9) kcal and a MAPE of 10% (SD 8.7%), total energy expenditure estimation of the health watch was found to be within the 15% predefined equivalence margin in reference to a portable indirect calorimeter. Resting heart rate determined during a 15-minute rest protocol was found to be within a 10% equivalence margin in reference to a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor, with a mean deviation of 0 bpm and a maximum deviation of 3 bpm. Heart rate was within 10 bpm and 10% of the ECG monitor reference for 93% of the duration of the protocol. Step count estimates were on average 21 counts lower than a waist-mounted step counter over all walking activities combined, with a MAPE of 3.5% (SD 2.4%). Resting respiration rate was on average 0.7 (SD 1.1) breaths per minute lower than the reference measurement by the spirometer embedded in the indirect calorimeter during the 15-minute rest, resulting in a MAPE of 8.3% (SD 7.0%). Activity type recognition of walking, running, cycling, or other was overall 90% accurate in reference to the activities performed.
   Conclusions: The health watch can serve its medical purpose of measuring resting heart rate and total energy expenditure over time in an unobtrusive manner, thereby providing valuable data for the prevention and management of lifestyle-related chronic diseases.

TI  - Application of Intelligent Sensor Network in the Assessment of Table Tennis Teaching and Training Intensity, Training Volume, and Physical Fitness
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
LA  - English
AB  - Sensor technology has been deeply into the sports industry, with the help of sensors to monitoring and collection data for the physical training in real-time. In table tennis, wearable sensors can record the amount of training, movement essentials, and the number of strokes of both hands and assist in the testing and evaluation of table tennis. This paper analyzes the application of wearable sensors in table tennis training activities and the details of signal collection and feature extraction. At the same time, machine learning technology often used to recognize and test table tennis training data, and a support vector machine (SVM) is one of the representative classifiers. Applying the processed signal data to the classification and testing of SVM can effectively identify the movement and evaluate the training effect and athletes' physical fitness. The integration of intelligent sensors and table tennis can effectively improve the evaluation efficiency and quality in the process of teaching and training.

AB  - Background: Rehabilitation services use outcome measures to track motor performance of their patients over time. State-of-the-art approaches use mainly patients' feedback and experts' observations for this purpose. We aim at continuously monitoring children in daily life and assessing normal activities to close the gap between movements done as instructed by caregivers and natural movements during daily life. To investigate the applicability of body-worn sensors for motor assessment in children, we investigated changes in movement capacity during defined motor tasks longitudinally.
   Methods: We performed a longitudinal study over four weeks with 4 children (2 girls; 2 diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy and 2 with stroke, on average 10.5 years old) undergoing rehabilitation. Every week, the children performed 10 predefined motor tasks. Capacity in terms of quality and quantity was assessed by experts and movement was monitored using 10 ETH Orientation Sensors (ETHOS), a small and unobtrusive inertial measurement unit. Features such as smoothness of movement were calculated from the sensor data and a regression was used to estimate the capacity from the features and their relation to clinical data. Therefore, the target and features were normalized to range from 0 to 1.
   Results: We achieved a mean RMS-error of 0.15 and a mean correlation value of 0.86 (p < 0.05 for all tasks) between our regression estimate of motor task capacity and experts' ratings across all tasks. We identified the most important features and were able to reduce the sensor setup from 10 to 3 sensors. We investigated features that provided a good estimate of the motor capacity independently of the task performed, e. g. smoothness of the movement.
   Conclusions: We found that children's task capacity can be assessed from wearable sensors and that some of the calculated features provide a good estimate of movement capacity over different tasks. This indicates the potential of using the sensors in daily life, when little or no information on the task performed is available. For the assessment, the use of three sensors on both wrists and the hip suffices. With the developed algorithms, we plan to assess children's motor performance in daily life with a follow-up study.

AB  - In this study, we propose the Ankle-Worn Sensor Sleeve to help people maintain their health. Furthermore, our approach uses this sensor sleeve to improve walking motivation by making the walking motion more sensible. In this research, we pursue the design of a wearable device that users can wear as a "shoe accessory," with the aim of promoting people's walking motivation. This device is ankle-worn and generates electricity using the physical flexion and extension of the ankle, detects and acquires the amount of electricity generated, and uses the resulting power to produce sound and light feedback while walking. The Sleeve is designed to support health problems, such as locomotive syndrome and dementia, which are caused by physical inactivity. This article presents the results of a questionnaire survey conducted on 172 people who experienced or observed the device during exhibitions. The results reveal that this device increased people's interest and motivation to walk, including those who did not like to walk.

AB  - Smoking is associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease and premature death and can cause severe fire hazards. To assist with smoking cessation, this paper presents a wireless body area network-based system consisting of two off-the-shelf devices, one smartphone and one smartwatch, to detect smoking events by mining the inertial sensor data from both devices. In the system, an end-to-end trainable unified model is implemented by combining a variational autoencoder with a random forest to classify the collected data into smoking and nonsmoking after data preprocessing. The variational autoencoder is adopted to learn the feature representation and deal with the class imbalance problem, and the stochastic decision forest is adopted to guide the global optimization of the parameter learning process. Extensive validation of our scheme is performed on a large dataset we collected, and our scheme yields quite promising results in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

AB  - Susceptibility to atrial fibrillation (AF) is determined by well-recognized risk factors such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension, emerging risk factors such as sleep apnea or inflammation, and increasingly well-defined genetic variants. As discussed in detail in a companion article in this series, studies in families and in large populations have identified multiple genetic loci, specific genes, and specific variants increasing susceptibility to AF. Since it is becoming increasingly inexpensive to obtain genotype data and indeed whole genome sequence data, the question then becomes to define whether using emerging new genetics knowledge can improve care for patients both before and after development of AF. Examples of improvements in care could include identifying patients at increased risk for AF (and thus deploying increased surveillance or even low-risk preventive therapies should these be available), identifying patient subsets in whom specific therapies are likely to be effective or ineffective or in whom the driving biology could motivate the development of new mechanism-based therapies or identifying an underlying susceptibility to comorbid cardiovascular disease. While current guidelines for the care of patients with AF do not recommend routine genetic testing, this rapidly increasing knowledge base suggests that testing may now or soon have a place in the management of select patients. The opportunity is to generate, validate, and deploy clinical predictors (including family history) of AF risk, to assess the utility of incorporating genomic variants into those predictors, and to identify and validate interventions such as wearable or implantable device-based monitoring ultimately to intervene in patients with AF before they present with catastrophic complications like heart failure or stroke.

AB  - Objective: Advances in sensor miniaturization and computational power have served as enabling technologies for monitoring human physiological conditions in real-world scenarios. Sleep disruption may impact neural function, and can be a symptom of both physical and mental disorders. This study proposes wearable in-ear electroencephalography (ear-EEG) for overnight sleep monitoring as a 24/7 continuous and unobtrusive technology for sleep quality assessment in the community. Methods: A total of 22 healthy participants took part in overnight sleep monitoring with simultaneous ear-EEG and conventional full polysomnography recordings. The ear-EEG data were analyzed in the both structural complexity and spectral domains. The extracted features were used for automatic sleep stage prediction through supervized machine learning, whereby the PSG data were manually scored by a sleep clinician. Results: The agreement between automatic sleep stage prediction based on ear-EEG from a single in-ear sensor and the hypnogram based on the full PSG was 74.1% in the accuracy over five sleep stage classification. This is supported by a substantial agreement in the kappa metric (0.61). Conclusion: The in-ear sensor is feasible for monitoring overnight sleep outside the sleep laboratory and also mitigates technical difficulties associated with PSG. It, therefore, represents a 24/7 continuously wearable alternative to conventional cumbersome and expensive sleep monitoring. Significance: The "standardized" one-size-fits-all viscoelastic in-ear sensor is a next generation solution to monitor sleep-this technology promises to be a viable method for readily wearable sleep monitoring in the community, a key to affordable healthcare and future eHealth.

AB  - Long-term monitoring of ECG via wearable monitoring systems has already been widely adopted to detect and prevent heart diseases. However, one of the main issues faced by wearable ECG monitoring systems is that motion artifacts significantly affect the systems' stability and reliability. Therefore, motion artifact reduction is a very challenging task in filtering and processing physiological signals. Based on the existing algorithms and ECG prior knowledge, in this paper, we propose an algorithm, CEEMDAN-IMFx-PCA-CICA, for motion artifact reduction in ambulatory ECG signals using single-channel blind source separation technique. Our algorithm first utilizes CEEMDAN to decompose the mixed signals into IMFs (intrinsic mode function) containing different source signal features, thereby forming new multi-dimensional signals. Using the correlation between IMFx (IMF component with the most ECG features) and each IMF, and PCA are then applied to reduce the dimension of each IMF. Finally, the blind separation of the source ECG signals is achieved by using CICA with IMFx as the constraint reference component. The results of our experiments indicate that our algorithm outperformed CEEMDAN-CICA, CEEMDAN-PCA-CICA, and improved CEEMDAN-PCA-CICA. Besides, the number of iterations of the CICA is significantly reduced; the separated source signal is better; the obtained result is stable. Furthermore, the separated ECG signal has a higher correlation with the source ECG signal and a lower RRMSE, especially in the case of high noise-to-signal ratios.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) based on the perspective of data elements is widely used in the healthcare informatics domain. Large amounts of clinical data from electronic medical records (EMRs), electronic health records (EHRs), and electroencephalography records (EEGs) have been generated and collected at an unprecedented speed and scale. For instance, the new generation of wearable technologies enables easy-collecting peoples' daily health data such as blood pressure, blood glucose, and physiological data, as well as the application of EHRs documenting large amounts of patient data. The cost of acquiring and processing health big data is expected to reduce dramatically with the help of AI technologies and open-source big data platforms such as Hadoop and Spark. The application of AI technologies in health big data presents new opportunities to discover the relationship among living habits, sports, inheritances, diseases, symptoms, and drugs. Meanwhile, with the development of fast-growing AI technologies, many promising methodologies are proposed in the healthcare field recently. In this paper, we review and discuss the application of machine learning (ML) methods in health big data in two major aspects: (1) Special features of health big data including multimodal, incompletion, time validation, redundancy, and privacy. (2) ML methodologies in the healthcare field including classification, regression, clustering, and association.

AB  - Construction workers are prone to physical and mental stress because of the characteristics of the construction industry. Researchers and practitioners agree that physical and mental stress should be proactively managed to mitigate their ill-effects which range from making errors to causing accidents and short term to long term illnesses. Accordingly, numerous research endeavors have pursued automated solutions for their monitoring to replace manual and subjective physical and mental stress monitoring. While these studies have been successful, they attempted to monitor either physical stress or mental stress at a time. Studies have shown that many times, construction workers are simultaneously exposed to both, physical and mental stress, necessitating automated simultaneous monitoring of physical and mental stress for more comprehensive workload evaluation. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to assess the possibility of accurately monitoring physical and mental stress simultaneously using physiological measures and machine learning algorithms. For the purpose, experiments were conducted that comprised of physical and mental stress scenarios. The results showed that using 56 features derived from heart rate, skin temperature, breathing rate and skin conductance, an accuracy of 94.7% was achieved for simultaneous physical and mental stress monitoring. Additionally, the study further investigated the impact of varying the features and physiological measures and discussed the potential future work in this direction. Overall, this study for the first time, demonstrated that it is possible to simultaneously monitor physical and mental stress with high accuracy. Moreover, it has laid the foundation for future studies to enable simultaneous physical and mental stress monitoring on actual job sites.

AB  - In this paper, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) regarding recent technology is discussed in a healthcare perspective. Various healthcare devices have emerged in recent years, allowing individuals to diagnose and manage their health conditions easily at home. However, the diagnostic utilization of IoT healthcare services is not yet fully integrated with the Internet. For this reason, people still have to go, for example, through a hands-on sampling process to self-analyze their urine, which is the same for inspectors in hospital labs. Therefore, with the exception of people suffering from certain diseases (e.g., diabetes), there are only a few who check their own health status due to the inconvenience. In this paper, sensor-based urine and feces separating toilet proposes a categorizing method for the user's toilet, which applies various scenarios and analyses of the urine components using long-range wireless communication technology to transmit data from the smart toilet to the user.

AB  - Background: Dual-task actions challenge cognitive processing. The usefulness of objective methods based on dual-task actions to identify the cognitive status of older adults has been previously demonstrated. However, the properties of select motor and cognitive tasks are still debatable. We investigated the effect of cognitive task difficulty and motor task type (walking versus an upper-extremity function [UEF]) in identifying cognitive impairment in older adults.
   Methods: Older adults (>= 65 years) were recruited, and cognitive ability was measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Participants performed repetitive elbow flexion under three conditions: 1) at maximum pace alone (Single-task); and 2) while counting backward by ones (Dual-task 1); and 3) threes (Dual-task 2). Similar single- and dual-task gait were performed at normal speed. Three-dimensional kinematics were measured for both motor functions using wearable sensors.
   Results: One-hundred older adults participated in this study. Based on MoCA score,20, 21 (21%) of the participants were considered cognitively impaired (mean age = 86 +/- 10 and 85 +/- 5 for cognitively impaired and intact participants, respectively). Within ANOVA models adjusted with demographic information, UEF dual-task parameters, including speed and range-of-motion variability were significantly higher by 52% on average, among cognitively impaired participant (p<0.01). Logistic models with these UEF parameters plus age predicted cognitive status with sensitivity, specificity, and area under curve (AUC) of 71%, 81% and 0.77 for Dual-task 1. The corresponding values for UEF Dual-task 2 were 91%, 73% and 0.81, respectively. ANOVA results were non-significant for gait parameters within both dual-task conditions (p>0.26).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that counting backward by threes within a UEF dual-task experiment was a pertinent and challenging enough task to detect cognitive impairment in older adults. Additionally, UEF was superior to gait as the motor task component of the dual-task. The UEF dual-task could be applied as a quick memory screen in a clinical setting.

AB  - Simultaneous detection of multiple miRNAs of one disease can greatly reduce misdiagnosis and improve the detection rate, which is helpful for early cancer diagnosis. Here, a programmable microparticle-array-based acoustic microchip for in situ simultaneous multiple miRNAs detection is developed. On this microchip, the multiple probes-labeled microparticle array can be procedurally arranged in a microfluidic reaction chamber when four orthogonally piezoelectric transducers are applied. The probes-labeled microparticle array offers a platform for full molecular contact under dynamic ultrasonic streaming, and the array supplies a multipoint data correction to reduce the false positive of the detection results for more precisely visible fluorescence multiple target miRNAs sensing. We employed miRNA-21, miRNA-210, and miRNA-155 as specific biomarkers of pancreatic cancer and successfully finished the multiple miRNAs simultaneous detection in the microchip with a detection limit of 139.1, 179.9, and 111.4 pM, respectively. Such a device is programmable by adjusting the imputing frequency and voltage, and target biomarkers can be easily collected when the ultrasound force is released for further analysis, which shows great potential in multiple miRNAs enrichment and simultaneous detection for cancer clinical diagnosis.

AB  - The provision of continuous passive, and intent-based assisted movements for neuromuscular training can be incorporated into a robotic elbow sleeve. The objective of this study is to propose the design and test the functionality of a soft robotic elbow sleeve in assisting flexion and extension of the elbow, both passively and using intent-based motion reinforcement. First, the elbow sleeve was developed, using elastomeric and fabric-based pneumatic actuators, which are soft and lightweight, in order to address issues of non-portability and poor alignment with joints that conventional robotic rehabilitation devices are faced with. Second, the control system was developed to allow for: (i) continuous passive actuation, in which the actuators will be activated in cycles, alternating between flexion and extension: and (ii) an intent-based actuation, in which user intent is detected by surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors attached to the biceps and triceps, and passed through a logic sequence to allow for flexion or extension of the elbow. Using this setup, the elbow sleeve was tested on six healthy subjects to assess the functionality of the device, in terms of the range of motion afforded by the device while in the continuous passive actuation. The results showed that the elbow sleeve is capable of achieving approximately 50% of the full range of motion of the elbow joint among all subjects. Next, further experiments were conducted to test the efficacy of the intent-based actuation on these healthy subjects. The results showed that all subjects were capable of achieving electromyography (EMG) control of the elbow sleeve. These preliminary results show that the elbow sleeve is capable of carrying out continuous passive and intent-based assisted movements. Further investigation of the clinical implementation of the elbow sleeve for the neuromuscular training of neurologically-impaired persons, such as stroke survivors, is needed.

AB  - Advancements in information technology have benefited the healthcare industry by providing it with distinct methods of managing medical data which improve the quality of medical services. The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence are the foundations for innovative sustainable computing technologies in e-healthcare applications. In the IoT-enabled sustainable healthcare system, the IoT devices normally record the patient data and transfer it to the cloud for further processing. Security is considered an important issue in the design of IoT networks in the healthcare environment. To resolve this issue, this article presents a novel blockchain and artificial intelligence-enabled secure medical data transmission (BAISMDT) for IoT networks. The goal of the BAISMDT model is to achieve security and privacy in reliable data transmission of the IoT networks. The proposed model involves a signcryption technique for secure and reliable IoT data transmission. The blockchain-enabled secure medical data transmission process takes place among the IoT gadgets and service providers. The blockchain technique is applied to generate a viable environment to securely and reliably transmit data among different data providers. Next to the decryption process, the modified discrete particle swarm optimization algorithm with wavelet kernel extreme learning machine model is applied to determine the presence of disease. An extensive set of simulations were carried out on a benchmark medical dataset. The experimental results analysis pointed out the superior performance of the proposed BAISMDT model with the accuracy of 97.54% and 98.13% on the applied Heart Statlog and WBC dataset, respectively.

AB  - The advent of home blood glucose monitoring revolutionized diabetes management, and the recent introduction of both wearable devices and closed-loop continuous systems has enormously impacted the lives of people with diabetes. We describe the first fully injectable soft electrochemical glucose sensor for in situ monitoring. Collagen, the main component of a native extracellular matrix in humans and animals, was used to fabricate an in situ gellable self-supporting electroconductive hydrogel that can be injected onto an electrode surface or into porcine meat to detect glucose amperometrically. The study provides a proof-of-principle of an injectable electrochemical sensor suitable for monitoring tissue glucose levels that may, with further development, prove clinically useful in the future.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are considered as the leading cause of death and almost 80% of deaths from this disease are developed in poor and less developed countries where early detection facilities are less available, along with overlooking the importance of screening. In other words, real-time monitoring of the physiological signals using flexible and wearable biosensors plays an important role in human life style. Thus, the present study aims to propose two dimensional flexible and wearable gold covered plasmonic samples as a physiological signal recorder, in which chips with nano array of resonant nanowire patterns performing in an integrated platform of plasmonic devices. The produced surface plasmon waves in our main chip were paired with an electric wave from the heart pulse and it use for recording and detecting the heartbeat of a toad with high accuracy. This measurement was performed in normal state and under external laser heating process to check the ability of signal recording and also thermoplasmonic effect onto the toad's heart signal. Our results show that our sensor was enough sensitive for detection while raising the body temperature of the toad and changing its heart rate as flatting T and P waves by thermoplasmonic effect.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects on common poststroke gait compensations of a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to assist the paretic limb during hemiparetic walking.
   Design: A single-session study of eight individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery was conducted. Two testing conditions were compared: walking with the exosuit powered versus walking with the exosuit unpowered. Each condition was 8 minutes in duration.
   Results: Compared with walking with the exosuit unpowered, walking with the exosuit powered resulted in reductions in hip hiking (27[6%], P = 0.004) and circumduction (20[5%], P = 0.004). A relationship between changes in knee flexion and changes in hip hiking was observed (Pearson r = - 0.913, P< 0.001). Similarly, multivariate regression revealed that changes in knee flexion (beta = -0.912, P= 0.007), but not ankle dorsiflexion (beta = -0.194, P = 0.341), independently predicted changes in hip hiking (R-2 = 0.87, F(2, 4) = 13.48, P = 0.017).
   Conclusions: Exosuit assistance of the paretic limb during walking produces immediate changes in the kinematic strategy used to advance the paretic limb. Future work is necessary to determine how exosuit-induced reductions in paretic hip hiking and circumduction during gait training could be leveraged to facilitate more normal walking behavior during unassisted walking.

AB  - There is a crucial need to process patient's data immediately to make a sound decision rapidly; this data has a very large size and excessive features. Recently, many cloud-based IoT healthcare systems are proposed in the literature. However, there are still several challenges associated with the processing time and overall system efficiency concerning big healthcare data. This paper introduces a novel approach for processing healthcare data and predicts useful information with the support of the use of minimum computational cost. The main objective is to accept several types of data and improve accuracy and reduce the processing time. The proposed approach uses a hybrid algorithm which will consist of two phases. The first phase aims to minimize the number of features for big data by using the Whale Optimization Algorithm as a feature selection technique. After that, the second phase performs real-time data classification by using Naive Bayes Classifier. The proposed approach is based on fog Computing for better business agility, better security, deeper insights with privacy, and reduced operation cost. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can reduce the number of datasets features, improve the accuracy and reduce the processing time. Accuracy enhanced by average rate: 3.6% (3.34 for Diabetes, 2.94 for Heart disease, 3.77 for Heart attack prediction, and 4.15 for Sonar). Besides, it enhances the processing speed by reducing the processing time by an average rate: 8.7% (28.96 for Diabetes, 1.07 for Heart disease, 3.31 for Heart attack prediction, and 1.4 for Sonar).

AB  - The radial pulse is considered as a fundamental indicator for the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, which can guide therapeutic decisions in complex clinical situations. We designed and fabricated a real-time low-cost wearable pulse monitoring system based on a graphene-coated fiber to detect the radial pulse. The graphene-coated fiber, acting as sensing component, had excellent conductance property and high sensitivity. However, the amplitude of the pulse is subtle, always masked by noise. As a consequence, a diminutive signal conditioning unit integrated with a low-noise instrument amplifier was developed to enhance the signals. Furtherly, we proposed a newly multistage filter method to attenuate the noise synchronously. The signal noise ratio was improved by at least 27 dB, compared with a traditional measurement method. Meanwhile, a graphical user interface was developed to monitor the pulses in real time, making the monitor convenient and timely. The heart rate, which is of clinical significance, was measured accurately. The data were being stored in the PC terminal simultaneously to obtain an overall heart health and fitness level. The superior sensing performance and economic fabrication process of the pulse monitoring system strengthen our confidence in the application of the smart fabrics in wearable sensing and home health care fields.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) systems are becoming ubiquitous and assuring their quality is fundamental. Unfortunately, a few proposals for testing these complex, and often safety-critical, systems are present in the literature. The authors propose an approach for acceptance testing of IoT systems adopting graphical user interfaces as a principal way of interaction. Acceptance testing is a type of black box testing based on test scenarios, i.e. sequences of steps/actions performed by the user or the system. In their approach, test scenarios are derived from a state machine that expresses the behaviour of the system under test, and test cases are derived from them by specifying the actual data and assertions and made executable by implementing the corresponding test scripts. As a case study, they selected a mobile health IoT system for diabetes management composed of local sensors/actuators, smartphones, and a remote cloud-based system. The effectiveness of the approach has been evaluated by measuring the capability of two test suites implemented using different localisation strategies (visual and structure-based) in detecting mutants of the original m-health system. Results show the effectiveness of the test suites implemented by following the proposed approach since 93% of the generated mutants have been detected.

AB  - Once diagnosed with cancer, a patient goes through a series of diagnosis and tests, which are referred to as "after cancer treatment". Due to the nature of the treatment and side effects, maintaining quality of life (QoL) in the home environment is a challenging task. Sometimes, a cancer patient's situation changes abruptly as the functionality of certain organs deteriorates, which affects their QoL. One way of knowing the physiological functional status of a cancer patient is to design an occupational therapy. In this paper, we propose a blockchain and off-chain-based framework, which will allow multiple medical and ambient intelligent Internet of Things sensors to capture the QoL information from one's home environment and securely share it with their community of interest. Using our proposed framework, both transactional records and multimedia big data can be shared with an oncologist or palliative care unit for real-time decision support. We have also developed blockchain-based data analytics, which will allow a clinician to visualize the immutable history of the patient's data available from an in-home secure monitoring system for a better understanding of a patient's current or historical states. Finally, we will present our current implementation status, which provides significant encouragement for further development.

AB  - Background: Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a progressive, enduring, and sometimes irreversible neurotoxic symptom that occurs in 30-40% of chemotherapy-treated cancer patients. CIPN negatively affects both the patient's abilities to perform daily activities and their health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after chemotherapy treatment. Although this neuropathy has been treated with duloxetine and/or gabapentin, limited therapeutic benefits have been reported, thereby necessitating the development of an integrated approach that combines pharmacological management and complementary methods such as acupuncture and electric nerve stimulation. Therefore, this study is designed to examine the effect of a portable, low-frequency electrostimulation (ES) device on CIPN symptoms and HRQOL of female patients diagnosed with CIPN immediately after chemotherapy for breast cancer.
   Methods: This study is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with two parallel groups and a 2-week follow-up. We will enroll 80 breast cancer patients who are newly diagnosed with CIPN after chemotherapy. Duloxetine or pregabalin will be prescribed to all participants from the initial assessment. Half of the patients will be assigned into the experimental group and the other half to the control group. The CarebandR (Piomed Inc., Seoul, Korea), a wearable wristband that generates low-frequency electrostimulation, will be administered only to the experimental group. Electrostimulation will be administered on the unilateral PC6 acupoint. A numerical rating scale will be used to assess the overall intensity of CIPN symptoms. The key secondary outcome variables include patient-reported CIPN symptom distress tested by a self-rated questionnaire, physician-rated symptom severity assessed by the Total Neuropathy Score, and HRQOL.
   Discussion: It is expected that the combination of a low-frequency electrostimulation device and pharmacological intervention (duloxetine or pregabalin) will produce synergistic effects in breast cancer patients with CIPN after treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the beneficial effect of a new integrated approach for CIPN management after breast cancer treatment. The study findings can expand our knowledge and understanding of the occurrence of CIPN and the efficacy of integrated intervention efforts to ameliorate CIPN symptoms.

AB  - The development of a novel flexible and ultrasensitive aptasensor based on carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/ reduced graphene oxide-based field effect transistor (FET) has been reported for label-free detection of the ovarian cancer antigen (CA125). The fabricated sensor has a straightforward design based on the noncovalent attachment of MWCNTs/aptamer conjugated onto few layers reduced graphene oxide nanosheets and its integration with poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a suitable platform for designing flexible field-effect transistors. The surface properties of the aptasensor were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Under optimal conditions, the proposed aptasensor exhibited a wide linear dynamic range for CA125 (1.0 x 10 x(-9)-1.0 U/mL) with a low detection limit of 5.0 x 10 x(-10) U/mL. The proposed aptasensor was also successfully applied to detect CA125 in real human serum samples. Furthermore, sensor flexibility is also a challenging area in chemical and biological sensors, especially for portable, wearable, or even implantable sensors, so, the reduced graphene oxide-based FET-type aptasensor showed bendable flexibility on the PMMA substrate. In addition, the aptasensor exhibited high sensitivity, selectivity, stability and reproducibility which offers great promise as a high performance and flexible FET-type aptasensor to detect CA125 and other cancer biomarkers in clinical samples and biological fluids.

AB  - Air pollution is now becoming a global issue because it directly affects human health, by creating cancer, respiratory and cardiac diseases, and the earth's ecosystem, by causing climate change and depletion of ozone layers. The rapid expansion of civilization and industrialization, leading to hazardous emissions from automobiles, chemical industries, and fossil fuel burning, plays a significant role in air and atmospheric pollution. Unmanned aerial systems and the internet of things-based sensing devices have provided new impetus for automatic air pollution monitoring and analysis. In this paper, an automatic indoor and outdoor air quality monitoring system has been developed using an unmanned aerial vehicle: a drone. The proposed device is constructed from an ultra-strength DJI F450 frame, various gas sensors, a particulate matter detector, and a camera to detect and distinguish air pollution data. The precision and sensitivity of the proposed device have been evaluated by collecting air emissions data from two places in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The drone has been navigated in Uttara and Bashundhara areas to measure the amount of CO, CO2, O3, SO2, NOx, and dust in indoor and outdoor environments. We obtained higher air pollution concentrations in Uttara than in Bashundhara, as it is an area with more industries and construction sites. The proposed system composed of an uncrewed aerial device and low-cost gas monitoring sensors is expected to create new possibilities in environmental and air pollution monitoring.

AB  - Although levodopa remains the most efficacious symptomatic therapy for Parkinson disease (PD), management of levodopa treatment during the advanced stages of the disease is extremely challenging. This difficulty is a result of levodopa's short half-life, a progressive narrowing of the therapeutic window, and major inter-patient and intra-patient variations in the dose-response relationship. Therefore, a suitable alternative to repeated oral administration of levodopa is being sought. Recent research efforts have focused on the development of novel levodopa delivery strategies and wearable physical sensors that track symptoms and disease progression. However, the need for methods to monitor the levels of levodopa present in the body in real time has been overlooked. Advances in chemical sensor technology mean that the development of wearable and mobile biosensors for continuous or frequent levodopa measurements is now possible. Such levodopa monitoring could help to deliver personalized and timely medication dosing to alleviate treatment-related fluctuations in the symptoms of PD. Therefore, with the aim of optimizing therapeutic management of PD and improving the quality of life of patients, we share our vision of a future closed-loop autonomous wearable 'sense-and-act' system. This system consists of a network of physical and chemical sensors coupled with a levodopa delivery device and is guided by effective big data fusion algorithms and machine learning methods.
   In this Perspective, the authors present their vision for a closed-loop system for automatic symptom monitoring and levodopa administration in individuals with Parkinson disease. The system would capitalize on the ongoing advances in wearable sensor technology, drug delivery systems and machine learning.

AB  - Background: Excess weight is a major risk factor for chronic diseases. In Australia, over 60% of adults are overweight or obese. The overconsumption of energy-dense nutrient-poor (EDNP) foods and low physical activity (PA) levels are key factors contributing to population obesity. New cost-effective approaches to improve population diet and PA behaviors are needed.
   Objective: This 1-year randomized controlled trial (6-month intervention and 6-month follow-up) aims to investigate whether a tailored intervention using mobile technology can improve diet and PA behaviors leading to weight loss in adults (aged 18-65 years) who are overweight or obese and recruited through a social marketing campaign (LiveLighter).
   Methods: All eligible participants will provide data on demographics and lifestyle behaviors online at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Using two-stage randomization, participants will be allocated into one of three conditions (n=200 per group): tailored feedback delivered via email at seven time points, informed by objective dietary (mobile food record app) and activity (wearable activity monitor) assessment; active control receiving no tailored feedback, but undergoing the same objective assessments as tailored feedback; and online control receiving no tailored feedback or objective assessments. Primary outcome measures at 6 and 12 months are changes in body mass, EDNP food and beverage consumption, and daily moderate-to-vigorous PA (measured via accelerometry). Secondary outcomes include change in fruit and vegetable consumption, daily sedentary behaviors, and cost effectiveness.
   Results: Enrolment commenced in August 2017. Primary outcomes at 12 months will be available for analysis from September 2019.
   Conclusions: Tailored email feedback provided to individuals may deliver a cost-effective strategy to overcome existing barriers to improving diet and PA. If found to be successful and cost effective, upscaling this intervention for inclusion in larger-scale interventions is highly feasible.

AB  - The center of plantar pressure (COP) reflects the dynamic balance of subjects to a certain extent. In this study, wearable pressure insoles are designed, body pose measure is detected by the Kinect sensor, and a balance evaluation system is formulated. With the designed games for the interactive actions, the Kinect sensor reads the skeletal poses to judge whether the desired action is performed, and the pressure insoles simultaneously collect the plantar pressure data. The COP displacement and its speed are calculated to determine the body sway and the ability of balance control. Significant differences in the dispersion of the COP distribution of the 12 subjects have been obtained, indicating different balancing abilities of the examined subjects. A novel assessment process is also proposed in the paper, in which a correlation analysis is made between the de facto sit-to-stand (STS) test and the proposed method; the Pearson and Spearman correlations are also conducted, which reveal a significant positive correlation. Finally, four undergraduate volunteers with a right leg sports injury participate in the experiments. The experimental results show that the normal side and abnormal side have significantly different characters, suggesting that our method is effective and robust for balance measurements.

AB  - Recently, mobile healthcare services have attracted significant attention because of the emerging development and supply of diverse wearable devices. Smartwatches and health bands are the most common type of mobile-based wearable devices and their market size is increasing considerably. However, simple value comparisons based on accumulated data have revealed certain problems, such as the standardized nature of health management and the lack of personalized health management service models. The convergence of information technology (IT) and biotechnology (BT) has shifted the medical paradigm from continuous health management and disease prevention to the development of a system that can be used to provide ground-based medical services regardless of the user's location. Moreover, the IT-BT convergence has necessitated the development of lifestyle improvement models and services that utilize big data analysis and machine learning to provide mobile healthcare-based personal health management and disease prevention information. Users' health data, which are specific as they change over time, are collected by different means according to the users' lifestyle and surrounding circumstances. In this paper, we propose a prediction model of user physical activity that uses data characteristics-based long short-term memory (DC-LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs). To provide personalized services, the characteristics and surrounding circumstances of data collectable from mobile host devices were considered in the selection of variables for the model. The data characteristics considered were ease of collection, which represents whether or not variables are collectable, and frequency of occurrence, which represents whether or not changes made to input values constitute significant variables in terms of activity. The variables selected for providing personalized services were activity, weather, temperature, mean daily temperature, humidity, UV, fine dust, asthma and lung disease probability index, skin disease probability index, cadence, travel distance, mean heart rate, and sleep hours. The selected variables were classified according to the data characteristics. To predict activity, an LSTM RNN was built that uses the classified variables as input data and learns the dynamic characteristics of time series data. LSTM RNNs resolve the vanishing gradient problem that occurs in existing RNNs. They are classified into three different types according to data characteristics and constructed through connections among the LSTMs. The constructed neural network learns training data and predicts user activity. To evaluate the proposed model, the root mean square error (RMSE) was used in the performance evaluation of the user physical activity prediction method for which an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a convolutional neural network (CNN), and an RNN were used. The results show that the proposed DC-LSTM RNN method yields an excellent mean RMSE value of 0.616. The proposed method is used for predicting significant activity considering the surrounding circumstances and user status utilizing the existing standardized activity prediction services. It can also be used to predict user physical activity and provide personalized healthcare based on the data collectable from mobile host devices.

AB  - Motor neurons convey information about motor intent that can be extracted and interpreted to control assistive devices. However, most methods for measuring the firing activity of single neurons rely on implanted microelectrodes. Although intracortical brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been shown to be safe and effective, the requirement for surgery poses a barrier to widespread use that can be mitigated by instead using noninvasive interfaces. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of deriving motor control signals from a wearable sensor that can detect residual motor unit activity in paralyzed muscles after chronic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Despite generating no observable hand movement, volitional recruitment of motor units below the level of injury was observed across attempted movements of individual fingers and overt wrist and elbow movements. Subgroups of motor units were coactive during flexion or extension phases of the task. Single digit movement intentions were classified offline from the electromyogram (EMG) power [root-mean-square (RMS)] or motor unit firing rates with median classification accuracies >75% in both cases. Simulated online control of a virtual hand was performed with a binary classifier to test feasibility of real-time extraction and decoding of motor units. The online decomposition algorithm extracted motor units in 1.2 ms, and the firing rates predicted the correct digit motion 88 +/- 24% of the time. This study provides the first demonstration of a wearable interface for recording and decoding firing rates of motor units below the level of injury in a person with motor complete SCI.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY A wearable electrode array and machine learning methods were used to record and decode myoelectric signals and motor unit firing in paralyzed muscles of a person with motor complete tetraplegia. The myoelectric activity and motor unit firing rates were task specific, even in the absence of visible motion, enabling accurate classification of attempted single-digit movements. This wearable system has the potential to enable people with tetraplegia to control assistive devices through movement intent.

AB  - Mental stress is on the rise as one of the major health problems in modern society. It is important to detect and manage mental stress to prevent various diseases caused by stress and to maintain a healthy life. The purpose of this paper is to present new heart rate variability (HRV) features based on empirical mode decomposition and to detect acute mental stress through short-term HRV (5 min) and ultra-short-term HRV (under 5 min) analysis. HRV signals were acquired from 74 young police officers using acute stressors, including the Trier Social Stress Test and horror movie viewing, and a total of 26 features, including the proposed IMF energy features and general HRV features, were extracted. A support vector machine (SVM) classification model is used to classify the stress and non-stress states through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The classification accuracies of short-term HRV and ultra-short-term HRV analysis are 86.5% and 90.5%, respectively. In the results of ultra-short-term HRV analysis using various time lengths, we suggest the optimal duration to detect mental stress, which can be applied to wearable devices or healthcare systems.

AB  - Purpose Walking for health is recommended by health agencies, partly based on epidemiological studies of self-reported behaviors. Accelerometers are now replacing survey data, but it is not clear that intensity-based cut points reflect the behaviors previously reported. New computational techniques can help classify raw accelerometer data into behaviors meaningful for public health.
   Methods Five hundred twenty days of triaxial 30-Hz accelerometer data from three studies (n = 78) were employed as training data. Study 1 included prescribed activities completed in natural settings. The other two studies included multiple days of free-living data with SenseCam-annotated ground truth. The two populations in the free-living data sets were demographically and physical different. Random forest classifiers were trained on each data set, and the classification accuracy on the training data set and that applied to the other available data sets were assessed. Accelerometer cut points were also compared with the ground truth from the three data sets.
   Results The random forest classified all behaviors with over 80% accuracy. Classifiers developed on the prescribed data performed with higher accuracy than the free-living data classifier, but these did not perform as well on the free-living data sets. Many of the observed behaviors occurred at different intensities compared with those identified by existing cut points.
   Conclusions New machine learning classifiers developed from prescribed activities (study 1) were considerably less accurate when applied to free-living populations or to a functionally different population (studies 2 and 3). These classifiers, developed on free-living data, may have value when applied to large cohort studies with existing hip accelerometer data.

AB  - Detecting and treating breast cancer at earlier stages is highly proved to improve the survival rate of breast cancer patients as breast cancer is considered a major cause of death worldwide. Classical methods for diagnosing breast cancer depend on human expertise and they incur huge amounts of labor, time and are subject to human error. An Integrated Artificial Immune system and Artificial Bee Colony based breast cancer diagnosis (IAIS-ABC-CDS) is proposed for parallel processing of effective feature selection and parameter optimization in an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The IAIS-ABC-CDS with Momentum-based Gradient Descent Backpropagation (MBGD) that uses the advantages of Simulated Annealing (SA) for enhancing local search process is compared to the benchmark diagnosis schemes of IAIS-ABC-CDS with Resilient BackPropagation Techniques (RBPT) and Genetic Algorithm based ANN with Multilayer Perceptron (GA-ANN-MLP) schemes. The proposed IAIS-ABC-CDS is confirmed to produce a mean classification of 99.34% and 99.11% in ANN under the Wisconsin dataset.

AB  - Background: Few studies assessing the correlation between patient-reported outcomes and patient-generated health data from wearable devices exist.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the direction and magnitude of associations between patient-generated health data (from the Fitbit Charge HR) and patient-reported outcomes for sleep patterns and physical activity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
   Methods: This was a pilot study conducted with adults diagnosed with T2DM (n=86). All participants wore a Fitbit Charge HR for 14 consecutive days and completed internet-based surveys at 3 time points: day 1, day 7, and day 14. Patient-generated health data included minutes asleep and number of steps taken. Questionnaires assessed the number of days of exercise and nights of sleep problems per week. Means and SDs were calculated for all data, and Pearson correlations were used to examine associations between patient-reported outcomes and patient-generated health data. All respondents provided informed consent before participating.
   Results: The participants were predominantly middle-aged (mean 54.3, SD 13.3 years), white (80/86, 93%), and female (50/86, 58%). Use of oral T2DM medication correlated with the number of mean steps taken (r=.35, P=.001), whereas being unaware of the glycated hemoglobin level correlated with the number of minutes asleep (r=-.24, P=.04). On the basis of the Fitbit data, participants walked an average of 4955 steps and slept 6.7 hours per day. They self-reported an average of 2.0 days of exercise and 2.3 nights of sleep problems per week. The association between the number of days exercised and steps walked was strong (r=.60, P<.001), whereas the association between the number of troubled sleep nights and minutes asleep was weaker (r=. 28, P=.02).
   Conclusions: Fitbit and patient-reported data were positively associated for physical activity as well as sleep, with the former more strongly correlated than the latter. As extensive patient monitoring can guide clinical decisions regarding T2DM therapy, passive, objective data collection through wearables could potentially enhance patient care, resulting in better patient-reported outcomes.

AB  - Background: Glucose control in artificial pancreas (AP) studies is commonly assessed by metrics such as the percentage of time with blood glucose (BG) concentration below 70 mg/dL or in the nearly normal range 70-180 mg/dL (in brief, time in hypoglycemia and time in target, respectively). In outpatient studies these control metrics can be computed only from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor data, with the risk of an unfair assessment because of their inaccuracy. The aim of the present article is to show that the control metrics can be much more accurately determined if CGM data are preprocessed by a recently proposed retrofitting algorithm.
   Subjects and Methods: Data from 47 type 1 diabetes subjects are considered. Subjects were studied in a closed-loop control trial prescribing three 24-h admissions. Glucose concentration was monitored using the Dexcom((R)) (San Diego, CA) SEVEN (R) Plus CGM sensor. Frequent BG reference values were collected in parallel with the YSI analyzer (Yellow Springs Instrument, Yellow Springs, OH). To simulate the few reference values available in outpatient conditions, we down-sampled the YSI data and provided to the retrofitting algorithm only the reference values that would have been collected in outpatient protocols. Time in hypoglycemia, time in target, mean, and SD of glucose profile were computed on the basis of both the original and the retrofitted CGM traces and compared with those computed using the frequently obtained YSI data.
   Results: Using the retrofitted traces, the average error affecting the estimation of time in hypoglycemia and time in target was approximately halved with respect to the original CGM traces (from 4.5% to 1.9% and from 8.7% to 4.4%, respectively). Error in mean and SD was reduced even further, from 10.0 mg/dL to 3.5 mg/dL and from 8.6 mg/dL to 2.9 mg/dL, respectively.
   Conclusions: The improved accuracy of retrofitted CGM with respect to the original CGM traces allows a more reliable assessment of glucose control in outpatient AP studies.

AB  - Background: Research on foot problems and frailty is sparse and could advance using wearable sensor-based measures of gait, balance, and physical activity (PA). This study examined the effect of foot problems on the likelihood of falls, frailty syndrome, motor performance, and PA in community-dwelling older adults.
   Methods: Arizona Frailty Cohort Study participants (community-dwelling adults aged >65 years without baseline cognitive deficit, severe movement disorders, or recent stroke) underwent Fried frailty and foot assessment. Gait, balance (bipedal eyes open and eyes closed), and spontaneous PA over 48 hours were measured using validated wearable sensor technologies.
   Results: Of 117 participants, 41 (35%) were nonfrail, 56 (48%) prefrail, and 20 (17%) frail. Prevalence of foot problems (pain, peripheral neuropathy, or deformity) increased significantly as frailty category worsened (any problem: 63% in nonfrail, 80% in prefrail [odds ratio (OR)= 2.0], and 95% in frail [OR =8.3]; P=.03 for trend) due to associations between foot problems and both weakness and exhaustion. Foot problems were associated with fear of falling but not with fall history or incident falls over 6 months. Foot pain and peripheral neuropathy were associated with lower gait speed and stride length; increased double support time; increased mediolateral sway of center of mass during walking, age adjusted; decreased eyes open sway of center of mass and ankle during quiet standing, age adjusted; and lower percentage walking, percentage standing, and total steps per day.
   Conclusions: Foot problems were associated with frailty level and decreased motor performance and PA. Wearable technology is a practical way to screen for deterioration in gait, balance, and PA that may be associated with foot problems. Routine assessment and management of foot problems could promote earlier intervention to retain motor performance and manage fear of falling in older adults, which may ultimately improve healthy aging and reduce risk of frailty.

AB  - Studies using wearable sensors to measure posture, physical activity (PA), and sedentary behavior typically use a single sensor worn on the ankle, thigh, wrist, or hip. Although the use of single sensors may be convenient, using multiple sensors is becoming more practical as sensors miniaturize. Purpose: We evaluated the effect of single-site versus multisite motion sensing at seven body locations (both ankles, wrists, hips, and dominant thigh) on the detection of physical behavior recognition using a machine learning algorithm. We also explored the effect of using orientation versus orientation-invariant features on performance. Methods: Performance (F1 score) of PA and posture recognition was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on a 42-participant data set containing 22 physical activities with three postures (lying, sitting, and upright). Results: Posture and PA recognition models using two sensors had higher F1 scores (posture, 0.89 +/- 0.06; PA, 0.53 +/- 0.08) than did models using a single sensor (posture, 0.78 +/- 0.11; PA, 0.43 +/- 0.03). Models using two nonwrist sensors for posture recognition (F1 score, 0.93 +/- 0.03) outperformed two-sensor models including one or two wrist sensors (F1 score, 0.85 +/- 0.06). However, two-sensor models for PA recognition with at least one wrist sensor (F1 score, 0.60 +/- 0.05) outperformed other two-sensor models (F1 score, 0.47 +/- 0.02). Both posture and PA recognition F1 scores improved with more sensors (up to seven; 0.99 for posture and 0.70 for PA), but with diminishing performance returns. Models performed best when including orientation-based features. Conclusions: Researchers measuring posture should consider multisite sensing using at least two nonwrist sensors, and researchers measuring PA should consider multisite sensing using at least one wrist sensor and one nonwrist sensor. Including orientation-based features improved both posture and PA recognition.

AB  - A healthy diet is a major concern for everyone, especially for those with specific diseases, such as diabetes. Meanwhile, with the rapid development of new technologies, it is feasible for us to detect the deep latent relationship between daily meals and wellbeing. Advanced Internet of Things devices, such as smart bracelets and wearable cameras, make it possible for people to know how food is related to health at any time. However, it is still arduous for individuals to memorize all the health information and utilize them to regulate their diet. To deal with such problems, we propose a novel system called cross-modal retrieval on diabetogenic food (CMRDF) which realizes a real-time dietary notice based on multimodal data captured from wearable devices. In this system, we propose a new graph-based cross-modal retrieval method named graph correlation analysis with ranking loss that finds the latent information in multimodal data. We use graph convolutional networks to dig the deep latent information in modalities and represent the data in finer granularity. It uses visual and physiological information to estimate whether the food that a user tries to obtain is diabetogenic or not, and feeds back the reasons in detail. Extensive experiments on the MSCOCO data set and the new proposed multimodal diabetogenic food database real-life diabetogenic show that the proposed cross-modal retrieval method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and CMRDF can achieve reliable results on preventing diabetic patients from inappropriate food.

AB  - With the rapid development in smart medical devices, internet of things has a large applicability in the healthcare sector. The current system is based on a centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases security and privacy risks. This paper describes an architecture of a smart healthcare system for remote patient monitoring. To ensure security and privacy, the architecture uses blockchain technology. For data analysis, smart contracts and artificial intelligence are used. The architecture is divided into three layers: smart medical devices layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. To validate the proposed approach, a scenario based on diabetes management system is described. The architecture is applied to provide remote diabetic patient monitoring. The system could suggest treatments, generate proactive predictions, and predict future complications as well as alerting physicians in case of emergency.

AB  - Practical tools which can be quickly administered are needed for measuring subtle changes in cognitive-motor performance over time. Frailty together with cognitive impairment, or 'cognitive frailty', are shown to be strong and independent predictors of cognitive decline over time. We have developed an interactive instrumented trail-making task (iTMT) platform, which allows quantification of motor planning error (MPE) through a series of ankle reaching tasks. In this study, we examined the accuracy of MPE in identifying cognitive frailty in older adults. Thirty-two older adults (age = 77.3 +/- 9.1 years, body-mass-index = 25.3 +/- 4.7 kg/m(2), female = 38%) were recruited. Using either the Mini-Mental State Examination or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 16 subjects were classified as cognitive-intact and 16 were classified as cognitive-impaired. In addition, 12 young-healthy subjects (age = 26.0 +/- 5.2 years, body-mass-index = 25.3 +/- 3.9 kg/m(2), female = 33%) were recruited to establish a healthy benchmark. Subjects completed the iTMT, using an ankle-worn sensor, which transforms ankle motion into navigation of a computer cursor. The iTMT task included reaching five indexed target circles (including numbers 1-to-3 and letters A&B placed in random order) on the computer-screen by moving the ankle-joint while standing. The ankle-sensor quantifies MPE through analysis of the pattern of ankle velocity. MPE was defined as percentage of time deviation between subject's maximum ankle velocity and the optimal maximum ankle velocity, which is halfway through the reaching pathway. Data from gait tests, including single task and dual task walking, were also collected to determine cognitive-motor performance. The average MPE in young-healthy, elderly cognitive-intact, and elderly cognitive-impaired groups was 11.1 +/- 5.7%, 20.3 +/- 9.6%, and 34.1 +/- 4.2% (p < 0.001), respectively. Large effect sizes (Cohen's d = 1.17-4.56) were observed for discriminating between groups using MPE. Significant correlations were observed between the MPE and MoCA score (r = 0.670, p < 0.001) as well as between the MPE and dual task stride velocity (r = 0.584, p < 0.001). This study demonstrated feasibility and efficacy of estimating MPE from a practical wearable platform with promising results in identifying cognitive-motor impairment and potential application in assessing cognitive frailty. The proposed platform could be also used as an alternative to dual task walking test, where gait assessment may not be practical. Future studies need to confirm these observations in larger samples.

AB  - Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices are massively interconnected, which generates a massive amount of network traffic. The concept of edge computing brings a new paradigm to monitor and manage network traffic at the network's edge. Network traffic classification is a critical task to monitor and identify Internet traffic. Recent traffic classification works suggested using statistical flow features to classify network traffic accurately using machine learning techniques. The selected classification features must be stable and can work across different spatial and temporal heterogeneity. This paper proposes a feature selection mechanism called Ensemble Weight Approach (EWA) for selecting significant features for Internet traffic classification based on multi-criterion ranking and selection mechanisms. Extensive simulations have been conducted using publicly-available traces from the University of Cambridge. The simulation results demonstrate that EWA is capable of identifying stable features subset for Internet traffic identification. EWA-selected features improve the mean accuracy up to 1.3% and reduce RMSE using fewer features than other feature selection methods. The smaller number of features directly contributes to shorter classification time. Furthermore, the selected features can train stable traffic classification generative models irrespective of the dataset's spatial and temporal differences, with consistent accuracy up to 97%. The overall performance indicates that EWA-selected statistical flow features can improve the overall traffic classification.

AB  - Rehabilitation of stroke survivors can be expedited by employing an exoskeleton. The exercises are designed such that both hands move in synergy. In this regard, often, motion capture data from the healthy hand is used to derive control behavior for the exoskeleton. Therefore, data gloves can provide a low-cost solution for the motion capture of the joints in the hand. However, current data gloves are bulky, inaccurate, or inconsistent. These disadvantages are inherited because the conventional design of a glove involves an external attachment that degrades overtime and causes inaccuracies. This article presents a weft knit data glove whose sensors and support structure are manufactured in the same fabrication process, thus removing the need for an external attachment. The glove is made by knitting multifilament conductive yarn and an elastomeric yarn using WholeGarment technology. Furthermore, we present a detailed electromechanical model of the sensors alongside its experimental validation. In addition, the reliability of the glove is verified experimentally. Finally, machine learning algorithms are implemented for classifying the posture of hand on the basis of sensor data histograms.

AB  - There are no clear guidelines for diuretic administration in heart failure (HF), and reliable markers are needed to tailor treatment. Continuous monitoring of multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients' responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF.

AB  - Background: Sedentary behaviors are associated to the development of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Accelerometers and inclinometers have been used to estimate sedentary behaviors, however a major limitation is that these devices do not provide enough contextual information in order to recognize the specific sedentary behavior performed, e.g., sitting or lying watching TV, using the PC, sitting at work, driving, etc.
   Objective: Propose and evaluate the precision of a mobile system for objectively measuring six sedentary behaviors using accelerometer and location data.
   Results: The system is implemented as an Android Mobile App, which identifies individual's sedentary behaviors based on accelerometer data taken from the smartphone or a smartwatch, and symbolic location data obtained from Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons. The system infers sedentary behaviors by means of a supervised Machine Learning Classifier. The precision of the classification of five of the six studied sedentary behaviors exceeded 95% using accelerometer data from a smartwatch attached to the wrist and 98% using accelerometer data from a smartphone put into the pocket. Statistically significant improvement in the average precision of the classification due to the use of BLE beacons was found by comparing the precision of the classification using accelerometer data only, and BLE beacons localization technology.
   Conclusions: The proposed system provides contextual information of specific sedentary behaviors by inferring with very high precision the physical location where the sedentary event occurs. Moreover, it was found that, when accelerometers are put in the user's pocket, instead of the wrist and, when symbolic location is inferred using BLE beacons; the precision in the classification is improved. In practice, the proposed system has the potential to contribute to the understanding of the context and determinants of sedentary behaviors, necessary for the implementation and monitoring of personalized noncommunicable diseases prevention programs, for instance, sending sedentary behavior alerts, or providing personalized recommendations on physical activity. The system could be used at work to promote active breaks and healthy habits. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Precision health relies on the ability to assess disease risk at an individual level, detect early preclinical conditions and initiate preventive strategies. Recent technological advances in omics and wearable monitoring enable deep molecular and physiological profiling and may provide important tools for precision health. We explored the ability of deep longitudinal profiling to make health-related discoveries, identify clinically relevant molecular pathways and affect behavior in a prospective longitudinal cohort (n = 109) enriched for risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The cohort underwent integrative personalized omics profiling from samples collected quarterly for up to 8 years (median, 2.8 years) using clinical measures and emerging technologies including genome, immunome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, microbiome and wearable monitoring. We discovered more than 67 clinically actionable health discoveries and identified multiple molecular pathways associated with metabolic, cardiovascular and oncologic pathophysiology. We developed prediction models for insulin resistance by using omics measurements, illustrating their potential to replace burdensome tests. Finally, study participation led the majority of participants to implement diet and exercise changes. Altogether, we conclude that deep longitudinal profiling can lead to actionable health discoveries and provide relevant information for precision health.

AB  - In times of smart products and systems, the Internet of Things (IoT) plays an increasingly important role. IoT combines the digital world (interna) with the physical world (sensors, actuators, robots, smartphones, connected cars etc.). The autonomous operation and remote control of smart systems (e.g. smart home, production hall or line) requires efficient and specially reliable actuators and control mechanisms. Shape memory actuators are particularly suitable for this application due to their properties as they are lightweight, small, energy-efficient and can also be used as sensors at the same time. Many shape memory actuators have been developed for various applications over the past years. Despite great interest, there are no standardized test programs available. The complexity of the shape memory technology is a major challenge in testing fatigue and degradation behavior of components to determine reliability. This article presents fatigue test results of a laboratory test rig of a case study for a shape memory actuator, including all boundary conditions and test requirements. The measurement data consists of different parameters e.g. the stroke of the actuator, the electrical voltage and current (to activate the actuator) as well as the ambient temperature. Since the study comprises only a few prototypes, parametric methods are not suitable for a comprehensive evaluation, therefore parameter-free methods are used as well. The analysis regarding the description of dependencies between the recorded signals and the detection of degradation of the shape memory actuators is discussed in detail. The main objective is the development of a prognosis algorithm in order to be able to predict the failure behaviour of the actuators at an early stage. The methodical approach includes various methods and procedures, which are applied in a logical order. The statistical analytics used in this study are focusing on nonparametric significance tests, such as the Levene's test and the u-test by Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney. Further methods are the correlation analysis and the regression analysis as well as multivariate 3D-plots. The fundamentals of shape memory alloys, as well as the used statistical nonparametric methods, are described briefly. Finally, the realization (application of the analysis methods) based on the real test rig data of a case study consisting of 18 actuators is shown and discussed in detail.

AB  - Background Advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by progressive weight loss and nutritional deterioration. This wasting has been linked to poor survival outcomes, alterations in host defenses, decreased functional ability, and diminished health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pancreatic cancer patients. There are currently no standardized approaches to the management of pancreatic cancer cachexia. This study explores the feasibility and efficacy of enteral tube feeding of a peptide-based formula to improve weight stability and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in advanced PDAC patients with cachexia. Methods This was a single-institution, single-arm prospective trial conducted between April 2015 and March 2019. Eligible patients were adults (>18 years) diagnosed with advanced or locally advanced PDAC and cachexia, defined as greater than 5% unexplained weight loss within 6 months from screening. The study intervention included three 28 day cycles of a semi-elemental peptide-based formula, administered through a jejunal or gastrojejunal feeding tube. The primary outcome was weight stability at 3 months (Cycle 3), defined as weight change less than 0.1 kg/baseline BMI unit from baseline. Secondary outcomes included changes in lean body mass, appendicular lean mass, bone mineral density, fat mass, and percent body fat, as measured with a DEXA scan, HRQOL (EORTC QLQC30) and NIH PROMIS PROs assessed at each cycle. Daily activity (steps, distance, active minutes, heart rate, and sleep) were remotely monitored using a wearable activity monitor (Fitbit) over the 3 month study period. Results Thirty-six patients were screened for eligibility, 31 patients consented onto study and underwent jejunal tube placement, and 16 patients completed treatment: mean age 67 years (SD 9.3), 43.8% male. Among evaluable patients (n = 16), weight stability was achieved in 10 patients (62.5%), thus completing the trial early. Increases in lean body mass (1273.1, SD: 4078, P = 0.01) and appendicular lean mass (0.45, SD: 0.6, P = 0.02) were observed. Statistically significant improvements at Cycle 3 from baseline were also observed for QLQC30 role function [mean difference (MD): 20.1, P = 0.03], appetite (MD: 27.4, P = 0.02), and global health scores (MD: 13.3, P = 0.05) as well as for NIH PROMIS t-scores for depression (MD: -10.4, P = 0.006) and pain interference (MD: -7.5, P = 0.05). Objectively monitored (Fitbit) activity levels increased, although statistical significance was not reached. Conclusions Our findings suggest that enteral nutrition support may improve weight stability, lean body mass, appendicular lean mass and PROs in PDAC patients with cachexia who completed treatment, representing a subsample of the study population. The feasibility and role of enteral feeding in routine care remain unclear, and larger and randomized controlled trials are warranted.

AB  - Heart-sound auscultation is a rapid and fundamental technique used for examining the cardiovascular system. The main components of heart sounds are the first and second heart sounds. Discriminating these heart sounds under the presence of additional heart sounds and murmurs will be difficult. To recognize these signals efficiently, this study proposes a monitoring system with phonocardiogram and electrocardiogram. This system has two key points. The first is chip implementation, including capacitor coupled amplifier, transimpedance amplifier, high-pass sigma-delta modulator, and digital signal processing block. The chip in the system is fabricated in 0.18 m standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process. The second is a software application on smartphones for heart-related physiological signal recording, display, and identification. A wavelet-based QRS complex detection algorithm verified by MIT/BIH Arrhythmia Database is also proposed. The overall measured positive prediction, sensitivity, and error rate of the proposed algorithm are 99.90, 99.82, and 0.28, respectively. During auscultation, doctors may refer to these physiological signals displayed on the smartphone and simultaneously listen to the heart sounds to diagnose the potential heart disease. By taking advantage of signal visualization and keeping the original diagnosis procedure, the uncertainty existing in heart sounds can be eliminated, and the training period to acquire auscultation skills can be reduced.

AB  - Assessing the efficacy of cancer therapeutics in mouse models is a critical step in treatment development. However, low-resolution measurement tools and small sample sizes make determining drug efficacy in vivo a difficult and time-intensive task. Here, we present a commercially scalable wearable electronic strain sensor that automates the in vivo testing of cancer therapeutics by continuously monitoring the micrometer-scale progression or regression of subcutaneously implanted tumors at the minute time scale. In two in vivo cancer mouse models, our sensor discerned differences in tumor volume dynamics between drug- and vehicle-treated tumors within 5 hours following therapy initiation. These short-term regression measurements were validated through histology, and caliper and bioluminescence measurements taken over weeklong treatment periods demonstrated the correlation with longer-term treatment response. We anticipate that real-time tumor regression datasets could help expedite and automate the process of screening cancer therapies in vivo.

AB  - Aims: The aim was to validate the performance of a monitoring system consisting of a wrist-worn device and a data management cloud service intended to be used by medical professionals in detecting atrial fibrillation (AF).
   Methods: Thirty adult patients diagnosed with AF alone or AF with concomitant flutter were recruited. Continuous photoplethysmogram (PPG) and intermittent 30 s Lead I electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were collected over 48 h. The ECG was measured four times a day at prescheduled times, when notified due to irregular rhythm detected by PPG, and when self-initiated based on symptoms. Three-channel Holter ECG was used as the reference.
   Results: The subjects recorded a total of 1,415 h of continuous PPG data and 3.8 h of intermittent ECG data over the study period. The PPG data were analyzed by the system's algorithm in 5-min segments. The segments containing adequate amounts, at least similar to 30 s, of adequate quality PPG data for rhythm assessment algorithm, were included. After rejecting 46% of the 5-min segments, the remaining data were compared with annotated Holter ECG yielding AF detection sensitivity and specificity of 95.6 and 99.2%, respectively. The ECG analysis algorithm labeled 10% of the 30-s ECG records as inadequate quality and these were excluded from the analysis. The ECG AF detection sensitivity and specificity were 97.7 and 89.8%, respectively. The usability of the system was found to be good by both the study subjects and the participating cardiologists.
   Conclusion: The system comprising of a wrist device and a data management service was validated to be suitable for use in patient monitoring and in the detection of AF in an ambulatory setting.

AB  - Context: The hybrid assistive limb (HAL) (the wearable robot) can assist kinesis during voluntary control of hip and knee joint motion by detecting the wearer's bioelectric signals on the surface of their skin. The purpose of this study was to report on walking ability following the wearable robot treatment in a patient with chronic myelopathy after surgery for cervical ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
   Findings: The patient was a 66-year-old woman with cervical OPLL who was able to ambulate independently with the aid of bilateral crutches. The wearable robot treatment was received once every 2 weeks for ten sessions beginning approximately 14 years after surgery. Improvements were observed in gait speed (BL 22.5; post 46.7 m/min), step length (BL 0.36; post 0.57 m), and cadence (BL 61.9; post 81.6 m/min) based on a 10-m walk test and a 2-minute walk test (BL 63.4; post 103.7 m) assessing total walking distance. The improvements in walking ability were maintained after the wearable robot treatment for 6 months.
   Conclusion: We report the functional recovery in the walking ability of a patient with chronic cervical myelopathy following the wearable robot treatment, suggesting that as a rehabilitation tool, the wearable robot has the potential to effectively improve functional ambulation in chronic cervical myelopathy patients whose walking ability has plateaued, even many years after surgery.

AB  - BackgroundInertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-based wearable sensors have found common use to track arm activity in daily life. However, classifying a high number of arm motions with single IMU-based systems still remains a challenging task. This paper explores the possibility to increase the classification accuracy of these systems by incorporating a thermal sensor. Increasing the number of arm motions that can be classified is relevant to increasing applicability of single-device wearable systems for a variety of applications, including activity monitoring for athletes, gesture control for video games, and motion classification for physical rehabilitation patients. This study explores whether a thermal sensor can increase the classification accuracy of a single-device motion classification system when evaluated with healthy participants. The motions performed are reproductions of exercises described in established rehabilitation protocols.MethodsA single wrist-mounted device was built with an inertial sensor and a thermal sensor. This device was worn on the wrist, was battery powered, and transmitted data over Bluetooth to computer during recording. A LabVIEW Graphical User Interface (GUI) instructed the user to complete 24 different arm motions in a pre-randomized order. The received data were pre-processed, and secondary features were calculated on these data. These features were processed with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and then several machine learning models were applied to select the optimal model based on speed and accuracy. To test the effectiveness of the scheme, 11 healthy subjects participated in the trials.ResultsAverage personalized classification model accuracies of 93.55% were obtained for 11 healthy participants. Generalized model accuracies of 82.5% indicated that the device can classify arm motions on a user without prior training. The addition of a thermal sensor significantly increased classification accuracy of a single wrist-mounted inertial device, from 75 to 93.55%, (F(1,20)=90.53, p=7.25e-09).ConclusionThis study found that the addition of the thermal sensor improved the classification accuracy of 24 arm motions from 75 to 93.55% for a single-device system. Our results provide evidence that a single device can be used to classify a relatively large number of arm motions from arm rehabilitation protocols. While this study provides a conceptual proof-of-concept with a healthy population, additional investigation is required to evaluate the performance of this system for specific applications, such as activity classification for physically affected stroke survivors undergoing home-based rehabilitation.

AB  - In this paper, we demonstrate a system for locating missing entities using radio-frequency identification (RFID)based techniques. A key feature of our system is that we utilize the large, high-density networks of parked vehicles incident to urban areas for the detection and reporting process. RFID readers and antennas are placed within the vehicles, while RFID passive tags are carried on the entity of interest via some means, e.g., a wrist band. If an entity is reported as missing, then the application on board each of the parked vehicles is awoken by an administrative center. The technology on board the vehicles enables those participating in the service to attempt to locate the missing entity, sending useful information back to the administration center, which could be tied to an organization like the police. We demonstrate our system via a use case of a missing Alzheimer's patient in inner-city Dublin, Ireland. One of the key challenges in validating our system is being able to replicate a large-scale, real-world setting. Our technique for obtaining an early evaluation of our system thus employs the use of the microscopic traffic simulation package Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO). SUMO permits multiple emulations of hundreds or thousands of parked vehicles participating in the service to be carried out, while simulated pedestrians walk random routes. Our results show that a simulated wandering person in need can be detected within a 30-min time frame, in the heart of Dublin city center, during a typical weekday, up to approximately 98% of the time, depending on how various parameters of the system are set.

AB  - Recent advances in flexible materials, nanomanufacturing, and system integration have provided a great opportunity to develop wearable flexible hybrid electronics for human healthcare, diagnostics, and therapeutics. However, existing medical devices still rely on rigid electronics with many wires and separate components, which hinders wireless, comfortable, continuous monitoring of health-related human motions. Advanced materials and system integration technologies are introduced that enable soft, active wireless, thin-film bioelectronics. This low-modulus, highly flexible wearable electronic system incorporates a nanomembrane wireless circuit and functional chip components enclosed by a soft elastomeric membrane. It can be gently and seamlessly mounted on the skin, while offering comfortable, highly sensitive and accurate detection of head movements. The wireless, skin-like bioelectronic system (SKINTRONICS) is utilized for quantitative diagnostics of cervical dystonia (CD), which is characterized by involuntary abnormal head postures and repetitive head movements, sometimes with neck muscle pain. A set of analytical and experimental studies shows a soft system packaging, hard-soft materials integration, and quantitative assessment of physiological signals detected by the SKINTRONICS. In vivo demonstration, involving 10 human subjects, finds the device feasible for use in CD measurement.

AB  - Objective: Dyspnea, also known as the patient's feeling of difficult or labored breathing, is one of the most common symptoms for respiratory disorders. Dyspnea is usually self-reported by patients using, for example, the Borg scale from 0 - 10, which is however subjective and problematic for those who refuse to cooperate or cannot communicate. The objective of this paper was to develop a learning-based model that can evaluate the correlation between the self-report Borg score and the respiratory metrics for dyspnea induced by exertion and increased airway resistance. Methods: A non-invasive wearable radio-frequency sensor by near-field coherent sensing was employed to retrieve continuous respiratory data with user comfort and convenience. Self-report dyspnea scores and respiratory features were collected on 32 healthy participants going through various physical and breathing exercises. A machine learning model based on the decision tree and random forest then produced an objective dyspnea score. Results: For unseen data as well as unseen participants, the objective dyspnea score can be in reasonable agreement with the self-report score, and the importance factor of each respiratory metrics can be assessed. Conclusion: An objective dyspnea score can potentially complement or substitute the self-report for physiologically induced dyspnea. Significance: The method can potentially formulate a baseline for clinical dyspnea assessment and help caregivers track dyspnea continuously, especially for patients who cannot report themselves.

AB  - The use of accelerometers in physical activity (PA) research has increased exponentially over the past 20 yr. The first commercially available accelerometer for assessing PA, the Caltrac, was worn on the waist and estimated PA energy expenditure in kilocalories. Around 1995, the emphasis shifted to measuring minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), especially for bouts of 10 min or longer. Recent studies, however, show that light-intensity PA and intermittent (nonbout) MVPA also have important health benefits. The total volume of PA performed is an important variable because it takes the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity bouts and condenses them down into a single metric. The total volume of PA is appropriate for many research applications and can enhance comparisons between studies. In the future, machine learning algorithms will provide improved accuracy for activity type recognition and estimation of PA energy expenditure. However, in the current landscape of objectively measured PA, total activity counts per day (TAC/d) is a proxy for the total volume of PA. TAC/d percentiles for age- and gender-specific groups have been developed from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ActiGraph data (2003-2006), providing a novel way to assess PA. The use of TAC/d or standardized units of acceleration could harmonize PA across studies. TAC/d should be viewed as an additional metric, not intended to replace other metrics (e.g., sedentary time, light-intensity PA, moderate PA, and vigorous PA) that may also be related to health. As future refinements to wearable monitors occur, researchers should continue to consider metrics that reflect the total volume of PA in addition to existing PA metrics.

AB  - Recent advances in miniaturized nano-based devices are rapidly extending the boundaries of biomedical technologies, particularly biosensors. Highly selective biosensors with the ability to simultaneously detect multiple targets were developed in recent years. The most eye-catching classifications of such biosensors coupled with the emergence of stimuli-responsive and CRISPR/Cas-sensitive systems. Furthermore, attractive features of wearable and implantable biosensors have led to the design of portable, remote controllable diagnostic systems for tackling healthcare challenges in every part of the world, especially in places with limited access to clinical resources. Nevertheless, there are still some barriers to widespread applications of biosensors due mainly to their high costs and the lack of a single biosensing device for highly selective targeting of multiple analytes. Herein, we review the latest developments in biomedical technologies with a focus on biosensors including smart stimuli-responsive, CRISPR/Cas-sensitive, wearable, and implantable biosensors to spark innovations in this field.

AB  - Being able to monitor the heart will allow the diagnosis of heart diseases for patients during daily activities, and the detection of burden on the heart during strenuous exercise. Furthermore, with the help of U-health technology, immediate medical action can be taken, in the case of abnormal symptoms of the heart in daily life. Therefore, it appears to be necessary to develop the corresponding technology to monitor the condition of the heart daily. In this study, a novel wearable smart system was proposed, to monitor the activity of the heart in daily life, and to further evaluate the rhythm of arrhythmia. The wearable system includes three modified bipolar conductive fiber electrodes in the chest part, which can resolve the reduction problem of the magnitude of the signal, by magnifying the signal and removing the noise, to obtain high affinity and validity for medical-type usage (<0.903%). The biological signal acquisition and data lines, and the signal processing engine and communication consist of a conductive ink, and the pic18 and ANT protocol nRF24AP2, respectively. The proposed algorithm was able to detect a strong ECG, signal and r-point passing over the noise. The confidence intervals were 96%, which could satisfy the requirement to detect arrhythmia under the unconstrained conditions.

AB  - This cohort study tests a frailty meter that does not rely on gait to determine the risk of 30-day major adverse events among patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia who have undergone lower extremity revascularization.
   Question Is a wrist-worn frailty meter (FM) that quantifies physical frailty using a 20-second repetitive elbow flexion-extension test a feasible tool for evaluating the risk of 30-day major adverse events (MAEs) after lower-limb revascularization? Findings In this 2-center cohort-study of 152 patients, all participants were able to perform the FM test within 1 week before revascularization, whereas most were unable to perform a gait test because of the presence of foot ulcers. The FM distinguished between those with and without 30-day MAEs. Meaning The results of this study suggest that the FM is feasible and may support surgeons in evaluating the risks and benefits of revascularization in older adults.
   Importance Physical frailty is a key risk factor associated with higher rates of major adverse events (MAEs) after surgery. Assessing physical frailty is often challenging among patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) who are often unable to perform gait-based assessments because of the presence of plantar wounds. Objective To test a frailty meter (FM) that does not rely on gait to determine the risk of occurrence of MAEs after revascularization for patients with CLTI. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included 184 consecutively recruited patients with CLTI at 2 tertiary care centers. After 32 individuals were excluded, 152 participants were included in the study. Data collection was conducted between May 2018 and June 2019. Exposures Physical frailty measurement within 1 week before limb revascularization and incidence of MAEs for as long as 1 month after surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures The FM works by quantifying weakness, slowness, rigidity, and exhaustion during a 20-second repetitive elbow flexion-extension exercise using a wrist-worn sensor. The FM generates a frailty index (FI) ranging from 0 to 1; higher values indicate progressively greater severity of physical frailty. Results Of 152 eligible participants (mean [SD] age, 67.0 [11.8] years; 59 [38.8%] women), 119 (78.2%) were unable to perform the gait test, while all could perform the FM test. Overall, 53 (34.9%), 58 (38.1%), and 41 (27.0%) were classified as robust (FI <0.20), prefrail (FI >= 0.20 to <0.35), or frail (FI >= 0.35), respectively. Within 30 days after surgery, 24 (15.7%) developed MAEs, either major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; 8 [5.2%]) or major adverse limb events (MALE; 16 [10.5%]). Baseline demographic characteristics were not significantly different between frailty groups. In contrast, the FI was approximately 30% higher in the group that developed MAEs (mean [SD] score, 0.36 [0.14]) than those who were MAE free (mean [SD] score, 0.26 [0.13]; P = .001), with observed MAE rates of 4 patients (7.5%), 7 patients (12.1%), and 13 patients (31.7%) in the robust, prefrail and frail groups, respectively (P = .004). The FI distinguished individuals who developed MACE and MALE from those who were MAE free (MACE: mean [SD] FI score, 0.38 [0.16]; P = .03; MALE: mean [SD] FI score, 0.35 [0.13]; P = .004) after adjusting by body mass index. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, measuring physical frailty using a wrist-worn sensor during a short upper extremity test was a practical method for stratifying the risk of MAEs following revascularization for CLTI when the administration of gait-based tests is often challenging.

AB  - Background: Construction work frequently involves heavy physical work, and a reduction of the physical workload should have high priority. Technological development has made it possible to obtain field measurements with surface electromyography (sEMG), kinematics measured with inertial measurement units (IMUs), and video recordings. However, no studies have used these methods simultaneously to detect situations with excessive physical workload (events) during a working day. Thus, knowledge about these specific events may combat work-related risk factors. Participatory ergonomics (PE) has shown promising results, but whether it can be used as a tool to reduce the physical workload during construction work remains unknown.
   Objective: This cluster randomized controlled trial investigated whether a PE intervention with technical measurements consisting of IMUs, sEMG, heart rate monitoring, and video recordings of physical workload could reduce the number of events with excessive physical workload during a working day. Furthermore, other outcomes were obtained from questionnaires.
   Methods: A total of 80 male full-time construction workers (aged 19 to 67 years) were randomized at the cluster level (gang) to a PE intervention consisting of 3 workshops (7 gangs and 32 workers) or to a control group (8 gangs and 48 workers). The physical workload was recorded by technical measurements, that is, IMUs, sEMG, heart rate monitoring, and video recordings during a full working day at baseline and 3 and 6 months' follow-up. On the basis of the technical measurements, a custom-made computer program detected the situations (events) where the construction workers were exposed to excessive physical workload and used in the intervention. Differences in the number of events from baseline to follow-up between intervention and control were evaluated using linear mixed models (intention-to-treat), with individual nested in cluster as a random factor. Furthermore, questionnaires were filled out on test days.
   Results: The results of the primary outcome showed no change in the number of events with excessive physical workload. However, compared with the control group, the other outcomes showed decreased general fatigue after a typical working day (P=. 001) and increased influence on own work (P=. 04).
   Conclusions: This PE intervention with technical measurements did not reduce the number of events with excessive physical workload during construction work. However, the intervention led to decreased general fatigue and increased influence on own work.

AB  - Among the wearable sensor family, the triboelectric nanogenerator has excellent potential in human healthcare systems due to its small size, self-powered, and low cost. Here is the design and simulation of the triboelectric nanogenerator using the 3D model in COMSOL Multiphysics software for blood pressure measurement. As a reliable indicator of human physiological health, blood pressure (BP) has been utilized in more and more cases to predict and diagnose potential diseases and the dysfunction caused by hypertension. The main focus of this study is to prognosis and preserve human health against BP. It is one of the significant challenges in predicting and diagnosing BP in the human lifestyle. The self-powered triboelectric nanogenerator can diagnose BP using the wrist pulse pressure. To optimize the performance of the modeled triboelectric nanogenerator, the known wrist pulse pressure is applied explicitly, which converts the applied pressure into an equivalent electrical signal across the output terminals. An output open circuit voltage for the applied pulse pressure is 26 V. The generated output electrical signal is proportional to the applied pulse pressure, which is used to know the BP range. It ensures that the triboelectric nanogenerator is an opted sensor to sense the minute nadi pressure signal. This work validates that the simulated model has the potential to act as several health care monitors such as respiratory rate, heart rate, glucose range, joint motion sensing, gait, and CO2 detectors.

AB  - The technological evolution and widespread availability of wearables and handheld ECG devices capable of screening for atrial fibrillation (AF), and their promotion directly to consumers, has focused attention of health care professionals and patient organizations on consumer-led AF screening. In this Frontiers review, members of the AF-SCREEN International Collaboration provide a critical appraisal of this rapidly evolving field to increase awareness of the complexities and uncertainties surrounding consumer-led AF screening. Although there are numerous commercially available devices directly marketed to consumers for AF monitoring and identification of unrecognized AF, health care professional-led randomized controlled studies using multiple ECG recordings or continuous ECG monitoring to detect AF have failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in stroke. Although it remains uncertain if consumer-led AF screening reduces stroke, it could increase early diagnosis of AF and facilitate an integrated approach, including appropriate anticoagulation, rate or rhythm management, and risk factor modification to reduce complications. Companies marketing AF screening devices should report the accuracy and performance of their products in high- and low-risk populations and avoid claims about clinical outcomes unless improvement is demonstrated in randomized clinical trials. Generally, the diagnostic yield of AF screening increases with the number, duration, and temporal dispersion of screening sessions, but the prognostic importance may be less than for AF detected by single-time point screening, which is largely permanent, persistent, or high-burden paroxysmal AF. Consumer-initiated ECG recordings suggesting possible AF always require confirmation by a health care professional experienced in ECG reading, whereas suspicion of AF on the basis of photoplethysmography must be confirmed with an ECG. Consumer-led AF screening is unlikely to be cost-effective for stroke prevention in the predominantly young, early adopters of this technology. Studies in older people at higher stroke risk are required to demonstrate both effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The direct interaction between companies and consumers creates new regulatory gaps in relation to data privacy and the registration of consumer apps and devices. Although several barriers for optimal use of consumer-led screening exist, results of large, ongoing trials, powered to detect clinical outcomes, are required before health care professionals should support widespread adoption of consumer-led AF screening.

AB  - Coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) have been reported to associate with an increased risk for thrombosis. Distinct to the brain aneurysm, which can cause a rupture, CAA's threat is more about its potential to induce thrombosis, leading to myocardial infarction. Case reports suggest that thrombosis risk varied with the different CAA diameters and hemodynamics effects (usually wall shear stress (WSS), oscillatory shear index (OSI), and relative residence time (RRT)) may relate to the thrombosis risk. However, currently, due to the rareness of the disease, there is limited knowledge of the hemodynamics effects of CAA. The aim of the study was to estimate the relationship between hemodynamic effects and different diameters of CAAs. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides a noninvasive means of hemodynamic research. Four three-dimensional models were constructed, representing coronary arteries with a normal diameter (1x) and CAAs with diameters two (2x), three (3x), and five times (5x) that of the normal diameter. A lumped parameter model (LPM) which can capture the feature of coronary blood flow supplied the boundary conditions. WSS in the aneurysm decreased 97.7% apparently from 3.51 Pa (1x) to 0.08 Pa (5x). OSI and RRT in the aneurysm were increased apparently by two orders of magnitude from 0.01 (1x) to 0.30 (5x), and from 0.38 Pa-1 (1x) to 51.59 Pa-1 (5x), separately. Changes in the local volume of the CAA resulted in dramatic changes in local hemodynamic parameters. The findings demonstrated that thrombosis risk increased with increasing diameter and was strongly exacerbated at larger diameters of CAA. The 2x model exhibited the lowest thrombosis risk among the models, suggesting the low-damage (medication) treatment may work. High-damage (surgery) treatment may need to be considered when CAA diameter is 3 times or higher. This diameter classification method may be a good example for constructing a more complex hemodynamic-based risk stratification method and could support clinical decision-making in the assessment of CAA.

AB  - Background: There is growing interest in the area of "wearable tech" and its relationship to health. A common element of many of these devices is a triaxial accelerometer that can yield continuous information on gross motor activity levels; how such data might predict changes in health is less clear.
   Methods: We examined accelerometry data from 2,976 older men who were part of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study. Using a shape-naive technique, functional principal component analysis, we examined the patterns of motor activity over the course of 4-7 days and determined whether these patterns were associated with changes in polysomnographic-determined sleep and cognitive function (Trail Making Test-Part B [Trails B], Modified Mini-Mental State Examination [3MS]), as well as mortality over 6.5-8 years of follow-up.
   Results: In comparing baseline to 6.5 years later, multivariate modeling indicated that low daytime activity at baseline was associated with worsening of sleep efficiency (p < .05), more wake after sleep onset (p < .05), and a decrease in cognition (Trails B; p < .001), as well as a 1.6-fold higher rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.64 [1.34-2.00]). Earlier wake and bed times were associated with a decrease in cognition (3MS; p < .05). Having a late afternoon peak in activity was associated with a 1.4-fold higher rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio = 1.46 [1.21-1.77]). Those having a longer duration of their daytime activity with a bimodal activity pattern also had over a 1.4-fold higher rate of cardiovascular-related mortality (hazard ratio = 1.42 [1.02-1.98]).
   Conclusions: Patterns of daily activity may be useful as predictive biomarkers for changes in clinically relevant outcomes, including mortality and changes in sleep and cognition in older men.

AB  - Background: Baseline physical activity in patients when they initiate cardiac rehabilitation is poorly understood. We used mobile health technology to understand baseline physical activity of patients initiating cardiac rehabilitation within a clinical trial to potentially inform personalized care.
   Methods: The VALENTINE (Virtual Application-Supported Environment to Increase Exercise During Cardiac Rehabilitation Study) is a prospective, randomized-controlled, remotely administered trial designed to evaluate a mobile health intervention to supplement cardiac rehabilitation for low- and moderate-risk patients. All participants receive a smartwatch and usual care. Baseline physical activity was assessed remotely after enrollment and included (1) 6-minute walk distance, (2) daily step count, and (3) daily exercise minutes, both over 7 days and for compliant days, defined by >8 hours of watch wear time. Multivariable linear regression identified patient-level features associated with these 3 measures of baseline physical activity.
   Results: From October 2020 to March 2022, 220 participants enrolled in the study. Participants are mostly White (184 [83.6%]); 67 (30.5%) are female and 84 (38.2%) are >65 years old. Most participants enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation after percutaneous coronary intervention (105 [47.7%]) or coronary artery bypass surgery (39 [17.7 %]). Clinical diagnoses include coronary artery disease (78.6%), heart failure (17.3%), and valve repair or replacement (26.4%). Baseline mean 6-minute walk distance was 489.6 (SD, 143.4) meters, daily step count was 6845 (SD, 3353), and exercise minutes was 37.5 (SD, 33.5). In a multivariable model, 6-minute walk distance was significantly associated with age and sex, but not cardiac rehabilitation indication. Sex but not age or cardiac rehabilitation indication was significantly associated with daily step count and exercise minutes.
   Conclusions: Baseline physical activity varies substantially in low- and moderate-risk patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation. Future studies are warranted to explore whether personalizing cardiac rehabilitation programs using mobile health technologies could optimize recovery.

AB  - Background: Exercise is predicted to have a positive effect among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. However, these patients are hesitant to start and build up an exercise program for one major reason: the vague fear of developing hepatic decompensation, a potentially fatal condition that can lead to death. Integrating mobile health (mHealth) with individualized exercise programs could be a possible option for promoting physical capacity among HCC patients.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rehabilitation exercises, which have been individually prescribed via an mHealth app, on physical fitness, body composition, biochemical profile, and quality of life among HCC patients.
   Methods: A total of 37 HCC patients were enrolled in a 12-week course with an mHealth app program targeted to HCC patients. The wearable wristband device Neofit (Partron Co) was provided to participants, and recorded daily physical data, such as the number of steps, calorie expenditure, exercise time, and heart rate. Each participant was given an individualized rehabilitation exercise program that was prescribed and adjusted at the 6-week midintervention period based on the assessment results. At baseline, 6-week, and 12-week sessions, participants' physical fitness levels (ie, 6-minute walk test, grip strength test, and 30-second chair stand test) were measured. Physical activity levels, as measured by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF); body composition (ie, body mass index, body fat percentage, and muscle mass); biochemical profiles; and quality of life, as measured by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C30, were assessed at baseline and at the end point. At the 6-week midpoint, exercise intensity was individually adjusted.
   Results: Of the 37 patients, 31 (84%) completed the 12-week intervention. Grip strength improved significantly after 12 weeks of the intervention. The 30-second chair stand test and the 6-minute walk test showed significant improvement from 0 to 6 weeks, from 0 to 12 weeks, and from 6 to 12 weeks. Muscle mass and the IPAQ-SF score increased significantly after 12 weeks of the intervention without biochemical deterioration.
   Conclusions: Following 12 weeks of mHealth care, including an individually prescribed rehabilitation exercise program, we saw significant improvements in physical fitness, body composition, and physical activity without any complication or biochemical deterioration among compensated HCC patients who had completed therapy.

AB  - To study the joint, in order to reduce the global approach is to provide an overview of the risk to injury the badminton. Leg and back injuries were mainly due to lack of strength or mobility while the hand and shoulder area were injured due to incorrect technique. This aspect contributes to the prevention of lower limb injury programs that should be addressed. Fatigue affects the way these tendons are less powerful and more unstable the way punching is done abruptly in the water, as well as jumps. Increased physical strength program to prevent training injuries. Badminton evaluation is the process of evaluating the performance of most players to improve their training skills and identify their strengths and weaknesses for them. Some traditional assessment methods were deficient in human resources, professional knowledge and objective methods. In addition, quality parameters and rating models for evaluating feather ball use are still under research. In this research, the main purpose of the Internet of Things is to design and create a new and effective system for badminton evaluation. The next generation cheating game training things architecture website is proposed. To confirm its effectiveness, a motion sensor meme-based Wireless Sensor Device (WSD) (Micro Electro Mechanical System) is used to identify the technical status of different badminton players and badminton strokes. Includes custom sensor nodes for system data collection, mobile applications, and processing units for cloud-based data.

AB  - For decades, the negative consequences on human health of mental stress have been known. In order to prevent these negative effects, high-level stresses should be detected early. Following the development of wearable devices, which may be part of our lives, researchers began to detect the extreme stresses of people with them every day. A main problem for environmental protection systems is automatic stress identification. The paper presents two studies with a low-cost sensor, a chest belt, aimed at stress detection with the following concepts and results. In order to assess the sensor reliability the cardiac rate and other characteristics of the belt is compared with those tested in the device validation check by gold standard instruments (n = 5). For more analysis with easy synchronisation and data cleaning algorithms (> 97%), we were able to pick strongly clustered, low average data segments with a significant chest data duration. Mental stress, especially among young people, is nowadays a major issue. The generation which was once thought most vulnerable is now under tremendous pressure. Stress growth today leads to many problems such as depression, suicide, heart attack, and stroke. Stress increase for this study, one week before the test and during Internet usage we quantify the mental tension of students. Our aim is to examine tension at different points in his life at colleges. The effect of pressure testing or stressing recruitments is often not noticed on the student. We examine how these variables impact a student's mind and how this tension is linked to the time spent on the internet.

AB  - Purpose A huge amount of diverse data is generated in the Internet of Things (IoT) because of heterogeneous devices like sensors, actuators, gateways and many more. Due to assorted nature of devices, interoperability remains a major challenge for IoT system developers. The purpose of this study is to use mapping techniques for converting relational database (RDB) to resource directory framework (RDF) for the development of ontology. Ontology helps in achieving semantic interoperability in application areas of IoT which results in shared/common understanding of the heterogeneous data generated by the diverse devices used in health-care domain. Design/methodology/approach To overcome the issue of semantic interoperability in healthcare domain, the authors developed an ontology for patients having cardio vascular diseases. Patients located at any place around the world can be diagnosed by Heart Experts located at another place by using this approach. This mechanism deals with the mapping of heterogeneous data into the RDF format in an integrated and interoperable manner. This approach is used to integrate the diverse data of heart patients needed for diagnosis with respect to cardio vascular diseases. This approach is also applicable in other fields where IoT is mostly used. Findings Experimental results showed that the RDF works better than the relational database for semantic interoperability in the IoT. This concept-based approach is better than key-based approach and reduces the computation time and storage of the data. Originality/value The proposed approach helps in overcoming the demerits of relational database like standardization, expressivity, provenance and supports SPARQL. Therefore, it helps to overcome the heterogeneity, thereby enabling the semantic interoperability in IoT.

AB  - The vital signs can vary significantly depending on the daily physical activities, which may not be due to defects of the organs. Under remote human health-monitoring applications, for reliable disease diagnosis, recorded biomedical signals such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a photoplethysmogram (PPG) must be indexed with physical activity information, as it is unknown to the physicians and also to the computer-aided diagnostic system. Since deep-learning (DL) networks were explored for various vital signs extraction and disease classification, we present an effective convolutional neural network (CNN)-based human activity recognition (HAR) method by exploring suitable hyperparameters. CNN-based methods are evaluated using the acceleration signals taken from the standard HAR benchmark database, University of California, Irvine (UCI) with accuracy (ACC), model size (in kB), and processing time (PT), and also implemented on the Raspberry Pi 4 (R-Pi-4) to study real-time feasibility. Evaluation results showed that higher HAR accuracy can be achieved with the activation function of the exponential linear unit (ELU) for the 2-layer CNN with a segment size of 2.5 s (ACC of 89.05% and PT of 0.142 ms), the 4-layer CNN with a segment size of 1 s (ACC of 91.66% and PT of 0.541 ms), and the 6-layer CNN with a segment size of 2 s (ACC of 91.18% and PT of 1.672 ms). Results demonstrated that the selection of an optimal number of layers and hyperparameters plays a major role in achieving higher accuracy with lower computational time on both personal computer central processing unit (PC-CPU) and R-Pi computing platforms, which were not addressed in past studies.

AB  - The early diagnosis of infectious diseases is critical because it can greatly increase recovery rates and prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19; however, in many areas with insufficient medical facilities, the timely detection of diseases is challenging. Conventional medical testing methods require specialized laboratory equipment and well-trained operators, limiting the applicability of these tests. Microfluidic point-of-care (POC) equipment can rapidly detect diseases at low cost. This technology could be used to detect diseases in underdeveloped areas to reduce the effects of disease and improve quality of life in these areas. This review details microfluidic POC equipment and its applications. First, the concept of microfluidic POC devices is discussed. We then describe applications of microfluidic POC devices for infectious diseases, cardiovascular diseases, tumors (cancer), and chronic diseases, and discuss the future incorporation of microfluidic POC devices into applications such as wearable devices and telemedicine. Finally, the review concludes by analyzing the present state of the microfluidic field, and suggestions are made. This review is intended to call attention to the status of disease treatment in underdeveloped areas and to encourage the researchers of microfluidics to develop standards for these devices.

AB  - The in situ diagnosis of cardiac activities with simultaneous therapeutic electrical stimulation of the heart is key to preventing cardiac arrhythmia. Here, we present an unconventional single-device platform that enables in situ monitoring even in a wet condition and control of beating heart motions without interferences to the recording signal. This platform consists of the active- matrix array of pressure-sensitive transistors for detecting cardiac beatings, biocompatible, low-impedance electrodes for cardiac stimulations, and an alginate-based hydrogel adhesive for attaching this platform conformally to the epicardium. In contrast to conventional electrophysiological sensing using electrodes, the pressure-sensitive transistors measured mechanophysiological characteristics by monitoring the spatiotemporal distributions of cardiac pressures during heart beating motions. In vivo tests show mechanophysiological readings having good correlation with electrocardiography and negligible interference with the electrical artifacts caused during cardiac stimulations. This platform can therapeutically synchronize the rhythm of abnormal heartbeats through efficient pacing of cardiac arrhythmia.

AB  - Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are deficit in communication, social skills, empathy, emotional responsiveness and have significant behavioral pattern. They have difficulty in understanding other feelings and their own emotions. This leads to the sudden emotional outburst and aggressive behavior in these children. Parents, caretakers and doctors find it very difficult to prevent such extreme behaviors. Learning the positive and negative valence leads in determining the early indications before the onset of emotional outbursts in children with ASD. The present study measures the psycho physiological electrocardiogram (ECG) signal from the typically developed (TD) children and children with ASD in the age group of 5-11 years. Personalized protocol was developed for every child with ASD to induce positive and negative valence and ECG data was collected using wearable Shimmer ECG device. The heart rate variability (HRV) and the QRS amplitude were derived from ECG signal using Pan-Tompkins algorithm and eleven features were extracted using DWT (db2, db4 and db8) mother wavelet. The significant features of ECG, HRV and QRS amplitude were classified using the K nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM) and ensemble classifier. Ensemble and KNN classifier achieved maximum accuracy of 81% and 76.2% for children with ASD and Ensemble and SVM classifiers obtained maximum accuracy of 87.4% and 83.8% for TD children using HRV data.

AB  - Ensuring that all the teeth surfaces are adequately covered during daily brushing can reduce the risk of several oral diseases. In this paper, we propose the mTeeth model to detect teeth surfaces being brushed with a manual toothbrush in the natural free-living environment using wrist-worn inertial sensors. To unambiguously label sensor data corresponding to different surfaces and capture all transitions that last only milliseconds, we present a lightweight method to detect the micro-event of brushing strokes that cleanly demarcates transitions among brushing surfaces. Using features extracted from brushing strokes, we propose a Bayesian Ensemble method that leverages the natural hierarchy among teeth surfaces and patterns of transition among them. For training and testing, we enrich a publicly-available wrist-worn inertial sensor dataset collected from the natural environment with time-synchronized precise labels of brushing surface timings and moments of transition. We annotate 10,230 instances of brushing on different surfaces from 114 episodes and evaluate the impact of wide between-person and within-person between-episode variability on machine learning model's performance for brushing surface detection.

AB  - The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) and sensing technologies has led to an increasing interest in time-series data analysis. In many domains, detecting patterns of IoT data and interpreting these patterns are challenging issues. There are several methods in time-series analysis that deal with issues such as volume and velocity of IoT data streams. However, analysing the content of the data streams and extracting insights from dynamic IoT data is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a pattern representation method which represents time-series frames as vectors by first applying Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA) and then applying Lagrangian Multipliers. This method allows representing continuous data as a series of patterns that can be used and processed by various higher-level methods. We introduce a new change point detection method which uses the constructed patterns in its analysis. We evaluate and compare our representation method with Blocks of Eigenvalues Algorithm (BEATS) and Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) methods to cluster various datasets. We have evaluated our algorithm using UCR time-series datasets and also a healthcare dataset. The evaluation results show significant improvements in analysing time-series data in our proposed method.

AB  - Prolonged exposure to mental stress reduces human work efficiency in daily life and may increase the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. However, identification of the true degree of stress in its initial stage can reduce the risk of life threatening diseases. In this paper, we proposed a multilevel stress detection system using ultra-short term recordings of a low cost wearable sensor. We designed an experimental paradigm based on Mental Arithmetic Tasks (MAT) to properly stimulate different levels of stress. During the experiment, Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals were recorded along with subjective feedback for validation of stress induction. The beat-to-beat interval series, estimated from sixty seconds long segments of PPG signals, were used to extract different features based on their reliability. In order to capture the temporal information in the ultra-short term segments of PPG, we introduced a new set of features which have the potential to quantify the temporal information at point-to-point level in the Poincare plot. We also used a Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) algorithm to mitigate the issues of irrelevancy and redundancy among features. We investigated two classifiers based on quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The results of the proposed method produced 94.33% accuracy with SVM for five-level identification of mental stress. Moreover, we validated the generalizability of the system by evaluating its performance on a dataset recorded with a different stressor (Stroop). In conclusion, we found that the proposed multilevel stress detection system in conjunction with new parameters of the Poincare plot has the potential to detect five different mental stress states using ultra-short term recordings of a low-cost PPG sensor.

AB  - Despite numerous research efforts, the precise mechanisms of concussion have yet to be fully uncovered. Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such as contact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the link between impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearable sensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutions operating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to share these data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid in the development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper puts forth two contributions: (1) a centralized, open-access platform for storing and sharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal Interagency Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and (2) a deep learning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true head impacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validated instrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces with FITBIR. We report 96% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model, improving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91% accuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate football head impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborative research tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creating a standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics.

AB  - In recent years, AI(Artificial Intelligence) has achieved great development in modern society. More and more modern technologies are applied in surveillance and monitoring. Healthcare monitoring is growing ubiquitous in modern wearable devices, such as a smart watch, electrocardiogram (ECG) necklace, smart band. Many sensors are attached to these smart devices to record and monitor physiological signals caused by activities, and then propagated those recorded electrical data to be further processed to give health diagnosis, disease prevention or making a distress call automatically. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder with a high occurrence in adult people and observed as an autonomous risk factor for circulatory problems such as ischemic heart attacks and stroke. Numerous traditional neural network based methods have been developed to detect OSA, where these methods however could not provide the intended result because they rely on shallow network. In this paper, we propose an effective OSA detection based on Convolutional neural network. Our method first extracts features from Apnea-Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using RR-intervals (time interval from one R-wave to the next R-wave in an ECG signal) and then CNN model having three convolution layers and three fully connected layers is trained with extracted features and applied for OSA detection. The first two convolution layers are followed by batch normalization and pooling layer, and softmax is connected to the last fully connected layer to give final decision. Experimental results on extracted feature of Apnea-ECG signal reveal that our model have better results in terms of performance measure sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It is expected that the related technology can be applied into smart sensors, especially wearable devices.

TI  - The Prediction of Atherosclerosis Index Based on Photoplethysmograph
T2  - SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING
LA  - English
AB  - Current atherosclerosis (AS) assessment devices have a disadvantage for users to carry around. In response to this shortcoming, we propose to collect the wrist photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal and create models to predict the indicators of atherosclerosis (cardiovascular age and right brachial and ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV)). This study uses the maximum correlation coefficient method for feature selection and establishes multiple models to predict cardiovascular age and the right baPWV. The study results show that the prediction of cardiovascular age using the backpropagation (BP) neural network model is the best. Its Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is 0.9501 (P < 0.05), and the model finds the best six physiological features as crest time (CT), crest time ratio (CTR), slop K, stiffness index (SI), reflection index (RI), and heart rate (HR). When predicting the right baPWV value on the right side, we propose a hybrid method MLR_BP, which has better experimental results than BP and MLR. The MLR_BP model improves the prediction accuracy, the predicted PCC value is 0.9204 (P < 0.05), and the model only needs two features, HR and cardiovascular age. This study further verified the results of related literature and proved the relationship between AS and related physiological parameters. The proposed method is applied to wearable devices and has an application value for diagnosing AS and preventing cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - BackgroundPhysical activity (PA) monitoring is applied in a growing number of studies within cancer research. However, no consensus exists on how many days PA should be monitored to obtain reliable estimates in the cancer population. The objective of the present study was to determine the minimum number of monitoring days required for reliable estimates of different PA intensities in cancer survivors when using a six-days protocol. Furthermore, reliability of monitoring days was assessed stratified on sex, age, cancer type, weight status, and educational level. MethodsData was obtained from two studies where PA was monitored for seven days using the SenseWear Armband Mini in a total of 984 cancer survivors diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. Participants with >= 22 hours monitor wear-time for six days were included in the reliability analysis (n = 736). The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Spearman Brown prophecy formula were used to assess the reliability of different number of monitoring days. ResultsFor time in light PA, two monitoring days resulted in reliable estimates (ICC >0.80). Participants with BMI >= 25, low-medium education, colorectal cancer, or age >= 60 years required one additional monitoring day. For moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA, three monitoring days yielded reliable estimates. Participants with BMI >= 25 or breast cancer required one additional monitoring day. Vigorous PA showed the largest within subject variations and reliable estimates were not obtained for the sample as a whole. However, reliable estimates were obtained for breast cancer survivors (4 days), females, BMI >= 30, and age <60 years (6 days). ConclusionShorter monitoring periods may provide reliable estimates of PA levels in cancer survivors when monitored continuously with a wearable device. This could potentially lower the participant burden and allow for less exclusion of participants not adhering to longer protocols.

AB  - Growing impact of poststroke upper extremity (UE) functional limitations entails newer dimensions in assessment methodologies. This has compelled researchers to think way beyond traditional stroke assessment scales during the out-patient rehabilitation phase. In concurrence with this, sensor-driven quantitative evaluation of poststroke UE functional limitations has become a fertile field of research. Here, we have emphasized an instrumented wearable for systematic monitoring of stroke patients with right-hemiparesis for evaluating their grasp abilities deploying intelligent algorithms. An instrumented glove housing 6 flex sensors, 3 force sensors, and a motion processing unit was developed to administer 19 activities of Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) while experimenting on 20 voluntarily participating subjects. After necessary signal conditioning, meaningful features were extracted, and subsequently the most appropriate ones were selected using the ReliefF algorithm. An optimally tuned support vector classifier was employed to classify patients with different degrees of disability and an accuracy of 92% was achieved supported by a high area under the receiver operating characteristic score. Furthermore, selected features could provide additional information that revealed the causes of grasp limitations. This would assist physicians in planning more effective poststroke rehabilitation strategies. Results of the one-way ANOVA test conducted on actual and predicted ARAT scores of the subjects indicated remarkable prospects of the proposed glove-based method in poststroke grasp ability assessment and rehabilitation.

AB  - Pen-based handwriting has become one of the major human-computer interaction methods. Traditional approaches either require writing on the specific supporting device like the touch screen, or limit the way of using the pen to pure rotation or translation. In this paper, we propose Handwriting-Assistant, to capture the free handwriting of ordinary pens on regular planes with mm-level accuracy. By attaching the inertial measurement unit (IMU) to the pen tail, we can infer the handwriting on the notebook, blackboard or other planes. Particularly, we build a generalized writing model to correlate the rotation and translation of IMU with the tip displacement comprehensively, thereby we can infer the tip trace accurately. Further, to display the effective handwriting during the continuous writing process, we leverage the principal component analysis (PCA) based method to detect the candidate writing plane, and then exploit the distance variation of each segment relative to the plane to distinguish on-plane strokes. Moreover, our solution can apply to other rigid bodies, enabling smart devices embedded with IMUs to act as handwriting tools. Experiment results show that our approach can capture the handwriting with high accuracy, e.g., the average tracking error is 1.84mm for letters with the size of about 2cmx1cm, and the average character recognition rate of recovered single letters achieves 98.2% accuracy of the ground-truth recorded by touch screen.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition characterized by impairment in a single cognitive domain or mild deficit in several cognitive domains. MCI patients are at increased risk of progression to dementia with almost 50% of MCI patients developing dementia within five years. Early detection can play an important role in early intervention, prevention, and appropriate treatments. In this study, we examined heart rate variability (HRV) as a novel physiological biomarker for identifying individuals at higher risk of MCI. We investigated if measuring HRV using non-invasive sensors might offer reliable, non-invasive techniques to distinguish MCI patients from healthy controls. Twenty-one MCI patients were recruited to examine this possibility. HRV was assessed using CorSense wearable device. HRV indices were analyzed and compared in rest between MCI and healthy controls. The significance of difference of numerical data between two groups was assessed using parametric unpaired t-test or non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test based on the fulfilment of unpaired t-test assumptions. Multiple linear regression models were performed to assess the association between individual HRV parameter with the cognitive status adjusting for gender and age. Time-domain parameters i.e., the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), and the root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats (RMSSD) were significantly lower in MCI patients compared with healthy controls. Prediction accuracy for the logistic regression using 10-fold cross-validation was 76.5%, Specificity was 0.8571, while sensitivity was 0.8095. Our study demonstrated that healthy participants have higher HRV indices compared to older adults with MCI using non-invasive biosensors technologies. Our results are of clinical importance in terms of showing the possibility that MCI of older people can be predicted using only HRV PPG-based data.

AB  - Objective. The primary purpose of this work is to analyze the ability of N-BEATS architecture for the problem of prediction and classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. To achieve this, performance comparison with various types of other SotA (state-of-the-art) recurrent neural network architectures commonly used for such problems is conducted. Approach. Four architectures (N-BEATS, LSTM, LSTM with peepholes, GRU) were tested for performance and dimension reduction problems for different number of leads (2, 3, 4, 6, 12), both in variants consisting of blended branches, allowing retaining accuracy while reducing the computational capacity needed. The analysis was performed on datasets and using metrics from Challenges in Cardiology (CinC) 2021 competition. Main results. Best results were achieved for LSTM with peepholes, then LSTM, GRU and the worst for N-BEATS (challenge metrics respectively: 0.42, 0.40, 0.39, 0.35; for times: 0.0395 s, 0.0036 s, 0.0027 s, 0.0002 s). Commonly used LSTM outperforms N-BEATS in terms of multi-label classification, data set resilience, and obtained challenge metrics. Still, N-BEATS can obtain acceptable results for 2 lead classification (metric of 0.35 for N-BEATS and 0.38 for other networks) and outperforms other solutions in terms of complexity and speed. Significance. This paper features a novel approach of using the N-BEATS, which was previously used only for forecasting, to classify ECG signals with success. While N-BEATS multi-label classification capacity is lower than LSTM, its speed obtaining results with a reduced number of leads (faster by one to two degrees of magnitude) allows for arrhythmias detection and classification while using off-the-shelf wearable devices (Holter monitors, sport bands, etc).

AB  - The wearable industry is growing and diverse. However, despite the variety in device producers and served purposes, many wearables include biosensors that can measure health parameters, such as heart rate. This makes them potentially useful or even disruptive for healthcare; particularly, for its remote delivery mode that is referred to as telehealth. Wearables and consumer technologies can bring changes to the current value network of telehealth industry by creating new business roles and attracting new stakeholders. However, traditionally regulated telehealth industry may be reluctant to accept unregulated non-medical devices. Furthermore, apart from the potential impact of wearables, the future of the industry is affected by other factors, which need to be understood. This article analyzes a potential evolution of the telehealth value network. For that, we first identified the current trends in the evolution of telehealth technologies and products based on the quantitative analysis and review of three different types of literature scientific publications, patents, and press releases. Furthermore, we discussed the actors that can drive the future telehealth industry by taking a key role in its value network. The study indicates that technologies and products brought by consumer companies will be used in telehealth for the self-management of chronic diseases and wellness. To facilitate the interaction of the previously separated unregulated consumer and regulated medical domains of telehealth, a new health data aggregation role may emerge and take a central position in the value network. While several candidates for this role can be identified, currently, none of them has the full required expertise.

AB  - Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.

TI  - AI-Driven sleep staging from actigraphy and heart rate
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Sleep is an important indicator of a person's health, and its accurate and cost-effective quantification is of great value in healthcare. The gold standard for sleep assessment and the clinical diagnosis of sleep disorders is polysomnography (PSG). However, PSG requires an overnight clinic visit and trained technicians to score the obtained multimodality data. Wrist-worn consumer devices, such as smartwatches, are a promising alternative to PSG because of their small form factor, continuous monitoring capability, and popularity. Unlike PSG, however, wearables-derived data are noisier and far less information-rich because of the fewer number of modalities and less accurate measurements due to their small form factor. Given these challenges, most consumer devices perform two-stage (i.e., sleep-wake) classification, which is inadequate for deep insights into a person's sleep health. The challenging multi-class (three, four, or five-class) staging of sleep using data from wrist-worn wearables remains unresolved. The difference in the data quality between consumer-grade wearables and lab-grade clinical equipment is the motivation behind this study. In this paper, we present an artificial intelligence (AI) technique termed sequence-to-sequence LSTM for automated mobile sleep staging (SLAMSS), which can perform three-class (wake, NREM, REM) and four-class (wake, light, deep, REM) sleep classification from activity (i.e., wrist-accelerometry-derived locomotion) and two coarse heart rate measures-both of which can be reliably obtained from a consumer-grade wrist-wearable device. Our method relies on raw time-series datasets and obviates the need for manual feature selection. We validated our model using actigraphy and coarse heart rate data from two independent study populations: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 808) cohort and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS; N = 817) cohort. SLAMSS achieves an overall accuracy of 79%, weighted F1 score of 0.80, 77% sensitivity, and 89% specificity for three-class sleep staging and an overall accuracy of 70-72%, weighted F1 score of 0.72-0.73, 64-66% sensitivity, and 89-90% specificity for four-class sleep staging in the MESA cohort. It yielded an overall accuracy of 77%, weighted F1 score of 0.77, 74% sensitivity, and 88% specificity for three-class sleep staging and an overall accuracy of 68-69%, weighted F1 score of 0.68-0.69, 60-63% sensitivity, and 88-89% specificity for four-class sleep staging in the MrOS cohort. These results were achieved with feature-poor inputs with a low temporal resolution. In addition, we extended our three-class staging model to an unrelated Apple Watch dataset. Importantly, SLAMSS predicts the duration of each sleep stage with high accuracy. This is especially significant for four-class sleep staging, where deep sleep is severely underrepresented. We show that, by appropriately choosing the loss function to address the inherent class imbalance, our method can accurately estimate deep sleep time (SLAMSS/MESA: 0.61 +/- 0.69 hours, PSG/MESA ground truth: 0.60 +/- 0.60 hours; SLAMSS/MrOS: 0.53 +/- 0.66 hours, PSG/MrOS ground truth: 0.55 +/- 0.57 hours;). Deep sleep quality and quantity are vital metrics and early indicators for a number of diseases. Our method, which enables accurate deep sleep estimation from wearables-derived data, is therefore promising for a variety of clinical applications requiring long-term deep sleep monitoring.

AB  - In this paper we propose a hybrid decision-making process for medical diagnosis. The hypothesis tested is that a deep learning system can provide real-time monitoring of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), a prevalent heart arrhythmia, and a human cardiologist will then verify the results and reach a diagnosis. The verification step adds the necessary checks and balances to increase the safety of the computer-based diagnostic process.
   In order to test hybrid-decision making, we created a prototype AF monitoring service. The service is based on Heart Rate (HR) sensors for signal acquisition as well as Internet of Things (IoT) technology for data communication and storage. These technologies enable transfer of HR data from patient to central cloud server. A deep learning system is used to analyze the data, which is then presented to a cardiologist when a dangerous condition is detected. This human specialist then works to verify the deep learning results based on the HR data and additional knowledge obtained through patient records or by personal interaction with the patient.
   A prerequisite for safety in any computer expert system is the clarity of purpose for the decision-making process. Health-care providers are considered customers who register patients with the AF monitoring service. The service delivers real-time diagnostic support by providing timely alarm messages and HR analysis. The safety critical decision then lies with the human practitioner.

AB  - Background and objective: Beat-to-beat alteration in ventricles repolarization reflected by alternans of amplitude and/or shape of ECG 3-T,T segment (TWA) is known as phenomena related with risk of severe arrhythmias leading to sudden cardiac death. Technical difficulties have caused limited its usage in clinical diagnostics. Possibilities to register and analyze multimodal signals reflecting heart activity inspired search for new technical solutions. First objective of this study was to test whether thoracic impedance signal and beat-to-beat heart rate reflect repolarization altemans detected as TWA. The second objective was revelation of multimodal signal features more comprehensively representing the phenomena and increasing its prognostic usefulness.
   Materials and methods: ECG, and thoracic impedance signal recordings made during 24 h follow-up of the patients hospitalized in acute phase of myocardial infarction were used for investigation. Signal morphology variations reflecting estimates were obtained by the principal component analysis-based method. Clinical outcomes of patients (survival and/ or rehospitalization in 6 and 12 months) were compared to repolarization altemans and heart rate variability estimates.
   Results: Repolarization altemans detected as TWA was also reflected in estimates of thoracic impedance signal shape and variation in beat-to-beat heart rate. All these parameters showed correlation with clinical outcomes of patients. The strongest significant correlation showed magnitude of alternans in estimates of thoracic impedance signal shape.
   Conclusions: The features of ECG, thoracic impedance signal and beat-to-beat variability of heart rate, give comprehensive estimates of repolarization alternans, which correlate, with clinical outcomes of the patients and we recommend using them to improve diagnostic reliability.

AB  - Background: On-body wearable sensors have been used to predict adverse outcomes such as hospitalizations or fall, thereby enabling clinicians to develop better intervention guidelines and personalized models of care to prevent harmful outcomes. In our previous work, we introduced a generic remote patient monitoring framework (Sensing At-Risk Population) that draws on the classification of human movements using a 3-axial accelerometer and the extraction of indoor localization using Bluetooth low energy beacons, in concert. Using the same framework, this paper addresses the longitudinal analyses of a group of patients in a skilled nursing facility. We try to investigate if the metrics derived from a remote patient monitoring system comprised of physical activity and indoor localization sensors, as well as their association with therapist assessments, provide additional insight into the recovery process of patients receiving rehabilitation.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to observe longitudinal changes of sensor-based physical activity and indoor localization features of patients receiving rehabilitation at a skilled nursing facility and (2) to investigate if the sensor-based longitudinal changes can complement patients' changes captured by therapist assessments over the course of rehabilitation in the skilled nursing facility.
   Methods: From June 2016 to November 2017, patients were recruited after admission to a subacute rehabilitation center in Los Angeles, CA. Longitudinal cohort study of patients at a skilled nursing facility was followed over the course of 21 days. At the time of discharge from the skilled nursing facility, the patients were either readmitted to the hospital for continued care or discharged to a community setting. A longitudinal study of the physical therapy, occupational therapy, and sensor-based data assessments was performed. A generalized linear mixed model was used to find associations between functional measures with sensor-based features. Occupational therapy and physical therapy assessments were performed at the time of admission and once a week during the skilled nursing facility admission.
   Results: Of the 110 individuals in the analytic sample with mean age of 79.4 (SD 5.9) years, 79 (72%) were female and 31 (28%) were male participants. The energy intensity of an individual while in the therapy area was positively associated with transfer activities (beta=.22; SE 0.08; P=.02). Sitting energy intensity showed positive association with transfer activities (beta=.16; SE 0.07; P=.02). Lying down energy intensity was negatively associated with hygiene activities (beta=-.27; SE 0.14; P=.04). The interaction of sitting energy intensity with time (beta=-.13; SE 0.06; P=.04) was associated with toileting activities.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that a combination of indoor localization and physical activity tracking produces a series of features, a subset of which can provide crucial information to the story line of daily and longitudinal activity patterns of patients receiving rehabilitation at a skilled nursing facility. The findings suggest that detecting physical activity changes within locations may offer some insight into better characterizing patients' progress or decline.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a machine-based classification technique using the scattering parameters obtained using a wearable wideband textile antenna to diagnose breast tumors. The breast phantom is formed following the dielectric properties of the human breast tissues and characterized to ensure the resemblance with a actual tissue model for the range of frequencies from 3 to 10 GHz. A biocompatible textile antenna is fabricated and embedded on an artificial breast phantom model to capture the variation of the reflection coefficient S-11 and the transmission coefficient S-21 for frequencies 3-10 GHz for different locations and sizes of tumors within the phantom model. Support vector machine is used to classify the healthy tissues from the malignant tumors based on the variation of the scattering parameters owing to the variation of the dielectric characteristics of the breast phantom model. The proposed method offers 84% and 89% accuracy while using S-11 and S-21 parameters alone for the analysis. However, the results further improve up to 93% as a combination of S-11 and S-21 signals is considered.

AB  - Wearable sensing has enabled physiological monitoring in everyday life. Clinically, cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring commonly requires separate devices. However, for feasibility in wearable systems, they are integrated into a single device. Since seismocardiography (SCG) records the motion of the chest wall, it has the potential to monitor both vital signs. The primary application of SCG is cardiovascular monitoring. As a result, its ability to detect respiration has been less defined. This study characterizes how SCG is affected by respiration and consequently, how respiratory metrics can be derived from these effects. The sternal motion of 40 subjects was recorded using an inertial measurement unit with a spirometer for reference. Three scenarios were examined with the subject at rest, holding their breath at peak inhalation, and holding their breath when exhaled. Three main aspects of respiratory modulation were explored: amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, and baseline wandering. The SCG amplitude was observed to be dependent on respiratory volume whereas baseline and frequency modulation were dependent on inhalation phase. All three effects were employed separately in the calculation of respiratory rate. Estimations from baseline wandering, amplitude modulation, and heart rate modulation produced r-squared values of 0.71, 0.44, and 0.66, respectively. The accuracy of tidal volume measurement was limited by a high inter-subject variability. Estimation of the respiratory waveform produced an average r-squared of 0.76 using multivariate linear regression. This demonstrates the potential of SCG as a tool for respiratory monitoring within an integrated, non-invasive cardiorespiratory monitoring system from a single point of contact.

AB  - Objectives Dietary assessment methods not relying on self-report are needed. The Automatic Ingestion Monitor 2 (AIM-2) combines a wearable camera that captures food images with sensors that detect food intake. We compared energy intake (EI) estimates of meals derived from AIM-2 chewing sensor signals, AIM-2 images, and an internet-based diet diary, with researcher conducted weighed food records (WFR) as the gold standard. Subjects/Methods Thirty adults wore the AIM-2 for meals self-selected from a university food court on one day in mixed laboratory and free-living conditions. Daily EI was determined from a sensor regression model, manual image analysis, and a diet diary and compared with that from WFR. A posteriori analysis identified sources of error for image analysis and WFR differences. Results Sensor-derived EI from regression modeling (R-2 = 0.331) showed the closest agreement with EI from WFR, followed by diet diary estimates. EI from image analysis differed significantly from that by WFR. Bland-Altman analysis showed wide limits of agreement for all three test methods with WFR, with the sensor method overestimating at lower and underestimating at higher EI. Nutritionist error in portion size estimation and irreconcilable differences in portion size between food and nutrient databases used for WFR and image analyses were the greatest contributors to image analysis and WFR differences (44.4% and 44.8% of WFR EI, respectively). Conclusions Estimation of daily EI from meals using sensor-derived features offers a promising alternative to overcome limitations of self-report. Image analysis may benefit from computerized analytical procedures to reduce identified sources of error.

AB  - Stroke-related locomotor impairments are often associated with abnormal timing and intensity of recruitment of the affected and non-affected lower limb muscles. Restoring the proper lower limbs muscles activation is a key factor to facilitate recovery of gait capacity and performance, and to reduce maladaptive plasticity. Ekso is a wearable powered exoskeleton robot able to support over-ground gait training. The user controls the exoskeleton by triggering each single step during the gait cycle. The fine-tuning of the exoskeleton control system is crucial-it is set according to the residual functional abilities of the patient, and it needs to ensure lower limbs powered gait to be the most physiological as possible. This work focuses on the definition of an automatic calibration procedure able to detect the best Ekso setting for each patient. EMG activity has been recorded from Tibialis Anterior, Soleus, Rectus Femoris, and Semitendinosus muscles in a group of 7 healthy controls and 13 neurological patients. EMG signals have been processed so to obtain muscles activation patterns. The mean muscular activation pattern derived from the controls cohort has been set as reference. The developed automatic calibration procedure requires the patient to perform overground walking trials supported by the exoskeleton while changing parameters setting. The Gait Metric index is calculated for each trial, where the closer the performance is to the normative muscular activation pattern, in terms of both relative amplitude and timing, the higher the Gait Metric index is. The trial with the best Gait Metric index corresponds to the best parameters set. It has to be noted that the automatic computational calibration procedure is based on the same number of overground walking trials, and the same experimental set-up as in the current manual calibration procedure. The proposed approach allows supporting the rehabilitation team in the setting procedure. It has been demonstrated to be robust, and to be in agreement with the current gold standard (i.e., manual calibration performed by an expert engineer). The use of a graphical user interface is a promising tool for the effective use of an automatic procedure in a clinical context.

AB  - Background: In upper-extremity stroke rehabilitation applications, the potential use of Force Myography (FMG) for detecting grasping is especially relevant, as the presence of grasping may be indicative of functional activity, which is a key goal of rehabilitation. To date, most FMG research has focused on the classification of the raw FMG signal (i.e. instantaneous FMG samples) in order to determine the state of the hand. However, given the temporal nature of force generation during grasping, the use of temporal feature extraction techniques may yield increased accuracy. In this study, the effectiveness of classifying temporal features of the FMG signal for the two-class grasp detection problem of "grasp" versus "no grasp" (i.e. no object in hand) was evaluated with ten healthy participants. The experimental protocol comprised grasp and move tasks, requiring the use of six different grasp types frequently used in daily living, in conjunction with arm and hand movements. Data corresponding to arm and hand movements without grasping were also included to evaluate robustness to false positives. The temporal features evaluated were mean absolute value (MAV), root mean squared (RMS), linear fit (LF), parabolic fit (PF), and autoregressive model (AR). Off-line classification performance of the five temporal features, with a 0.5 s extraction window, were determined and compared to that of the raw FMG signal using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC).
   Results: The raw FMG signal yielded AUC of 0.819 +/- 0.098. LF and PF resulted in the greatest increases in classification performance, and provided statistically significant increases in performance. The largest increase obtained was with PF, yielding AUC of 0.869 +/- 0.061, corresponding to a 6.1% relative increase over the raw FMG signal. Despite the additional fitting term provided by PF, classification performance did not significantly improve with PF when compared to LF.
   Conclusions: The results obtained indicate that temporal feature extraction techniques that derive models of the data within the window may yield modest improvements in FMG based grasp detection performance. In future studies, the use of modelbased temporal features should be evaluated with FMG data from individuals with stroke, who might ultimately benefit from this technology.

AB  - Purpose of the review Commercial wearable biosensors are commonly used among athletes and highly active individuals, although their value in sports cardiology is not well established. In this review, we discuss the evidence for the current applications of wearables and provide our outlook for promising future directions of this emerging field.
   Recent findings The integration of routine assessment of physiological parameters, activity data, and features such as electrocardiogram recording has generated excitement over a role for wearables to help diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease. Presently, however, there are significant challenges limiting their routine clinical use. While studies suggest that wearable-derived data may help guide training, evidence for the use of wearables in guiding exercise regimens for individuals with cardiovascular disease is lacking. Further, there is a paucity of data to demonstrate its efficacy in detecting exercise-related arrhythmias or conditions associated with sudden cardiac death. Nevertheless, future technological developments may lead to a greater potential for wearables to aid in sports cardiology practice.
   Summary The ability to collect vast amounts of physiological information can help athletes personalize training regimens. However, interpretation of these data and separating the signal from the noise are paramount, especially when used in a clinical setting. While there are currently no standardized approaches for the use of wearable-derived data in sports cardiology, we outline three domains in which they could guide the care of athletes in the future: (1) optimizing athletic performance (2) guiding exercise in athletes with known cardiovascular disease, and (3) screening for cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Rationale: To date, EEG is the only quantifiable measure of the neural changes that define sleep. Although it is used widely for clinical testing, scalp-electrode EEG is costly and is poorly tolerated by sleeping patients.
   Objectives: This was a pilot study to assess the agreement between EEG recordings obtained from a new ear-EEG sensor and those obtained simultaneously from standard scalp electrodes.
   Methods: Participants were four healthy men, 25 to 36 years of age. During naps, EEG tracings were recorded simultaneously from the ear sensor and from standard scalp electrodes. A clinical expert, blinded to the data collection, analyzed 30-second epochs of recordings from both devices, using standardized criteria. The agreement between scalp-and ear-recordings was assessed.
   Measurements and Main Results: We scored 360 epochs (scalp-EEG and ear-EEG), of which 254 (70.6%) were scored as nonREM sleep using scalp-EEG. The ear-EEG sensor had a sensitivity of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82-0.92) and a specificity of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70-0.84) in detecting N2/N3 sleep. The kappa coefficient between the scalp-and the ear-EEG was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.58-0.73). As a sleep monitor (all non-REM sleep stages vs. wake), the in-ear sensor had a sensitivity of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.87-0.94) and a specificity of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.56-0.75). The kappa coefficient was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.50-0.69).
   Conclusions: Substantial agreement was observed between recordings derived from a new ear-EEG sensor and conventional scalp electrodes on four healthy volunteers during daytime naps.

AB  - Given the significant amount of time people spend in vehicles, health issues under driving condition have become a major concern. Such issues may vary from fatigue, asthma, stroke, to even heart attack, yet they can be adequately indicated by vital signs and abnormal activities. Therefore, in-vehicle vital sign monitoring can help us predict and hence prevent these issues. Whereas existing sensor-based (including camera) methods could be used to detect these indicators, privacy concern and system complexity both call for a convenient yet effective and robust alternative. This paper aims to develop V(2)iFi, an intelligent system performing monitoring tasks using a COTS impulse radio mounted on the windshield. V(2)iFi is capable of reliably detecting driver's vital signs under driving condition and with the presence of passengers, thus allowing for potentially inferring corresponding health issues. Compared with prior work based on Wi-Fi CSI, V(2)iFi is able to distinguish reflected signals from multiple users, and hence provide finer-grained measurements under more realistic settings. We evaluate V(2)iFi both in lab environments and during real-life road tests; the results demonstrate that respiratory rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability can all be estimated accurately. Based on these estimation results, we further discuss how machine learning models can be applied on top of V(2)iFi so as to improve both physiological and psychological wellbeing in driving environments.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to find an effective and simple method by which outpatient hemodialysis can be performed using diffusion and ultrafiltration methods with different procedures on a model. Methods: A solution containing high-level urea and creatinine similar to the blood values of patients with chronic renal failure was used, with the expectation of clearing it as in hemodialysis using a model with the designed system. The product values at the beginning and end of the process were determined, and the cleaning rates were calculated. Results: The clearance rates obtained in the serum were 79.2% for urea and 93.7% for creatinine. Greater than 65% clearance rates were detected in all products except calcium and magnesium. Statistical significance was found in all products (P < 0.05) except magnesium (P = 0.065). Conclusions: Using this method, we achieved a clearance rate greater than the desired clearance rates (65%) in hemodialysis.

AB  - Interfacing with the human body, wearable and implantable bioelectronics are a compelling platform technology for healthcare monitoring and medical therapeutics. However, clinical adoption of these devices is largely shadowed by their weakness in humidity resistance, stretchability, durability, and biocompatibility. In this work, we report a self-powered waterproof biomechanical sensor with stretchability up to 440% using the giant magnetoelastic effect in a soft polymer system. By manipulating the magnetic dipole alignment, the sensor achieved a particularly broad sensing range from 33 Pa to 2000 kPa, with a response time of similar to 3 ms. To validate the excellent performance of the magnetoelastic sensor in biomonitoring, both ex vivo porcine heart testing and in vivo rat model testing were performed for cardiovascular monitoring and heart disease diagnosis. With the obtained sensing data, we have successfully detected ventricular arrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation in the Sprague-Dawley rat model. Holding a collection of compelling features, including minimal hysteresis, ultrawide sensing range, waterproofness, and biocompatibility, the magnetoelastic sensor represents a unique platform technology for self-powered biomonitoring in both wearable and implantable manners.

AB  - Introduction: Current guidelines recommend wearable activity trackers to detect insufficient physical activity (PA) and help increase PA to prevent or ameliorate cardiovascular disease. However, there is a paucity of data regarding how objectively measured PA trajectories, patterns, and sedentary time, are associated with mortality and recurrent events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with established coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, it remains unclear if early PA and sedentary time after PCI are associated with such outcomes. Therefore, in the present study ( Identifier: NCT04663373), we aim to establish the associations of objectively measured PA with major adverse cardiac events and mortality at one-year follow-up. Methods and analysis: In this single-centre observational study, patients with CAD will be prospectively recruited immediately after PCI. All the information from the clinical history, baseline characteristics, and outcomes during follow-up will be obtained from the CARDIOBASE registry. Accelerometer data will be collected for 18 days following hospital discharge and 14 days at one-year follow-up. PA trajectories will be identified by group-based trajectory modeling. Major adverse cardiac events and mortality will be prospectively monitored up to 1 year after PCI. All data will be collected using Research Electronic Data Capture.

AB  - Background: Identification of individual gait events is essential for clinical gait analysis, because it can be used for diagnostic purposes or tracking disease progression in neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Previous research has shown that gait events can be detected from a shank-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU), however detection performance was often evaluated only from straight-line walking. For use in daily life, the detection performance needs to be evaluated in curved walking and turning as well as in single-task and dual-task conditions.
   Methods: Participants (older adults, people with Parkinson's disease, or people who had suffered from a stroke) performed three different walking trials: (1) straight-line walking, (2) slalom walking, (3) Stroop-and-walk trial. An optical motion capture system was used a reference system. Markers were attached to the heel and toe regions of the shoe, and participants wore IMUs on the lateral sides of both shanks. The angular velocity of the shank IMUs was used to detect instances of initial foot contact (IC) and final foot contact (FC), which were compared to reference values obtained from the marker trajectories.
   Results: The detection method showed high recall, precision and F1 scores in different populations for both initial contacts and final contacts during straight-line walking IC: recall = 100%, precision = 100%, F1 score = 100%; FC: recall = 100%, precision = 100%, F1 score = 100%), slalom walking (IC: recall = 100%, precision >= 99%, F1 score = 100%; FC: recall = 100%, precision >= 99%, F1 score =100%), and turning (IC: recall >= 85%, precision >= 95%, F1 score >= 91%; FC: recall >= 84%, precision >= 95%, F1 score >= 89%).
   Conclusions: Shank-mounted IMUs can be used to detect gait events during straight-line walking, slalom walking and turning. However, more false events were observed during turning and more events were missed during turning. For use in daily life we recommend identifying turning before extracting temporal gait parameters from identified gait events.

AB  - Beam pumping units are widely used in the oil production industry, but the energy efficiency of this artificial lift machinery is generally low, especially for the low-production well and high-production well in the later stage. There are a number of ways for energy savings in pumping units, with the periodic adjustment of stroke speed and rectification of balance deviation being two important methods. In the paper, an energy saving system for a beam pumping unit (ESS-BPU) based on the Internet of Things (IoT) was proposed. A total of four types of sensors, including load sensor, angle sensor, voltage sensor, and current sensor, were used to detect the operating conditions of the pumping unit. Data from these sensors was fed into a controller installed in an oilfield to adjust the stroke speed automatically and estimate the degree of balance in real-time. Additionally, remote supervision could be fulfilled using a browser on a computer or smartphone. Furthermore, the data from a practical application was recorded and analyzed, and it can be seen that ESS-BPU is helpful in reducing energy loss caused by unnecessarily high stroke speed and a poor degree of balance.

AB  - Background In many cases, the cause of exercise-induced cardiopulmonary arrest in young persons is thought to be fatal arrhythmia, and one of the causes is ischaemic heart disease. Left main coronary artery atresia (LMCAA) is an extremely rare disease in which there is a congenital defect of the left main coronary artery, causing heart failure and exercise-induced angina attacks at a young age. Thus, it is disease that should be differentiated when examining young persons with chest pain.
   Case summary A 16-year-old boy experienced sudden cardiopulmonary arrest during soccer practice, was brought to our hospital for emergency treatment after return of spontaneous circulation. Elective coronary angiography revealed findings indicating an osmium defect in the left coronary artery (LCA) and blood flow via collateral circulation from the right coronary artery. Contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography showed a defect in the LCA ostium and LMCAA was diagnosed in the patient. After coronary artery bypass grafting was performed, but the patient was discharged in an ambulatory state with a wearable cardiac defibrillator. Postoperative course has been favourable.
   Discussion Left main coronary artery atresia is an extremely rare disease in which there is a congenital defect of the left main trunk of the coronary artery and should be differentiated when encountering cases of heart failure or exercise-induced angina/arrhythmia attacks in young persons who are not at risk for atherosclerosis. Exercise electrocardiogram may show a false negative result, and therefore coronary CT is useful for diagnosis.

AB  - Objective: Remote monitoring of physical activity using body-worn sensors provides an objective alternative to current functional assessment tools. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of classifying categories of activities of daily living from the functional arm activity behavioral observation system (FAABOS) using muscle activation and motion data. Methods: Ten nondisabled, healthy adults were fitted with a Myo armband on the upper forearm. This multimodal commercial sensor device features surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors, an accelerometer, and a rate gyroscope. Participants performed 17 different activities of daily living, which belonged to one of four functional groups according to the FAABOS. Signal magnitude area (SMA) and mean values were extracted from the acceleration and angular rate of change data; root mean square (RMS) was computed for the sEMG data. A k-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm was then applied to predict the FAABOS task category using these raw data as inputs. Results: Mean acceleration, SMA of acceleration, mean angular rate of change, and RMS of sEMG were significantly different across the four FAABOS categories (p < 0.001 in all cases). A classifier using mean acceleration, mean angular rate of change, and sEMG data was able to predict task category with 89.2% accuracy. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility of using a combination of sEMG and motion data to noninvasively classify types of activities of daily living. Significance: This approach may be useful for quantifying daily activity performance in ambient settings as a more ecologically valid measure of function in healthy and disease-affected individuals.

AB  - Although often a life-saving therapeutic maneuver, there is minimal data available that details the effects of intraoperative packed red blood cell transfusion (IOT) after microvascular free tissue transfer. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried to identify all patients who underwent microvascular free tissue transfer between 2006 and 2010. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine the association between intraoperative transfusion and outcomes. Upon bivariate and multivariate analyses, IOT was significantly associated with higher rates of overall complications (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-3.63), medical complications (OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.75-6.42), postoperative transfusion (OR, 6.02; 95% CI, 2.02-17.97), and reoperation (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.24-4.04). IOT was not associated with either surgical complications or free flap loss. IOT significantly increases risk for adverse overall and medical complications. However, IOT was not associated with surgical complications or free flap loss. Transfusion practices in the operating room should be reevaluated to improve overall outcomes.

AB  - Wearable medical devices with sensor continuously generate enormous data which is often called as big data mixed with structured and unstructured data. Due to the complexity of the data, it is difficult to process and analyze the big data for finding valuable information that can be useful in decision-making. On the other hand, data security is a key requirement in healthcare big data system. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new architecture for the implementation of IoT to store and process scalable sensor data (big data) for health care applications. The Proposed architecture consists of two main sub architectures, namely, Meta Fog-Redirection (MF-R) and Grouping and Choosing (GC) architecture. MF-R architecture uses big data technologies such as Apache Pig and Apache HBase for collection and storage of the sensor data (big data) generated from different sensor devices. The proposed GC architecture is used for securing integration of fog computing with cloud computing. This architecture also uses key management service and data categorization function (Sensitive, Critical and Normal) for providing security services. The framework also uses MapReduce based prediction model to predict the heart diseases.

AB  - Prediabetes is a metabolic condition before the occurrence of diabetes. The diagnosis of prediabetes can slow down or eliminate the growing cases of diabetes around the world. This paper presents a novel approach to identifying some vital physiological features for prediabetes prediction to stem the growing trend of type-2 diabetes. A standard OGTT experiment was conducted using BIOPAC 150MP, g-SAHARA and Mindray physiological device to capture continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm and electroencephalogram (EEG) of 40 human subjects while measuring blood glucose value at a regular interval. Features from the captured physiological signals were analyzed using an integrated space-time principal component analysis, independent component analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selector operator, and piecewise aggregate approximation techniques. The results from feature analysis show that certain features, namely HRV, QT, and ST from ECG; alpha, beta, and theta from the right parental hemisphere, along with alpha and delta from the left occipital hemisphere from EEG show significant correlation with change in the blood glucose. Furthermore, a weight-based multimodel was proposed by combining five (5) classification methods. The selected ECG and EEG features were applied for training the proposed multi-model classification, which is used to predict prediabetes. The evaluation of the multi-model performance produced accuracy, precision, and F1-measure of 92.0%, 88.8%, and 82.7% respectively, which is higher than the individual methods. The experimental results show that the coupling of multi-model electrophysiological data acquired with wearable multi-sensor devices can be utilized to diagnose diabetes early. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Time series data collected from sensors can be analyzed to monitor changes in physical activity as an individual makes a substantial lifestyle change, such as recovering from an injury or illness. In an inpatient rehabilitation setting, approaches to detect and explain changes in longitudinal physical activity data collected from wearable sensors can provide value as a monitoring, research, and motivating tool. We adapt and expand our Physical Activity Change Detection (PACD) approach to analyze changes in patient activity in such a setting. We use Fitbit Charge Heart Rate devices with two separate populations to continuously record data to evaluate PACD, nine participants in a hospitalized inpatient rehabilitation group and eight in a healthy control group. We apply PACD to minute-by-minute Fitbit data to quantify changes within and between the groups. The inpatient rehabilitation group exhibited greater variability in change throughout inpatient rehabilitation for both step count and heart rate, with the greatest change occurring at the end of the inpatient hospital stay, which exceeded day-to-day changes of the control group. Our additions to PACD support effective change analysis of wearable sensor data collected in an inpatient rehabilitation setting and provide insight to patients, clinicians, and researchers.

AB  - The last decade has seen tremendous improvements in technologies for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, in particular the so-called artificial pancreas (AP), a wearable closed-loop device modulating insulin injection based on glucose sensor readings. Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the "UVA/Padova T1D Simulator," a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems.

AB  - Wearable home-monitoring devices acquiring various biosignals such as the electrocardiogram, photo-plethysmogram, electromyogram, respirational activity and movements have become popular in many fields of research, medical diagnostics and commercial applications. Especially ambulatory settings introduce still unsolved challenges to the development of sensor hardware and smart signal processing approaches. This work gives a detailed insight into a novel wireless body sensor network and addresses critical aspects such as signal quality, synchronicity among multiple devices as well as the system's overall capabilities and limitations in cardiovascular monitoring. An early sign of typical cardiovascular diseases is often shown by disturbed autonomic regulations such as orthostatic intolerance. In that context, blood pressure measurements play an important role to observe abnormalities like hypo- or hypertensions. Non-invasive and unobtrusive blood pressure monitoring still poses a significant challenge, promoting alternative approaches including pulse wave velocity considerations. In the scope of this work, the presented hardware is applied to demonstrate the continuous extraction of multi modal parameters like pulse arrival time within a preliminary clinical study. A Schellong test to diagnose orthostatic hypotension which is typically based on blood pressure cuff measurements has been conducted, serving as an application that might significantly benefit from novel multi-modal measurement principles. It is further shown that the system's synchronicity is as precise as 30 mu s and that the integrated analog preprocessing circuits and additional accelerometer data provide significant advantages in ambulatory measurement environments.

AB  - Polyaniline (PANI) films are promising candidates for electronic nose-based IoT applications, but device performances are influenced by fabrication parameters and ambient conditions. Affinities of different PANI composites to analytes for gas sensing applications remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the material properties in detail for two different dopant systems: F4TCNQ and carbon black. Using a reproducibility-driven approach, we investigate different dopant concentrations in regard to their sensitivity and specificity towards five relevant markers for breath cancer diagnosis. We benchmark the system using ammonia measurements and evaluate limits of detection. Furthermore, we provide statistical analysis on reproducibility and pave the way towards machine learning discrimination via principal component analysis. The influence of relative humidity on sensor hysteresis is also investigated. We find that F4TCNQ-doped PANI films show improved reproducibility compared to carbon black-doped films. We establish and quantify a tradeoff between sensitivity, reproducibility, and environmental stability by the choice of dopant and concentrations ratios.

AB  - Hand dysfunction caused by hand injuries, strokes, or other neurological degenerative diseases such as cervical spondylosis is being increasingly reported. Currently, hand function assessments for diagnosis or rehabilitation are primarily based on qualitative scales, which are subjective and may vary considerably depending on the expertise of the attending clinician. Although wearable sensors and computer vision techniques have been proposed to obtain quantitative hand movement information, both have limitations. In this study, a multiview video tracking and recording system was set up using high-speed cameras and mapping of actual hand movements. The state-of-the-art software DeepLabCut was used to obtain precise 2D and 3D finger joint positions. Kinematic parameters, such as movement count, period, phase, and Pearson coefficient were used to characterize hand movement based on the relative distance-time curves of finger joints. Experimental results in a clinical setting showed that this video-based image-recognition neural network method can accurately distinguish healthy from dysfunctional hand movements. The proposed system is inexpensive, easy to set up and use, and exhibits high accuracy. Thus, it can revolutionize medical hand motion analysis and spur the development of automated quantitative systems for early hand-related disorder detection.

AB  - PurposeWe describe the temporal concordance of 3 hemodynamic monitors. Materials and methodsHealthy volunteers performed preload changes while simultaneously wearing a non-invasive, pulse-contour stroke volume (SV) monitor, a bioreactance SV monitor and a wireless, wearable Doppler ultrasound patch over the common carotid artery. The sensitivity and specificity for detecting preload change over 3 temporal windows (early, middle and late) was assessed. Results40 preload changes were recorded in total (20 increase, 20 decrease). Immediately, the wearable Doppler had high sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%) for detecting preload change with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.98 for both velocity time integral (VTI, 10.5% threshold) and corrected flow time (FTc, 2.5% threshold). The sensitivity, specificity and AUROC for non-invasive pulse contour were equally good (9% SV threshold). For bioreactance, a 13% SV threshold immediately detected preload change with a sensitivity, specificity and AUROC of 60%, 95% and 0.75, respectively. After two SV outputs following preload change, the sensitivity, specificity and AUROC of bioreactance improved to 70%, 90% and 0.85, respectively. ConclusionsCarotid Doppler ultrasound and non-invasive pulse contour detected rapid hemodynamic change with equal accuracy; bioreactance improved over time. Algorithm-lag should be considered when interpreting clinical studies.

AB  - Background: In this study, we propose a method for automatically predicting atrial fibrillation (AF) based on convolutional neural network (CNN) using a short-term normal electrocardiogram (ECG) signal.
   Methods: We designed a CNN model and optimized it by dropout and normalization. One-dimensional convolution, max-pooling, and fully-connected multiple perceptron were used to analyze the short-term normal ECG. The ECG signal was preprocessed and segmented to train and evaluate the proposed CNN model. The training and test sets consisted of the two AF and one normal dataset from the MIT-BIH database.
   Results: The proposed CNN model for the automatic prediction of AF achieved a high performance with a sensitivity of 98.6%, a specificity of 98.7%, and an accuracy of 98.7%.
   Conclusion: The results show the possibility of automatically predicting AF based on the CNN model using a short-term normal ECG signal. The proposed CNN model for the automatic prediction of AF can be a helpful tool for the early diagnosis of AF in healthcare fields.

AB  - Background & aims: Cancer cachexia is commonly associated with poor prognosis in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). However, its pathophysiology and treatment are not well established. The current study aimed to assess the muscle mass/quality/strength, physical function and activity, resting energy expenditure (REE), and respiratory quotient (RQ) in cachectic patients with HNC.Methods: This prospective cross-sectional study analyzed 64 patients with HNC. Body composition was measured via direct segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis, and muscle quality was assessed using echo intensity on ultrasonography images. Muscle strength was investigated utilizing handgrip strength and isometric knee extension force (IKEF). Physical function was evaluated using the 10-m walking speed test and the five times sit-to-stand (5-STS) test. Physical activity was examined using a wearable triaxial accelerometer. REE and RQ were measured via indirect calorimetry. These parameters were compared between the cachectic and noncachectic groups.Results: In total, 23 (36%) patients were diagnosed with cachexia. The cachectic group had a significantly lower muscle mass than the noncachectic group. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in terms of fat between the two groups. The cachectic group had a higher quadriceps echo intensity and a lower handgrip strength and IKEF than the noncachectic group. Moreover, they had a significantly slower normal and maximum walking speed and 5-STS speed. The number of steps, total activity time, and time of activity (<3 Mets) did not significantly differ between the two groups. The cachectic group had a shorter time of activity (>= 3 Mets) than the noncachectic group. Furthermore, the cachectic group had a significantly higher REE/body weight and REE/fat free mass and a significantly lower RQ than the noncachectic group.Conclusions: The cachectic group had a lower muscle mass/quality/strength and physical function and activity and a higher REE than the noncachectic group. Thus, REE and physical activity should be evaluated to determine energy requirements. The RQ was lower in the cachectic group than that in the noncachectic group, indicating changes in energy substrate. Further studies must be conducted to examine effective nutritional and exercise interventions for patients with cancer cachexia.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Non-invasive measurement of physiological parameters and indicators, specifically among the elderly, is of utmost importance for personal health monitoring. In this study, we focused on photoplethysmography (PPG), and developed a regression model that calculates variables from the second (SDPPG) and third (TDPPG) derivatives of the PPG pulse that can observe the inflection point of the pulse wave measured by a wearable PPG device. The PPG pulse at the earlobe was measured for 3 min in 84 elderly Korean women (age: 71.19 +/- 6.97 years old). Based on the PPG-based cardiovascular function, we derived additional variables from TDPPG, in addition to the aging variable to predict the age. The Aging Index (AI) from SDPPG and Sum of TDPPG variables were calculated in the second and third differential forms of PPG. The variables that significantly correlated with age were c/a, Tac, AI of SDPPG, sum of TDPPG, and correlation coefficient 'r' of the model. In multiple linear regression analysis, the r value of the model was 0.308, and that using deep learning on the model was 0.839. Moreover, the possibility of improving the accuracy of the model using supervised deep learning techniques, rather than the addition of datasets, was confirmed.

AB  - The colorimetric gas sensor offers an opportunity for the simple and rapid detection of toxic gaseous substances based on visually discernible changes in the color of the sensing material. In particular, the accurate detection of trace amounts of certain biomarkers in a patient's breath provides substantial clues regarding specific diseases, for example, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) for halitosis and ammonia (NH3) for kidney disorder. However, conventional colorimetric sensors often lack the sensitivity, selectivity, detection limit, and mass-productivity, impeding their commercialization. Herein, we report an inexpensive route for the meter-scale synthesis of a colorimetric sensor based on a composite nanofiber yarn that is chemically functionalized with an ionic liquid as an effective H2S adsorbent and lead acetate as a colorimetric dye. As an eyereadable and weavable sensing platform, the single-strand yarn exhibits enhanced sensitivity supported by its high surface area and well-developed porosity to detect the breath biomarker (1 ppm of H2S). Alternatively, the yarn loaded with lead iodide dyes could reversibly detect NH3 gas molecules in the ppm-level, demonstrating the facile extensibility. Finally, we demonstrated that the freestanding yarns could be sewn into patterned textiles for the fabrication of a wearable toxic gas alarm system with a visual output.

AB  - Objective Utilizing integrated electronic health record (EHR) and consumer-grade wearable device data, we sought to provide real-world estimates for the proportion of wearers that would likely benefit from anticoagulation if an atrial fibrillation (AFib) diagnosis was made based on wearable device data. Materials and Methods This study utilized EHR and Apple Watch data from an observational cohort of 1802 patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center who linked devices to the EHR between April 25, 2015 and November 16, 2018. Using these data, we estimated the number of high-risk patients who would be actionable for anticoagulation based on (1) medical history, (2) Apple Watch wear patterns, and (3) AFib risk, as determined by an existing validated model. Results Based on the characteristics of this cohort, a mean of 0.25% (n = 4.58, 95% CI, 2.0-8.0) of patients would be candidates for new anticoagulation based on AFib identified by their Apple Watch. Using EHR data alone, we find that only approximately 36% of the 1802 patients (n = 665.93, 95% CI, 626.0-706.0) would have anticoagulation recommended even after a new AFib diagnosis. Discussion and Conclusion These data suggest that there is limited benefit to detect and treat AFib with anticoagulation among this cohort, but that accessing clinical and demographic data from the EHR could help target devices to the patients with the highest potential for benefit. Future research may analyze this relationship at other sites and among other wearable users, including among those who have not linked devices to their EHR.

AB  - Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cause of stroke and a marker of atherosclerosis and of all patients with stroke, around 17% have AF. The screening and treatment of AF could prevent about 12% of all strokes. Several relatively low-cost devices with good accuracy now exist which can detect AF including WatchBP and AliveCor. However, they can only measure the ECG or pulse over short time periods. Inexpensive devices such as heart rate monitors, which are widely available, can measure heart rate for prolonged periods and may have potential in screening for AF. This study aims to determine the accuracy of AliveCor and WatchBP along with a bespoke algorithm using a heart rate monitor belt (Polar H7) and a wearable RR interval recorder (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2) for detecting AF during a single screening visit in primary care patients.
   Methods/analysis A multicentre case-control diagnostic study comparing the four different devices for the detection of AF with a reference standard consisting of a 12-lead ECG in GP surgeries across Hampshire, UK. We aim to recruit 92 participants with AF and 329 without AF aged 65years and over. We will ask participants to rate comfort and overall impression for each device. We will collect qualitative data from participants capturing their experience of using wearable devices in order to evaluate acceptability. We will collect data from GPs to determine their views on AF screening.
   Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the LondonCity & East Research Ethics Committee in June 2016. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and the Atrial Fibrillation Association, UK.

AB  - In the present world, malignant growth in bosom is the commonly prevailing disease among women. Early bosom diagnosis and treatment are compulsory to diminish the death rates of bosom malignancy. Here, a dielectric differentiation is being detected among typical and malignant growth tissues, having applied ideal scope of frequencies. Winding radio wires becomes the most appropriate in this application due to its double polarization property where an adaptable substrate fulfils the wearable prerequisites. In this paper, the Winding Reception Apparatus is structured as a 4 x 4 exhibit with a goal that covers the greatest diameter of the bosom. The radio wire parameters such as expansion, direction and return misfortune are upgraded to get acceptable resistance, coordination and great reaction over the necessary recurrence. The receiving wires at the thickness 0.035 mm and with length, width of 19 mm and 15 mm are planned on an adaptable FR-4 substrate with a thickness of 0.4 mm. The proposed receiving wire cluster is structured and recreated in ADS programming for the recurrence scope of 2-4 GHz. In this regard, the obtained outcomes are contrasted and the foreordained qualities and nearness or non-appearance of the disease are distinguished.

AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) has shown to negatively impact physical recovery in a variety of medical events (e.g., stroke and spinal cord injuries). Yet depression assessments, which are typically subjective in nature, are seldom considered to develop or guide rehabilitation strategies. The present study developed a predictive depression assessment technique using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) that can be rapidly integrated or performed concurrently with existing physical rehabilitation tasks. Thirty-one volunteers, including 14 adults clinically diagnosed with MDD and 17 healthy adults, participated in the study. Brain oxy-hemodynamic (HbO) responses were recorded using a 16-channel wearable continuous-wave fNIRS device while the volunteers performed the Grasp and Release Test in four 16-minute blocks. Ten features, extracted from HbO signals, from each channel served as inputs to XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms developed for each block and combination of successive blocks. Top 5 common features resulted in a classification accuracy of 92.6%, sensitivity of 84.8%, and specificity of 91.7% using the XGBoost classifier. This study identified mean HbO, full width half maximum and kurtosis, as specific neuromarkers, for predicting MDD across specific depression-related regions of interests (i.e., dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). Our results suggest that a wearable fNIRS head probe monitoring specific brain regions, and limiting extraction to few features, can enable quick setup and rapid assessment of depression in patients. The overarching goal is to embed predictive neurotechnology during post-stroke and post-spinal-cord-injury rehabilitation sessions to monitor patients' depression symptomology so as to actively guide decisions about motor therapies.

AB  - Regular physical activity during pregnancy has a positive effect on the mother and fetus. However, there is scarce data regarding the effect of exercise in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim of the present parallel, non-randomized, open-label, pilot, clinical study was to examine the effect of two exercise programs on the resting metabolic rate (RMR) and substrate utilization in pregnancies complicated by GDM, compared with usual care (advice for the performance of exercise). Forty-three pregnant women diagnosed with GDM between the 24th and 28th gestational week, volunteered to participate. Three groups were formed: Usual care (n = 17), Walking (n = 14), and Mixed Exercise (n = 12). The Usual care group was given advice on maintaining habitual daily activities without any additional exercise. The Walking group exercised regularly by walking, in addition to the habitual daily activities. Finally, the Mixed Exercise group participated in a program combining aerobics and strength exercises. Training intensity was monitored continuously using lightweight, wearable monitoring devices. The Walking and Mixed Exercise groups participated in the training programs after being diagnosed with GDM and maintained them until the last week of gestation. RMR and substrate utilization were analyzed using indirect calorimetry for all participants twice: between 27th and 28th gestational week and as close as possible before delivery. No differences were observed between groups regarding body composition, age, and medical or obstetrical parameters before or after the exercise programs. RMR was increased after the completion of the exercise interventions in both the Walking (p = 0.001) and the Mixed Exercise arms (p = 0.002). In contrast, substrate utilization remained indifferent. In conclusion, regular exercise of moderate intensity (either walking, or a combination of aerobic and strength training) increases RMR in women with GDM compared to the lack of systematic exercise. However, based on the present, pilot data, these exercise regimes do not appear to alter resting substrate utilization.

AB  - To analyze the effect of early nursing intervention based on fetal heart signal extraction algorithm and Internet of Things (IoT) wireless communication technology on the adverse pregnancy outcomes of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and newborns, 88 pregnant women diagnosed with GDM who underwent the 75 g glucose tolerance test at 24-28 gestational weeks in the hospital were selected as the research objects. According to the different intervention methods, the patients were divided into 44 cases of the experimental group (nursing intervention based on maternal and infant monitoring system) and 44 cases of the control group (outpatient follow-up intervention). The results showed that the compliance score and diet compliance rate of patients in the experimental group were signally higher than those in the control group at 1 and 3 months after intervention (P < 0.05). The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood glucose 2 hours after the meal, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group at 1 and 3 months after intervention (P < 0.05). The number of giant babies, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, fetal distress, premature delivery, and birth weight in the experimental group was all lower than those in the control group, while the Apgar scores were higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). To sum up, the intervention based on the intelligent maternal and infant monitoring system could timely help pregnant women adjust their diet structure and optimize the management of blood glucose and blood lipids, thus effectively improving the adverse pregnancy outcome and maintaining the health of pregnant women and newborns.

AB  - A preload challenge (PC) is a clinical maneuver that, first, increases the cardiac filling (i.e., preload) and, second, calculates the change in cardiac output. Fundamentally, a PC is a bedside approach for testing the Frank-Starling-Sarnoff (i.e., "cardiac function") curve. Normally, this curve has a steep slope such that a small change in the cardiac preload generates a large change in the stroke volume (SV) or cardiac output. However, in various disease states, the slope of this relationship flattens such that increasing the volume into the heart leads to little rise in the SV. In this pathological scenario, additional cardiac preload (e.g., intravenous fluid) is unlikely to be physiologically effective and could lead to harm if organ congestion evolves. Therefore, inferring both the cardiac preload and output is clinically useful as it may guide intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation. Accordingly, the goal of this protocol is to describe a method for contemporaneously tracking the surrogates of cardiac preload and output using a novel, wireless, wearable ultrasound during a well-validated preload challenge.

AB  - Background: Lower extremity complications of diabetes represent major health care complications both in terms of cost and impact to quality of life for patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Temperature monitoring has been shown in previous studies to provide a useful signal of inflammation that may indicate the early presence of a foot injury.
   Objective: In this study, we evaluated the temperature data for patients that presented with a diabetic foot injury while using a sock-based remote temperature monitoring device.
   Methods: The study abstracted data from patients who were enrolled in a remote temperature monitoring program (2020-2021) using a smart sock (Siren Care). In the study cohort, a total of 5 participants with a diabetes-related lower extremity injury during the study period were identified. In the second comparison cohort, a total of 26 patients met the criteria for monitoring by the same methods but did not present with a diabetes-related podiatric lower extremity injury during the same period. The 15-day temperature differential between 6 defined locations on each foot was the primary outcome measure among subjects who presented with a diagnosed foot injury. Paired t tests were used to compare the differences between the two groups.
   Results: A significant difference in temperature differential (temperature measured in degrees F) was observed in the group that presented with a podiatric injury over the course of evaluation versus the comparator group that did not present with a podiatric injury. The average difference from all 6 measured points was 1.4 degrees F between the injury group (mean 3.6, SD 3.0) and the comparator group (mean 2.2, SD 2.5, t=-71.4, df=39; P<.001).
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest temperature monitoring in a sock form factor could be used to predict a developing foot injury. The continuous temperature monitoring system employed has implications for further algorithm development to enable early detection. The study was limited by a nonrandomized, observational design with limited injuries present in the study period. We look forward to further studies that will refine the predictive potential and confirm or refute the current promising data.

AB  - One of the challenges of the ageing population in many countries is the efficient delivery of health and care services, which is further complicated by the increase in neurological conditions among the elderly due to rising life expectancy. Personal care of the elderly is of concern to their relatives, in case they are alone in their homes and unforeseen circumstances occur, affecting their wellbeing. The alternative; i.e. care in nursing homes or hospitals is costly and increases further if specialized care is mobilized to patients' place of residence. Enabling technologies for independent living by the elderly such as the ambient assisted living systems (AALS) are seen as essential to enhancing care in a cost-effective manner. In light of significant advances in telecommunication, computing and sensor miniaturization, as well as the ubiquity of mobile and connected devices embodying the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT), end-to-end solutions for ambient assisted living have become a reality. The premise of such applications is the continuous and most often real-time monitoring of the environment and occupant behavior using an event-driven intelligent system, thereby providing a facility for monitoring and assessment, and triggering assistance as and when needed. As a growing area of research, it is essential to investigate the approaches for developing AALS in literature to identify current practices and directions for future research. This paper is, therefore, aimed at a comprehensive and critical review of the frameworks and sensor systems used in various ambient assisted living systems, as well as their objectives and relationships with care and clinical systems. Findings from our work suggest that most frameworks focused on activity monitoring for assessing immediate risks, while the opportunities for integrating environmental factors for analytics and decision-making, in particular for the long-term care were often overlooked. The potential for wearable devices and sensors, as well as distributed storage and access (e.g. cloud) are yet to be fully appreciated. There is a distinct lack of strong supporting clinical evidence from the implemented technologies. Socio-cultural aspects such as divergence among groups, acceptability and usability of AALS were also overlooked. Future systems need to look into the issues of privacy and cyber security.

AB  - Objective Research suggests physical activity (PA) improves behavioural, psychological and behavioural symptoms in individuals with binge eating disorder (BED), yet self-reported PA is notably low. Little remains known about objective rates of PA and subclinical levels of maladaptive PA (i.e., compensatory or driven PA), and few studies have attempted to understand the role that dissatisfaction and overvaluation with shape and weight plays in promoting PA in individuals with BED. We sought to characterize PA and investigate whether elevated rates of shape and weight concerns contribute to rates of PA in individuals with BED.
   Method Individuals meeting DSM-5 diagnosis of BED (N = 56) completed the Eating Disorder Examination and wore a Fitbit Flex 2 for 1 week.
   Results On average, participants recorded 7621.12 (SD = 3034.20) daily steps and 194.30 (SD = 161.45) weekly moderate-to-vigorous PA minutes. About 21% of participants reported subclinical levels of maladaptive PA. Greater shape and weight overvaluation predicted lower duration of compensatory PA.
   Conclusion A small percentage of individuals with BED are engaging in subclinical levels of maladaptive PA, and there is a need to identify factors that influence rates of PA in individuals with BED.

AB  - Mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is an emerging area that has received increasing attention in recent years, but still real-life validation for elderly residing in low and middle-income countries is scarce. We developed a wearable ECG monitor that is integrated with a self-designed wireless sensor for ECG signal acquisition. It is used with a native purposely designed smartphone application, based on machine learning techniques, for automated classification of captured ECG beats from aged people. When tested on 100 older adults, the monitoring system discriminated normal and abnormal ECG signals with a high degree of accuracy (97%), sensitivity (100%), and specificity (96.6%). With further verification, the system could be useful for detecting cardiac abnormalities in the home environment and contribute to prevention, early diagnosis, and effective treatment of cardiovascular diseases, while keeping costs down and increasing access to healthcare services for older persons.

AB  - Real-time monitoring of plantar pressure has significant applications in wearable biosensors, sports injury detection, and early diagnostics. Herein, an all-in-one insole composed of 24 capacitive pressure sensors (CPSs) with vertical pores in an elastic dielectric layer is fabricated by laser cutting. Optimized CPSs with a hexagonal configuration and a pore size of 600 mu m possess good linearity over a wide detection range of 0-200kPa with a sensitivity of 12x10(-3)kPa(-1). Then, a smart system including the all-in-one insole with the 24 CPS array, a data acquisition system with a wireless transmitter and a PC terminal with a wireless receiver is established for real-time monitoring to realize static and dynamic plantar pressure mapping. Based on this smart insole system, various standing and yoga postures can be distinguished, and variations in the center of gravity during walking can be recognized. This intelligent insole system provides great feasible supervision for health surveillance, injury prevention, and athlete training. Health: Another step forward for wearable sensorsA smart insole capable of monitoring a person's gait could see use in wearable medicine, injury detection, or help to restore a healthy posture. Smart technologies capable of measuring physiological signals can help to monitor and improve human health. Recently, devices capable of mapping plantar pressure and distribution are seeing increasing use as predictors of a variety of health-related issues, such as exhausted running or walking, risk of slipping, or for detecting senile dementia. Led by Rongrong Bao from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a team of researchers has developed an insole that uses an array of capacitive pressure sensors to monitor real-time data from static postures, such as standing or yoga poses, or dynamic activities like walking. The insole could see use as a wearable biosensor, in sports injury detection, or for diagnosing diseases.

AB  - Robotic hand exoskeletons can assist people who suffer from hand.functional disabilities caused by a stroke. However, currently existing hand exoskeletons remain inadequate in terms of user-friendly design, lightweight structure, and accurate modeling of hand motion. In this study, a large displacement compliant mechanism is developed as a finger exoskeleton. First, a topology configuration is developed which contains information on hand biomechanics and thus yields an efficient force-deflection mechanism for a finger. A pseudo-rigid-body model is then established using a large-deformation flexible hinge to solve the point flexure problem to create a finger exoskeleton that functions as intended. Finally, the mechanism synthesis method is used for parameter optimization to ensure that the output port of the device matches the motion of the finger. Using the proposed method, an integrated compliant finger exoskeleton is developed, and the performance of the exoskeleton is evaluated. The experimental result shows that the finger exoskeleton prototype provides suitable movement guidance for the index finger, which demonstrates that the proposed method may be a good way in the design of hand exoskeletons.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death worldwide. Conventional technologies for diagnosing and treating lack the compliance and comfort necessary for those living with life-threatening conditions. Soft electronics presents a promising outlet for conformal, flexible, and stretchable devices that can overcome the mechanical mismatch that is often associated with conventional technologies. Here, we review the various methods in which electronics have been made flexible and stretchable, to better interface with the human body, both externally with the skin and internally with the outer surface of the heart. Then, we review soft, wearable, noninvasive heart monitors designed to be attached to the chest or other parts of the body for mechano-acoustic and electrophysiological sensing. A common method of treatment for various abnormal heart rhythms involves catheter ablation procedures and we review the current soft bioelectronics that can be placed on the balloon or head of the catheter. Cardiac mapping is integral to determine the state of the heart; we discuss the various parameters for sensing aside from electrophysiological sensing, such as temperature, pH, strain, and tactile sensing. Finally, we review the soft devices that harvest energy from the natural and spontaneous beating of the heart by converting its mechanical motion into electrical energy to power implants.

AB  - Objective. The control of human bipedal locomotion is of great interest to the field of lower-body brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for gait rehabilitation. While the feasibility of closed-loop BCI systems for the control of a lower body exoskeleton has been recently shown, multi-day closed-loop neural decoding of human gait in a BCI virtual reality (BCI-VR) environment has yet to be demonstrated. BCI-VR systems provide valuable alternatives for movement rehabilitation when wearable robots are not desirable due to medical conditions, cost, accessibility, usability, or patient preferences. Approach. In this study, we propose a real-time closed-loop BCI that decodes lower limb joint angles from scalp electroencephalography ( EEG) during treadmill walking to control a walking avatar in a virtual environment. Fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials of EEG in the delta band (0.1-3 Hz) were used for prediction; thus, the EEG features correspond to time-domain amplitude modulated potentials in the delta band. Virtual kinematic perturbations resulting in asymmetric walking gait patterns of the avatar were also introduced to investigate gait adaptation using the closed-loop BCI-VR system over a period of eight days. Main results. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using a closed-loop BCI to learn to control a walking avatar under normal and altered visuomotor perturbations, which involved cortical adaptations. The average decoding accuracies ( Pearson's r values) in real-time BCI across all subjects increased from ( Hip: 0.18 +/- 0.31; Knee: 0.23 +/- 0.33; Ankle: 0.14 +/- 0.22) on Day 1 to (Hip: 0.40 +/- 0.24; Knee: 0.55 +/- 0.20; Ankle: 0.29 +/- 0.22) on Day 8. Significance. These findings have implications for the development of a real-time closed-loop EEG-based BCI-VR system for gait rehabilitation after stroke and for understanding cortical plasticity induced by a closed-loop BCI-VR system.

AB  - Respiration is as one of the most essential physiological signals, which can be used to monitor human healthcare and activities. Herein, we report a flexible, lightweight and highly conductive porous graphene network as the humidity sensor for respiration monitoring. To enhance the sensing performance, the graphene oxide (GO), poly (3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) and Ag colloids (AC) were used to modify the porous graphene. The humidity properties of porous based graphene networks have been investigated at different relative humidity (RH). The porous based graphene sensors exhibit excellent capability of monitoring different breathing patterns including mouse and nose respiration, normal and deep respiration. Besides, the signal variations before and after water intake was recorded by the sensor, which demonstrates the ability to monitor water loss during breathing period. Furthermore, the humidity sensor shows the ability to detect physiological activities including skin moisture, speaking and whistle rhythm, which could be a promising electronic for clinical respiration monitoring.

AB  - To avoid the pitfalls of self-reported dietary intake, wearable sensors can be used. Many food ingestion sensors offer the ability to automatically detect food intake using time resolutions that range from 23 ms to 8 min. There is no defined standard time resolution to accurately measure ingestive behavior or a meal microstructure. This paper aims to estimate the time resolution needed to accurately represent the microstructure of meals such as duration of eating episode, the duration of actual ingestion, and number of eating events. Twelve participants wore the automatic ingestion monitor (AIM) and kept a standard diet diary to report their food intake in free-living conditions for 24 h. As a reference, participants were also asked to mark food intake with a push button sampled every 0.1 s. The duration of eating episodes, duration of ingestion, and number of eating events were computed from the food diary, AIM, and the push button resampled at different time resolutions (0.1-30s). ANOVA and multiple comparison tests showed that the duration of eating episodes estimated from the diary differed significantly from that estimated by the AIM and the push button (p-value <0.001). There were no significant differences in the number of eating events for push button resolutions of 0.1, 1, and 5 s, but there were significant differences in resolutions of 10-30s (p-value <0.05). The results suggest that the desired time resolution of sensor-based food intake detection should be <= 5 s to accurately detect meal microstructure. Furthermore, the AIM provides more accurate measurement of the eating episode duration than the diet diary.

AB  - Sleep physiology and sleep hygiene play significant roles in maintaining the daily lives of individuals given that sleep is an important physiological need to protect the functions of the human brain. Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is an important disease that disturbs this need. Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS) are clinical conditions that affect all body organs and systems that intermittently, repeatedly, with at least 10 s or more breathing stops that decrease throughout the night and disturb sleep integrity. The aim of this study was to produce a new device for the treatment of patients especially with position and rapid eye movement (REM)-dependent mild and moderate OSAS. For this purpose, the main components of the device (the microphone (snore sensor), the heart rate sensor, and the vibration motor, which we named SNORAP) were applied to five volunteer patients (male, mean age: 33.2, body mass index mean: 29.3). After receiving the sound in real time with the microphone, the snoring sound was detected by using the Audio Fingerprint method with a success rate of 98.9%. According to the results obtained, the severity and the number of the snoring of the patients using SNORAP were found to be significantly lower than in the experimental conditions in the apnea hypopnea index (AHI), apnea index, hypopnea index, in supine position's AHI, and REM position's AHI before using SNORAP (Paired Sample Test, p < 0.05). REM sleep duration and nocturnal oxygen saturation were significantly higher when compared to the group not using the SNORAP (Paired Sample Test, p < 0.05).

AB  - Hemodialysis using hollow-fiber membranes provides life-sustaining treatment for nearly 2 million patients worldwide with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, patients on hemodialysis have worse long-term outcomes compared to kidney transplant or other chronic illnesses. Additionally, the underlying membrane technology of polymer hollow-fiber membranes has not fundamentally changed in over four decades. Therefore, we have proposed a fundamentally different approach using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication techniques to create thin-flat sheets of silicon-based membranes for implantable or portable hemodialysis applications. The silicon nanopore membranes (SNM) have biomimetic slit-pore geometry and uniform pores size distribution that allow for exceptional permeability and selectivity. A quantitative diffusion model identified structural limits to diffusive solute transport and motivated a new microfabrication technique to create SNM with enhanced diffusive transport. We performed in vitro testing and extracorporeal testing in pigs on prototype membranes with an effective surface area of 2.52 cm(2) and 2.02 cm(2), respectively. The diffusive clearance was a two-fold improvement in with the new microfabrication technique and was consistent with our mathematical model. These results establish the feasibility of using SNM for hemodialysis applications with additional scale-up.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, can be detected by smartphones and smartwatches.
   Introduction: Single-lead ECGs (iECGs) and photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors provide the opportunity for a broad, simple, and easily repeatable cardiac rhythm analysis. To reduce unnecessary medical follow-up testing due to false positive results, our aim was to find a screening approach applicable on smart devices with a focus on high specificity.
   Methods: We used PPG measurements from smartphones and smartwatches and iECG data from two previous validation trials. Two AF detection algorithms (A and B) were applied on the iECG dataset and compared directly. Further, we used 1-min PPG measurements as a first-pass filter for arrhythmia detection and simulated a sequential testing: Once an arrhythmia was detected in the PPG, the iECG counterpart of the patient was analyzed by algorithm A, B, or A + B combined although algorithm B was primarily designed for PPG analysis.
   Results: The iECGs from 1,288 participants were analyzed. Algorithm A did not show a diagnosis in 16.1%. In the remaining, sensitivity and specificity were 99.6%, and 97.4% respectively. Accuracy was 98.5%, and correct classification rate (CCR) was 82.7%. Algorithm B always differentiated between normal and arrhythmic and reached an overall sensitivity of 95.4%, a specificity of 91.6%, and an accuracy and CCR of 93.3%. Sequential testing by combining both algorithms into a three-phase test (Test positive PPG, then iECG analysis by A and B combined) resulted in a 100% specificity.
   Conclusion: Algorithm B performed strongly in PPG analysis as well as iECG analysis. PPG signals and consecutive iECG combined when an arrhythmia was detected by PPG resulted in a specificity that was higher than 99%.
   Discussion: The analysis allows a direct comparison of iECG algorithms without possible dilution by different measurement procedures or recording-devices. We improved specificity in AF-screening approaches with wearables by simulating a novel approach. Results rely on signal quality.

AB  - Monitoring and modeling biomedical, health care and wellness data from individuals and converging data on a population scale have tremendous potential to improve understanding of the transition to the healthy state of human physiology to disease setting. Wellness monitoring devices and companion software applications capable of generating alerts and sharing data with health care providers or social networks are now available. The accessibility and clinical utility of such data for disease or wellness research are currently limited. Designing methods for streaming data capture, real-time data aggregation, machine learning, predictive analytics and visualization solutions to integrate wellness or health monitoring data elements with the electronic medical records (EMRs) maintained by health care providers permits better utilization. Integration of population-scale biomedical, health care and wellness data would help to stratify patients for active health management and to understand clinically asymptomatic patients and underlying illness trajectories. In this article, we discuss various health-monitoring devices, their ability to capture the unique state of health represented in a patient and their application in individualized diagnostics, prognosis, clinical or wellness intervention. We also discuss examples of translational bioinformatics approaches to integrating patient-generated data with existing EMRs, personal health records, patient portals and clinical data repositories. Briefly, translational bioinformatics methods, tools and resources are at the center of these advances in implementing real-time biomedical and health care analytics in the clinical setting.

AB  - Medicine is heading towards personalized care based on individual situations and conditions. With smartphones and increasingly miniaturized wearable devices, the sensors available on these devices can perform long-term continuous monitoring of several user health-related parameters, making them a powerful tool for a new medicine approach for these patients. Our proposed system, described in this article, aims to develop innovative solutions based on artificial intelligence techniques to empower patients with cardiovascular disease. These solutions will realize a novel 5P (Predictive, Preventive, Participatory, Personalized, and Precision) medicine approach by providing patients with personalized plans for treatment and increasing their ability for self-monitoring. Such capabilities will be derived by learning algorithms from physiological data and behavioral information, collected using wearables and smart devices worn by patients with health conditions. Further, developing an innovative system of smart algorithms will also focus on providing monitoring techniques, predicting extreme events, generating alarms with varying health parameters, and offering opportunities to maintain active engagement of patients in the healthcare process by promoting the adoption of healthy behaviors and well-being outcomes. The multiple features of this future system will increase the quality of life for cardiovascular diseases patients and provide seamless contact with a healthcare professional.

AB  - Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death in developing countries. Lifestyle disorders are one of the precursors of CHD. Exercise-based cardiac health rehabilitation is often prescribed as a secondary prevention strategy to reduce the impact of CHD. To monitor the exercise's impact on the cardiac parameters, a simulation platform is required to predict the cardiovascular parameters of an individual during exercise. So, in this paper, our objective is to model an in-silico cardiac platform to simulate the exercise effect on the cardiac parameters relevant to cardiac rehabilitation. The proposed framework encompasses a novel cardiovascular hemodynamic model for simulating an individual's exercise condition using an ECG signal and the metabolic equivalent of task (MET) value approximated from a wearable device. The Neuromodulation parameters such as heart rate and cardiac compliances are estimated from the morphology of the ECG signal. The exercise modulated systemic resistances for the coupled hemodynamic model are assessed based on the MET values of the activity levels to meet additional blood demand during exercises. Effects of exercise on cardiac parameters are simulated on two open-source datasets for healthy subjects, namely Troika and Kaggle, and several hemodynamic parameters are evaluated. The model simulated blood pressure (BP) shows a correlation coefficient of 0.99 (for systolic BP) and 0.95 (for diastolic BP) with Kaggle data BP. The effect of exercise on a diseased heart is demonstrated through a case of silent ischemia. The proposed simulation platform is intended to be used for cardiac rehabilitation monitoring aid for both healthy and patients suffering from heart diseases, providing a cardiac care continuum.

AB  - Microcalcification clusters in mammograms are one of the major signs of breast cancer. However, the detection of microcalcifications from mammograms is a challenging task for radiologists due to their tiny size and scattered location inside a denser breast composition. Automatic CAD systems need to predict breast cancer at the early stages to support clinical work. The intercluster gap, noise between individual MCs, and individual object's location can affect the classification performance, which may reduce the true-positive rate. In this study, we propose a computer-vision-based FC-DSCNN CAD system for the detection of microcalcification clusters from mammograms and classification into malignant and benign classes. The computer vision method automatically controls the noise and background color contrast and directly detects the MC object from mammograms, which increases the classification performance of the neural network. The breast cancer classification framework has four steps: image preprocessing and augmentation, RGB to grayscale channel transformation, microcalcification region segmentation, and MC ROI classification using FC-DSCNN to predict malignant and benign cases. The proposed method was evaluated on 3568 DDSM and 2885 PINUM mammogram images with automatic feature extraction, obtaining a score of 0.97 with a 2.35 and 0.99 true-positive ratio with 2.45 false positives per image, respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the performance of the proposed method remains higher than the traditional and previous approaches.

AB  - BackgroundBarth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth abnormalities and often leads to death in childhood. Recently, elamipretide has been tested as a potential first disease-modifying drug. This study aimed to identify patients with BTHS who may respond to elamipretide, based on continuous physiological measurements acquired through wearable devices.ResultsData from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 12 patients with BTHS were used, including physiological time series data measured using a wearable device (heart rate, respiratory rate, activity, and posture) and functional scores. The latter included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue score, SWAY Balance Mobile Application score (SWAY balance score), BTHS Symptom Assessment (BTHS-SA) Total Fatigue score, muscle strength by handheld dynamometry, 5 times sit-and-stand test (5XSST), and monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin ratio (MLCL:CL). Groups were created through median split of the functional scores into "highest score" and "lowest score", and "best response to elamipretide" and "worst response to elamipretide". Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) models were implemented to assess whether physiological data could classify patients according to functional status and distinguish non-responders from responders to elamipretide. AHC models clustered patients according to their functional status with accuracies of 60-93%, with the greatest accuracies for 6MWT (93%), PROMIS (87%), and SWAY balance score (80%). Another set of AHC models clustered patients with respect to their response to treatment with elamipretide with perfect accuracy (all 100%).ConclusionsIn this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that continuously acquired physiological measurements from wearable devices can be used to predict functional status and response to treatment among patients with BTHS.

AB  - The monitoring of sleep patterns without patient's inconvenience or involvement of a medical specialist is a clinical question of significant importance. To this end, we propose an automatic sleep stage monitoring system based on an affordable, unobtrusive, discreet, and long-term wearable in-ear sensor for recording the electroencephalogram (ear-EEG). The selected features for sleep pattern classification from a single ear-EEG channel include the spectral edge frequency and multi-scale fuzzy entropy, a structural complexity feature. In this preliminary study, the manually scored hypnograms from simultaneous scalp EEG and ear-EEG recordings of four subjects are used as labels for two analysis scenarios: 1) classification of ear-EEG hypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings; and 2) prediction of scalp-EEG hypnogram labels from ear-EEG recordings. We consider both 2-class and 4-class sleep scoring, with the achieved accuracies ranging from 78.5% to 95.2% for ear-EEG labels predicted from ear-EEG, and 76.8% to 91.8% for scalp-EEG labels predicted from ear-EEG. The corresponding Kappa coefficients range from 0.64 to 0.83 for Scenario 1, and indicate substantial to almost perfect agreement, while for Scenario 2 the range of 0.65-0.80 indicates substantial agreement, thus further supporting the feasibility of in-ear sensing for sleep monitoring in the community.

AB  - The global pandemic of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is dramatically changing the lives of humans and results in limitation of activities, especially physical activities, which lead to various health issues such as cardiovascular, diabetes, and gout. Physical activities are often viewed as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it offers enormous health benefits; on the other hand, it can cause irreparable damage to health. Falls during physical activities are a significant cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries. Therefore, continuous monitoring of physical activities is crucial during the quarantine period to detect falls. Even though wearable sensors can detect and recognize human physical activities, in a pandemic crisis, it is not a realistic approach. Smart sensing with the support of smartphones and other wireless devices in a non-contact manner is a promising solution for continuously monitoring physical activities and assisting patients suffering from serious health issues. In this research, a non-contact smart sensing through the walls (TTW) platform is developed to monitor human physical activities during the quarantine period using software-defined radio (SDR) technology. The developed platform is intelligent, flexible, portable, and has multi-functional capabilities. The received orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals with fine-grained 64-subcarriers wireless channel state information (WCSI) are exploited for classifying different activities by applying machine learning algorithms. The fall activity is classified separately from standing, walking, running, and bending with an accuracy of 99.7% by using a fine tree algorithm. This preliminary smart sensing opens new research directions to detect COVID-19 symptoms and monitor non-communicable and communicable diseases.

AB  - Researchers utilize mobile imaging, pervasive sensing, social media, and location tracking (MISST) technologies to observe and intervene with participants in their natural environment. The use of MISST methods and tools introduces unique ethical issues due to the type and quantity of data, and produces raising new challenges around informed consent, risk assessment, and data management. Since MISST methods are relatively new in behavioral research, there is little documented evidence to guide institutional review board (IRB) risk assessment and inform appropriate risk management strategies. This study was conducted to contribute the participant perspectives when considering ethical and responsible practices. Participants (n = 82) enrolled in an observational study where they wore several MISST devices for 1 week completed an exit survey. Survey items focused on the following: 1-device comfort, 2-informed consent, 3-privacy protections, and 4-bystander engagement. The informed consent process reflected participant actual experience. Device comfort and privacy were raised as concerns to both the participants and bystanders. While the majority of the participants reported a positive experience, it is important to note that the participants were volunteers who were not mandated to wear tracking devices and that persons who are mandated may not have a similar response. Findings support strategies proposed in the Kelly et al. (2013) ethical framework, which emphasizes procedures to improve informed consent, protect privacy, manage data, and respect bystander rights when using a wearable camera.

AB  - Introduction Physical activity (PA) during first 20 weeks of pregnancy may lower risks of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and gestational hypertension (GH), though evidence of association remains inconclusive. Current studies rely heavily on subjective assessment of PA levels. Wearable activity trackers provide a convenient and objective surrogate index for PA validated by evidence-based steps/day categorisation along a physical inactivity/activity continuum. I-ACT primarily aims to examine objectively measured PA levels and patterns in first and second trimesters of pregnancy and the association with GDM and/or GH in Singapore, a multiethnic Asian population. Secondary aims include investigating the bio-socio-demographic factors associated with sedentary behaviour, and association of early pregnancy PA level with maternal weight at 6 weeks postdelivery. Results may facilitate identification of high-risk mothers-to-be and formulation of interventional strategies.
   Methods and analysis Prospective cohort study that will recruit 408 women at first antenatal visit at <12 weeks' gestation. Baseline bio-socio-demographic factors and PA levels assessed by participant characteristics form and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), respectively. An activity tracker (Fitbit) will be provided to be worn daily from date of recruitment to end of 20 weeks' gestation. Tracker-recorded data will be synchronised with an application on participant's smartphone. Compliance will be reinforced with fortnightly reminders.

AB  - The non-invasive Blood Pressure Estimation (BPE) utilizing the technology of photoplethysmography (PPG) gains significant interest because PPG could be extensively employed to wearable sensors. Here, a method for estimating Systolic Blood pressure (SBP), as well as Diastolic Blood pressure (DBP), grounded only on a PPG signal utilizing the Image Denoising Algorithms (IDA) algorithms is proposed. Also, a classification methodology to execute the risk analysis (RA) of the BP patients utilizing Moore-Penrose Pseudo-Inverse Matrix-Deep Learning Neural Network (MPPIW-DLNN) is proposed. The preprocessing is then done on the input PPG signal utilizing the Modified-Chebyshev Filter (CF) to eradicate the unwanted information existent in the signal. Afterward, the BPE is done utilizing IDA, which categorizes those components into (i) SBP and (ii) DBP. The MPPIW-DLNN provides the results of four sorts of risk classes like (i) stroke, (ii) heart failure (HF), (iii) heart attack (HA), and (iv) aneurysm identified from the inputted PPG signal.

AB  - Wearable sensors and IoT technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of vital signals and created new perception of medical patient-care strategies. Atrial fibrillation (AF) as the most common cardiac arrhythmia that is associated with increased risks of strokes can be detected in ECG signals using wireless body sensors. In depth, these devices can be deployed to capture and transmit raw ECG signals to a remote server for AF detection and further ECG classification. However, the transmission of raw ECG samples over energy-consuming wireless links limits the sensor's battery lifetime and questions the application's practicality. The design of an on-sensor AF energy efficient detection method is still an open research issue challenged by the sensor processing capability and its lifetime. This paper proposes a new ECG processing scheme for AF detection intended to be implemented in WBSN. It presents a low-complexity time-domain features' extraction method that combines the RR interval and p-wave absence in the ECG segment for higher AF detection accuracy. The proposed method achieved 100% sensitivity and 96% specifity while saving 92% of energy compared to full ECG data transmission. Thus demonstrating the technical feasibility of energy-efficiency for on-sensor AF detection.

AB  - In this study, a highly transformable electrocardiograph that can considerably deform the position of stretchable electrodes based on the lead method for diagnosing heart disease was developed; these electrodes exhibited high resistance stability against considerable stretching and multiple stretching. To realize the large deformable functionality of the electrodes of a system, liquid metal electrodes and a heteroconnector composed of a liquid metal paste and carbon-based conductive rubber were employed. The developed device can achieve a 200% strain with only 6% resistance change and a high stability of resistances after the 100-time stretching test. In addition, the study demonstrated electrocardiograms in different lead methods of adult and child using the same device. The proposed combination of large deformable electrodes with high electric stability and a robust heteroconnector is an important technology, and it presents a considerable advancement in the application of stretchable electronic systems.

AB  - This paper introduces a new device for gait rehabilitation, the gait propulsion trainer (GPT). It consists of two main components (a stationary device and a wearable system) that work together to apply periodic stance-phase resistance as the user walks overground. The stationary device provides the resistance forces via a cable that tethers the user's pelvis to a magnetic-particle brake. The wearable system detects gait events via foot switches to control the timing of the resistance forces. A hardware verification test confirmed that the GPT functions as intended. We conducted a pilot study in which one healthy adult and one stroke survivor walked with the GPT with increasing resistance levels. As hypothesized, the periodic stance-phase resistance caused the healthy participant to walk asymmetrically, with greatly reduced propulsion impulse symmetry; as GPT resistance increased, the walking speed also decreased, and the propulsion impulse appeared to increase for both legs. In contrast, the stroke participant responded to GPT resistance by walking faster and more symmetrically in terms of both propulsion impulse and step length. Thus, this paper shows promising results of short-term training with the GPT, and more studies will follow to explore its long-term effects on hemiparetic gait.

AB  - Featured Application During sports training, it is relevant to monitor performance parameters, as, for example, stroke and kick count in swimmers. However, as stroke number can be detected by using a wearable "swim stroke meter", the number of kicks is usually detected by acquiring video images, which requires dedicated staff. The availability of a wearable kick-count device may be an opportunity to better monitor swim performance also during individual training. Monitoring sports training performances with automatic, low cost, low power, and ergonomic solutions is a topic of increasing importance in the research of the last years. A parameter of particular interest, which has not been extensively dealt with in a state-of-the-art way, is the count of kicks during swimming training sessions. Coaches and athletes set the training sessions to optimize the kick count and swim stroke rate to acquire velocity and acceleration during swimming. In regard to race distances, counting kicks can influence the athlete's performance. However, it is difficult to record the kick count without facing some issues about subjective interpretation. In this paper, a new method for kick count is proposed, based on only one triaxial accelerometer worn on the athlete's ankle. The algorithm was validated on data recorded during freestyle training sessions. An accuracy of 97.5% with a sensitivity of 99.3% was achieved. The proposed method shows good linearity and a slope of 1.01. These results overcome other state-of-the-art methods, proving that this method is a good candidate for a reliable, embedded kick count.

AB  - An electroencephalogram (EEG)-connectome processor to monitor and diagnose mental health is proposed. From 19-channel EEG signals, the proposed processor determines whether the mental state is healthy or unhealthy by extracting significant features from EEG signals and classifying them. Connectome approach is adopted for the best diagnosis accuracy, and synchronization likelihood (SL) is chosen as the connectome feature. Before computing SL, reconstruction optimizer (ReOpt) block compensates some parameters, resulting in improved accuracy. During SL calculation, a sparse matrix inscription (SMI) scheme is proposed to reduce the memory size to 1/24. From the calculated SL information, a small world feature extractor (SWFE) reduces the memory size to 1/29. Finally, using SLs or small word features, radial basis function (RBF) kernel-based support vector machine (SVM) diagnoses user's mental health condition. For RBF kernels, look-up-tables (LUTs) are used to replace the floating-point operations, decreasing the required operation by 54%. Consequently, The EEG-connectome processor improves the diagnosis accuracy from 89% to 95% in Alzheimer's disease case. The proposed processor occupies 3.8 mm2 and consumes 1.71 mW with 0.18 mu m CMOS technology.

AB  - We have developed a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence goggle system based on the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor active pixel sensor imaging and see-through display technologies. The fluorescence goggle system is a compact wearable intraoperative fluorescence imaging and display system that can guide surgery in real time. The goggle is capable of detecting fluorescence of indocyanine green solution in the picomolar range. Aided by NIR quantum dots, we successfully used the fluorescence goggle to guide sentinel lymph node mapping in a rat model. We further demonstrated the feasibility of using the fluorescence goggle in guiding surgical resection of breast cancer metastases in the liver in conjunction with NIR fluorescent probes. These results illustrate the diverse potential use of the goggle system in surgical procedures. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

AB  - The development of precise virtual entities of human bodies has been pursued for many years, but to date, there have been few positive reports. In recent years, the success of digital twin (DT) technology in industrial applications has led to greater interest in establishing human-body DT models. In particular, many recent advances in materials science, electrical engineering, and computer engineering have exhibited the intrinsic power of DT models in the detection and processing of complex body signals, indicating that the goals of establishing human-body DTs are getting "within reach." Herein, current DT technologies in industry are discussed and advanced electronics and artificial intelligent algorithms are reviewed, which are must-have building blocks for human DTs. Finally, perspectives on the use of human-body DTs in improving the quality of life and introduction of never-have immersive virtual reality experiences are discussed.

AB  - Understanding and recognizing human activities is a fundamental research topic for a wide range of important applications such as fall detection and remote health monitoring and intervention. Despite active research in human activity recognition over the past years, existing approaches based on computer vision or wearable sensor technologies present several significant issues such as privacy (e.g., using video camera to monitor the elderly at home) and practicality (e.g., not possible for an older person with dementia to remember wearing devices). In this paper, we present a low-cost, unobtrusive, and robust system that supports independent living of older people. The system interprets what a person is doing by deciphering signal fluctuations using radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology and machine learning algorithms. To deal with noisy, streaming, and unstable RFID signals, we develop a compressive sensing, dictionary-based approach that can learn a set of compact and informative dictionaries of activities using an unsupervised subspace decomposition. In particular, we devise a number of approaches to explore the properties of sparse coefficients of the learned dictionaries for fully utilizing the embodied discriminative information on the activity recognition task. Our approach achieves efficient and robust activity recognition via a more compact and robust representation of activities. Extensive experiments conducted in a real-life residential environment demonstrate that our proposed system offers a good overall performance and shows the promising practical potential to underpin the applications for the independent living of the elderly.

AB  - Background: There is a pressing need to reduce the hospitalization rate of heart failure patients to limit rising health care costs and improve outcomes. Tracking physiologic changes to detect early deterioration in the home has the potential to reduce hospitalization rates through early intervention. However, classical approaches to in-home monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as a major barrier. This work presents a toilet seat-based cardiovascular monitoring system that has the potential to address low patient adherence as it does not require any change in habit or behavior.
   Objective: The objective of this work was to demonstrate that a toilet seat-based cardiovascular monitoring system with an integrated electrocardiogram, ballistocardiogram, and photoplethysmogram is capable of clinical-grade measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, stroke volume, and peripheral blood oxygenation.
   Methods: The toilet seat-based estimates of blood pressure and peripheral blood oxygenation were compared to a hospital-grade vital signs monitor for 18 subjects over an 8-week period. The estimated stroke volume was validated on 38 normative subjects and 111 subjects undergoing a standard echocardiogram at a hospital clinic for any underlying condition, including heart failure.
   Results: Clinical grade accuracy was achieved for all of the seat measurements when compared to their respective gold standards. The accuracy of diastolic blood pressure and systolic blood pressure is 1.2 ( SD 6.0) mm Hg ( N=112) and -2.7 ( SD 6.6) mm Hg ( N=89), respectively. Stroke volume has an accuracy of -2.5 ( SD 15.5) mL ( N=149) compared to an echocardiogram gold standard. Peripheral blood oxygenation had an RMS error of 2.3% ( N=91).
   Conclusions: A toilet seat-based cardiovascular monitoring system has been successfully demonstrated with blood pressure, stroke volume, and blood oxygenation accuracy consistent with gold standard measures. This system will be uniquely positioned to capture trend data in the home that has been previously unattainable. Demonstration of the clinical benefit of the technology requires additional algorithm development and future clinical trials, including those targeting a reduction in heart failure hospitalizations.

AB  - Purpose: Here we explore the prognostic value of baseline step count data captured using wearable devices for patients treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Methods and Materials: Patients with locally advanced NSCLC wore a commercial fitness tracker during a course of definitive, concurrent chemoradiation therapy as part of a clinical trial. Baseline step count average was defined as the average daily step total from study enrollment until completion of the first week of radiation therapy. Based on data from healthy individuals, study subjects were categorized as inactive (below the 25th percentile), moderately active (25th to 75th percentile), or highly active (above the 75th percentile). Fisher's exact test was used to examine activity level as a predictor of hospitalization during radiation therapy and of completing the planned radiation therapy course without delay exceeding 1 week. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) durations were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Inactivity was tested as a predictor of PFS and OS using Cox proportional hazards models.
   Results: Fifty subjects met eligibility criteria. Nine (18%) were categorized as highly active, 23 (46%) were moderately active, and 18 (36%) were inactive. Inactive subjects were more likely to be hospitalized during the radiation therapy course than other subjects (50% vs 9%, P = .004) and less likely to complete radiation therapy without delay exceeding 1 week (67% vs 97%, P = .006). Median PFS duration was 5.3 months for inactive subjects and 18.3 months for others (hazard ratio for inactivity = 5.10, P < .001). Median OS duration was 15.0 months for inactive subjects and not reached for others (hazard ratio = 3.91, P = .004). Performance status was not a significant predictor of PFS or OS.
   Conclusions: Baseline activity level measured using wearable devices may help identify patients with NSCLC who are fit for concurrent chemoradiation therapy and can predict clinical outcomes in this setting. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Materials science can pave the way toward developing novel devices at the service of human life. In recent years, computational materials engineering has been promising in predicting material performance prior to the experiments. Herein, this capability has been carefully employed to tackle severe problems associated with kidney diseases through proposing novel nanolayers to adsorb urea and accordingly causing the wearable artificial kidney (WAK) to be viable. The two-dimensional metal carbide and nitride (MXene) nanosheets can leverage the performance of various devices since they are highly tunable along with fascinating surface chemistry properties. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were exploited to investigate the interactions between urea and different MXene nanosheets. To this end, detailed analyses were performed that clarify the suitability of these nanostructures in urea adsorption. The atomistic simulations were carried out on Mn2C, Cd2C, Cu2C, Ti2C, W2C, Ta2C, and urea to determine the most appropriate urea-removing adsorbent. It was found that Cd2C was more efficient followed by Mn2C, which can be effectively exploited in WAK devices at the service of human health.

AB  - Background Aging is the most significant risk factor for dementia. Alzheimer's disease (AD) accounts for approximately 60-80% of all dementia cases in older adults. This study aimed to examine the relationship between finger movements and brain volume in AD patients using a voxel-based reginal analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) software.
   Methods Patients diagnosed with AD at the Center for Comprehensive Care and Research on Memory Disorders were included. The diagnostic criteria were based on the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association. A finger-tapping device was used for all measurements. Participants performed the tasks in the following order: with their non-dominant hand, dominant hand, both hands simultaneously, and alternate hands. Movements were measured for 15 s each. The relationship between distance and output was measured. Magnetic resonance imaging measurements were performed, and VSRAD was conducted using sagittal section 3D T1-weighted images. The Z-score was used to calculate the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy. Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient analyzed the relationship between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and mean values of the parameters in the finger-tapping movements. The statistical significance level was set at <5%. The calculated p-values were corrected using the Bonferroni method.
   Results Sixty-two patients were included in the study. Comparison between VSRAD and MoCA-J scores corrected for p-values showed a significant negative correlation with the extent of gray matter atrophy (r = -0. 52; p< 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between the severity of medial temporal lobe atrophy and standard deviation (SD) of the distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements in the non-dominant hand (r = 0. 51; p< 0.001).
   Conclusions The SD of distance rate of velocity peak in extending movements extracted from finger taps may be a useful parameter for the early detection of AD and diagnosis of its severity.

AB  - Patients and healthcare staff are under-equipped to optimise outcomes. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using an ear-worn motion sensor (e-AR, Imperial College London) to conduct objective, home-based mobility assessments in the peri-operative setting.
   Methods: Fourteen patients on the waiting list for knee replacement, and 15 healthy subjects, were recruited. Pre-operatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks post-operatively, patients underwent functional mobility testing (Timed Up and Go), knee examination (including range of motion), and an activity protocol whilst wearing the e-AR sensor. Features extracted from sensor motion data were used to assess patient performance and predict patients' recovery phase.
   Results: Sensor-derived peri-operative mobility trends correlated with clinical measures in several activities, allowing functional recovery of individual subjects to be profiled and compared, including the detection of a complication. Sensor data features enabled classification of subjects into normal, preoperative and 24-week post-operative groups with 89% (median) accuracy. Classification accuracy was reduced to 69% when including all time intervals.
   Discussion: This study demonstrates a novel, objective method of assessing peri-operative mobility, which could be used to supplement surgical decision-making and facilitate community-based follow-up. (C) 2015 IJS Publishing Group Limited. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder with multiple comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders. Detected based on an overnight sleep study is called polysomnography (PSG); OSA still remains undiagnosed in majority of the population mainly attributed to lack of awareness. To overcome the limitations posed by PSG such as patient discomfort and overnight hospitalization, newer technologies are being explored. In addition, challenges associated with current management of OSA using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), etc. presents several pitfalls. Areas Covered Conventional and modern detection/management techniques including PSG, CPAP, smart wearable/pillows, bio-motion sensors, etc., have both pros and cons. To fulfill the limitations in OSA diagnostics, there is an imperative need for new technology for screening of symptomatic and more importantly asymptomatic OSA patients to reduce the risk of several associated life-threatening comorbidities. In this line, molecular marker-based diagnostics have shown great promises. Expert Opinion A detailed overview is presented on the OSA management and diagnostic approaches and recent advances in the molecular screening methods. The potentials of biomarker-based detection and its limitations are also portrayed and a comparison between the standard, current modern approaches, and promising futuristic technologies for OSA diagnostics and management is set forth.

AB  - Concordant assessments of physical activity (PA) and related measures in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is essential for exercise prescription. This study compared exercise measurement from an in-person walk test; wearable activity tracker; and self-report at CR entry, completion (8-weeks) and follow-up (16-weeks). Forty patients beginning CR completed the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE), and wore Fitbit-Flex for four consecutive days including two weekend days. The sample mean age was 66 years; 67% were male. Increased exercise capacity at CR completion and follow-up was detected by a 6MWT change in mean distance (39 m and 42 m; p = 0.01, respectively). Increased PA participation at CR completion was detected by Fitbit-Flex mean change in step counts (1794; p = 0.01). Relative changes for Fitbit-Flex step counts and a 6MWT were consistent with previous research, demonstrating Fitbit-Flex's potential as an outcome measure. With four days of data, Fitbit-Flex had acceptable ICC values in measuring step counts and MVPA minutes. Fitbit-Flex steps and 6MWT meters are more responsive to changes in PA patterns following exposure to a cardiac rehabilitation program than Fitbit-Flex or PASE-estimated moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) minutes. Fitbit-Flex step counts provide a useful additional measure for assessing PA outside of the CR setting and accounts for day-to-day variations. Two weekend days and two weekdays are needed for Fitbit-Flex to estimate PA levels more precisely.

AB  - Early detection of influenza may improve responses against outbreaks. This study was part of a clinical study assessing the efficacy of a novel influenza vaccine, aiming to discover distinct, highly predictive patterns of pre-symptomatic illness based on changes in advanced physiological parameters using a novel wearable sensor. Participants were frequently monitored 24 h before and for nine days after the influenza challenge. Viral load was measured daily, and self-reported symptoms were collected twice a day. The Random Forest classifier model was used to classify the participants based on changes in the measured parameters. A total of 116 participants with similar to 3,400,000 data points were included. Changes in parameters were detected at an early stage of the disease, before the development of symptomatic illness. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance showed the greatest changes in the third post-exposure day, correlating with viral load. Applying the classifier model identified participants as flu-positive or negative with an accuracy of 0.81 +/- 0.05 two days before major symptoms appeared. Cardiac index and diastolic blood pressure were the leading predicting factors when using data from the first and second day. This study suggests that frequent remote monitoring of advanced physiological parameters may provide early pre-symptomatic detection of flu.

AB  - Blood clotting is a serious clinical complication of many medical procedures and disorders including surgery, catheterization, transplantation, extracorporeal circuits, infections, and cancer. This complication leads to high patient morbidity and mortality due to clot-induced pulmonary embolism, stroke, and in some cases heart attack. Despite the clear medical significance. little progress has been made in developing the methods for detection of circulating blood clots (CBCs), also called emboli. We recently demonstrated the application of in vivo photoacoustic (PA) flow cytometly (PAFC) with unfocused ultrasound transducers for detection of CBCs in small vessels in a mouse model. In the current study, we extend applicability of PAFC for detection of CBCs in relatively large (1.5-2 mm) and deep (up to 56 mm) blood vessels in rat and rabbit models using a high pulse rate 1064 nm laser and focused ultrasound transducer with a central hole for an optic fiber. Employing phantoms and chemical activation of clotting, we demonstrated PA identification of white, red, and mixed CBCs producing negative, positive, and mixed PA contrast in blood background, respectively. We confirmed that PAFC can detect both red and white CBCs induced by microsurgical procedures, such as a needle or catheter insertion, as well as stroke modeled by injection of artificial clots. Our results show great potential for a PAFC diagnostic platform with a wearable PA fiber probe for diagnosis of thrombosis and embolism in vivo that is impossible with existing techniques.

AB  - This research suggests a fuzzy-logic based terrain identification method and the smart prosthetic ankle system, which automatically controls its ankle angle, based on the detected terrain environment, to assist comfortable gait performance of transtibial amputee. Suggested terrain identification method uses shank angle from three different stages of the stance phase in gait cycle (foot-flat, heel-strike, and toe-off) as input for the fuzzy-logic calculation, and detects five different terrain environment (flat, up-slope, down-slope, up-stairs, and down-stairs) within a single step of gait. Suggested smart prosthetic ankle system comprises of 1) load-cell to measure GRF (ground reaction force), 2) IMU (inertial measurement unit) sensor to measure shank angle, 3) actuator and four bar-linkage mechanism to control ankle angle accordingly for detected terrain environment, and 4) MCU (microcontroller unit) to carry out calculations and control algorithm for ankle actuation. To verify the accuracy of the terrain identification method of the system, the experiment was conducted, which consisted of four transtibial amputees to walk on five different terrain conditions, and the result has shown 97.5% detection accuracy. Compared to previous studies, our suggested smart prosthetic ankle system, along with its terrain identification algorithm, uses lesser number of sensors and step cycle to accurately detect gait environment, which may lead to providing better gait assistance and practical convenience for transtibial amputees.

AB  - Continuous and non-invasive monitoring of hemodynamic parameters through unobtrusive wearable sensors can potentially aid in early detection of cardiac abnormalities, and provides a viable solution for long-term follow-up of patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases without disrupting the daily life activities. Electrocardiogram (ECG) and siesmocardiogram (SCG) signals can be readily acquired from light-weight electrodes and accelerometers respectively, which can be employed to derive systolic time intervals (STI). For this purpose, automated and accurate annotation of the relevant peaks in these signals is required, which is challenging due to the inter-subject morphological variability and noise prone nature of SCG signal. In this paper, an approach is proposed to automatically annotate the desired peaks in SCG signal that are related to STI by utilizing the information of peak detected in the sliding template to narrow-down the search for the desired peak in actual SCG signal. Experimental validation of this approach performed in conventional/controlled supine and realistic/challenging seated conditions, containing over 5600 heart beat cycles shows good performance and robustness of the proposed approach in noisy conditions. Automated measurement of STI in wearable configuration can provide a quantified cardiac health index for long-term monitoring of patients, elderly people at risk and health-enthusiasts.

AB  - Background: Wireless vital parameter continuous monitoring (WVPCM) after discharge is compared to regular monitoring to provide data on the clinical-economic impact of complex patients (CPs) discharged from Internal Medicine Units of Ospedale dei Castelli, Lazio. Primary outcome: Major complications (MC) reduction. Secondary outcomes: Patients who reached discharge criteria within the 7th day from admission; difference in MC incidence at the conclusion of the standard telemonitoring/clinical monitoring phase, 5 and 30 days after discharge; and conditions predisposing to MC occurrence. Methods: Open label randomized controlled trial with wearable wireless system that creates alerts on portable devices. Continuous glycemic monitoring is performed for patients with diabetes mellitus. Results: There were 110 patients enrolled (mean age: 76.2 years). Comorbidity: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS-CI (comorbidities index): 3.93, CIRS SI (severity index): 1.93. About 19% scored a BRASS (Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score) & GE;20 indicating need for discharge planning requiring step-down care. Globally, 48% of patients in the control group had major complications (27 out of 56 patients), in contrast to 22% in the intervention group (12 out of 54 patients). Conclusions: Since WVPCM detects early complications during the post-discharge CPs monitoring, it increases safety and reduces inappropriate access to the Emergency Room, preventing avoidable re-hospitalizations.

AB  - Adulteration of medications is an emerging and significant threat to human health and well-being, even though adulterants are still often not considered seriously in clinical or forensic toxicology. Screening of drug adulterations is a major challenge and concern for regulatory authorities worldwide. Metformin hydro-chloride, an important drug to treat diabetes, is found to be adulterated worldwide and a major reason to worry about the health and safety procedure. We have demonstrated a first-of-a-kind electrochemical biomedical device utilizing exfoliated graphene oxide (GO)-Nafion-modified customized gold screen-printed electrodes (spiral electrochemical notification-coupled electrode, SENCE), driven by electro-chemical adsorptive stripping voltammetry, to identify the trace level adulteration in metformin. The GO-Nafion-SPE interface has been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, and Fourier transform infrared. Custom-made screen-printed SENCEs have been functionalized with GO nanoparticles (transducer) to obtain a fingerprint signal response of metformin using differential pulse voltammetry. A linear calibrated dose response has been obtained with n = 3 repetitions with a low limit of detection of 10 ppm for metformin. We have used the sensing response as a function of adulteration, and it is extensively supported by rigorous statistical analysis along with the help of the machine learning tool. This is a first-of-its-kind IoT-enabled electrochemical sensor and analysis platform that can detect drug adulteration as a low, medium, and high output.

AB  - Objective: Compressed sensing (CS) is a low-complexity compression technology that has recently been proposed. It can be applied to long-term electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring using wearable devices. In this study, an automatic screening method for atrial fibrillation (AF) based on lossy compression of the electrocardiogram signal is proposed.Approach: The proposed method combines the CS with the convolutional neural network (CNN). The sparse binary sensing matrix is first used to project the raw ECG signal randomly, transforming the raw ECG data from high-dimensional space to low-dimensional space to complete compression, and then using CNN to classify the compressed ECG signal involving AF. Our proposed model is validated on the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database.Main results: The experimental results show that the model only needs about 1 s to complete the 24 h ECG recording of AF, which is 3.41%, 69.84% and 67.56% less than the time required by AlexNet, VGGNet and GoogLeNet, respectively. Under different compression ratios of 10% to 90%, the maximum and minimum F1 scores reach 96.25% and 88.17%, respectively.Significance: The CS-CNN (compressed sensing convolutional neural network) model has high computational efficiency while ensuring prediction accuracy, and is a promising method for AF screening in wearable application scenarios.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic certainly has posed one of the more difficult challenges for researchers in the current century. The development of an automatic diagnostic tool, able to detect the disease in its early stage, could undoubtedly offer a great advantage to the battle against the pandemic. In this regard, most of the research efforts have been focused on the application of Deep Learning (DL) techniques to chest images, including traditional chest X-rays (CXRs) and Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Although these approaches have demonstrated their effectiveness in detecting the COVID-19 disease, they are of huge computational complexity and require large datasets for training. In addition, there may not exist a large amount of COVID-19 CXRs and CT scans available to researchers. To this end, in this paper, we propose an approach based on the evaluation of the histogram from a common class of images that is considered as the target. A suitable inter-histogram distance measures how this target histogram is far from the histogram evaluated on a test image: if this distance is greater than a threshold, the test image is labeled as anomaly, i.e., the scan belongs to a patient affected by COVID-19 disease. Extensive experimental results and comparisons with some benchmark state-of-the-art methods support the effectiveness of the developed approach, as well as demonstrate that, at least when the images of the considered datasets are homogeneous enough (i.e., a few outliers are present), it is not really needed to resort to complex-to-implement DL techniques, in order to attain an effective detection of the COVID-19 disease. Despite the simplicity of the proposed approach, all the considered metrics (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure) attain a value of 1.0 under the selected datasets, a result comparable to the corresponding state-of-the-art DNN approaches, but with a remarkable computational simplicity.

AB  - Biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis, prognostication and clinical trial cohort selection are an urgent need. While many promising markers have been discovered through the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) and other mechanisms, no single PD marker or set of markers are ready for clinical use. Here we discuss the current state of biomarker discovery for platforms relevant to PDBP. We discuss the role of the PDBP in PD biomarker identification and present guidelines to facilitate their development. These guidelines include: harmonizing procedures for biofluid acquisition and clinical assessments, replication of the most promising biomarkers, support and encouragement of publications that report negative findings, longitudinal follow-up of current cohorts including the PDBP, testing of wearable technologies to capture readouts between study visits and development of recently diagnosed (de novo) cohorts to foster identification of the earliest markers of disease onset.

AB  - Flexible electronics require elastomeric and conductive biointerfaces with native tissue-like mechanical properties. The conventional approaches to engineer such a biointerface often utilize conductive nanomaterials in combination with polymeric hydrogels that are cross-linked using toxic photoinitiators. Moreover, these systems frequently demonstrate poor biocompatibility and face trade-offs between conductivity and mechanical stiffness under physiological conditions. To address these challenges, we developed a class of shear-thinning hydrogels as biomaterial inks for 3D printing flexible bioelectronics. These hydrogels are engineered through a facile vacancy-driven gelation of MoS2 nanoassemblies with naturally derived polymer-thiolated gelatin. Due to shear-thinning properties, these nanoengineered hydrogels can be printed into complex shapes that can respond to mechanical deformation. The chemically cross-linked nanoengineered hydrogels demonstrate a 20-fold rise in compressive moduli and can withstand up to 80% strain without permanent deformation, meeting human anatomical flexibility. The nanoengineered network exhibits high conductivity, compressive modulus, pseudocapacitance, and biocompatibility. The 3D-printed cross-linked structure demonstrates excellent strain sensitivity and can be used as wearable electronics to detect various motion dynamics. Overall, the results suggest that these nanoengineered hydrogels offer improved mechanical, electronic, and biological characteristics for various emerging biomedical applications including 3D-printed flexible biosensors, actuators, optoelectronics, and therapeutic delivery devices.

AB  - Background: Gait is an essential manifestation of depression. However, the gait characteristics of daily walking and their relationships with depression have yet to be fully explored. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore associations between depression symptom severity and daily-life gait characteristics derived from acceleration signals in real-world settings.Methods: We used two ambulatory data sets (N=71 and N=215) with acceleration signals collected by wearable devices and mobile phones, respectively. We extracted 12 daily-life gait features to describe the distribution and variance of gait cadence and force over a long-term period. Spearman coefficients and linear mixed-effects models were used to explore the associations between daily-life gait features and depression symptom severity measured by the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) and 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) self-reported questionnaires. The likelihood-ratio (LR) test was used to test whether daily-life gait features could provide additional information relative to the laboratory gait features.Results: Higher depression symptom severity was significantly associated with lower gait cadence of high-performance walking (segments with faster walking speed) over a long-term period in both data sets. The linear regression model with long-term daily-life gait features (R2=0.30) fitted depression scores significantly better (LR test P=.001) than the model with only laboratory gait features (R2=0.06).Conclusions: This study indicated that the significant links between daily-life walking characteristics and depression symptom severity could be captured by both wearable devices and mobile phones. The daily-life gait patterns could provide additional information for predicting depression symptom severity relative to laboratory walking. These findings may contribute to developing clinical tools to remotely monitor mental health in real-world settings.

AB  - Background Patients undergoing major surgery are at risk of complications, so-called serious adverse events (SAE). Continuous monitoring may detect deteriorating patients by recording abnormal vital signs. We aimed to assess the association between abnormal vital signs inspired by Early Warning Score thresholds and subsequent SAEs in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. Methods Prospective observational cohort study continuously monitoring heart rate, respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, and blood pressure for up to 96 h in 500 postoperative patients admitted to the general ward. Exposure variables were vital sign abnormalities, primary outcome was any serious adverse event occurring within 30 postoperative days. The primary analysis investigated the association between exposure variables per 24 h and subsequent serious adverse events. Results Serious adverse events occurred in 37% of patients, with 38% occurring during monitoring. Among patients with SAE during monitoring, the median duration of vital sign abnormalities was 272 min (IQR 110-447), compared to 259 min (IQR 153-394) in patients with SAE after monitoring and 261 min (IQR 132-468) in the patients without any SAE (p = .62 for all three group comparisons). Episodes of heart rate >= 110 bpm occurred in 16%, 7.1%, and 3.9% of patients in the time before SAE during monitoring, after monitoring, and without SAE, respectively (p < .002). Patients with SAE after monitoring experienced more episodes of hypotension <= 90 mm Hg/24 h (p = .001). Conclusion Overall duration of vital sign abnormalities at current thresholds were not significantly associated with subsequent serious adverse events, but more patients with tachycardia and hypotension had subsequent serious adverse events.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate if the changes in oxygen saturation levels at intercostal muscles (SmO2 m.intercostales) assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using a wearable device could determine the respiratory compensation point (RCP) during exercise. Fifteen healthy competitive triathletes (eight males; 29 +/- 6 years; height 167.6 +/- 25.6 cm; weight 69.2 +/- 9.4 kg; (V) over dotO(2)-max 58.4 +/- 8.1 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) were evaluated in a cycle ergometer during the maximal oxygen-uptake test ((V) over dotO(2)-max), while lung ventilation ((V) over dotE), power output (watts, W) and SmO2 mantercostales were measured. RCP was determined by visual method (RCPvisual : changes at ventilatory equivalents ((V) over dotE.CO2-1, (V) over dotE.(V) over dotO(2)(-1)) and end-tidal respiratory pressure (PetO(2), PetCO(2)) and NIRS method (RCP NIRS : breakpoint of fall in SmO2 m.intercostales). During exercise, SmO2 m.intercostales decreased continuously showing a higher decrease when (V) over dotE increased abruptly. A good agreement between methods used to determine RCP was found (visual vs NIRS) at %(V) over dotO(2)-max, (V) over dotO(2), (V) over dotE, and W (Bland-Altman test). Correlations were found to each parameters analyzed (r = 0.854; r = 0.865; r = 0.981; and r = 0,968; respectively. p < 0.001 in all variables, Pearson test), with no differences (p < 0.001 in all variables, Student's t-test) between methods used (RCPvisual and RCPNIRS). We concluded that changes at SmO2 m.intercostales measured by NIRS could adequately determine RCP in triathletes.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death, worldwide. To protect those vulnerable to cardiac arrest, defibrillators performing reanimation by automatic discharge are implanted. Due to the high pain intensity of such a procedure, many patients develop anxiety disorders. To diagnose the fear-relevant symptoms, the English version of the Florida Shock Anxiety Scale (FSAS) is used. The present study investigates the quality of the German version of the FSAS using a confirmatory factor analysis. Therefore, a sample of N = 138 participants (n = 38 female and n = 100 male; age: M = 60.99, SD = 11.58) with implanted or wearable cardioverter defibrillators was examined. Similar to the English version, the most suitable model includes the two factors 'consequence' and 'trigger stimulus'. Although, in our investigation, it is not a second order model but a bi-factorial model which reaches the best fit. Both the internal consistency and the convergent validity were checked and showed sufficiently good values. In summary, the German version of the FSAS may also be recommended for the diagnosis of shock-induced anxiety disorder.

AB  - Background: Wearable sensors (wearables) have been commonly integrated into a wide variety of commercial products and are increasingly being used to collect and process raw physiological parameters into salient digital health information. The data collected by wearables are currently being investigated across a broad set of clinical domains and patient populations. There is significant research occurring in the domain of algorithm development, with the aim of translating raw sensor data into fitness- or health-related outcomes of interest for users, patients, and health-care providers.
   Objectives: The aim of this review is to highlight a selected group of fitness- and health-related indicators from wearables data and to describe several algorithmic approaches used to generate these higher order indicators.
   Methods: A systematic search of the PubMed database was performed with the following search terms (number of records in parentheses): Fitbit algorithm (18), Apple Watch algorithm (3), Garmin algorithm (5), Microsoft Band algorithm (8), Samsung Gear algorithm (2), Xiaomi MiBand algorithm (1), Huawei Band (Watch) algorithm (2), photoplethysmography algorithm (465), accelerometry algorithm (966), electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm (8287), and continuous glucose monitor algorithm (343). The search terms chosen for this review are focused on algorithms for wearable devices that dominated the commercial wearables market between 2014 and 2017 and that were highly represented in the biomedical literature. A second set of search terms included categories of algorithms for fitness-related and health-related indicators that are commonly used in wearable devices (e.g. accelerometry, PPG, ECG). These articles covered the following domain areas: fitness; exercise; movement; physical activity; step count; walking; running; swimming; energy expenditure; atrial fibrillation; arrhythmia; cardiovascular; autonomic nervous system; neuropathy; heart rate variability; fall detection; trauma; behavior change; diet; eating; stress detection; serum glucose monitoring; continuous glucose monitoring; diabetes mellitus type 1; and diabetes mellitus type 2. All studies uncovered through this search on commercially available device algorithms and pivotal studies on sensor algorithm development were summarized, and a summary table was constructed using references generated by the literature review as described (Table 1).
   Conclusions: Wearable health technologies aim to collect and process raw physiological or environmental parameters into salient digital health information. Much of the current and future utility of wearables lies in the signal processing steps and algorithms used to analyze large volumes of data. Continued algorithmic development and advances in machine learning techniques will further increase analytic capabilities. In the context of these advances, our review aims to highlight a range of advances in fitness- and other health-related indicators provided by current wearable technologies.

AB  - Background: Research with sexual and gender minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, asexual, trans, non-binary) people of Color (SGM-PoC) has largely focused on risk and negative health outcomes. The existing strengths-based mental health research suggests that identity affirmation may be associated with psychological resilience and good mental health among SGM-PoC, but little is known about predictors of physiological resil-ience and biomarkers of physical health in this population. Adaptive cardiovascular flexibility is an indicator of physiological resilience and physical health in that it enables the body to mobilize resources to adapt to chal-lenges. This study explored the association between identity affirmation and physiological resilience, observed through cardiovascular flexibility in response to stress among SGM-PoC.Methods: Participants were 95 SGM-PoC of varying ethnoracial backgrounds, sexual orientations, and gender identities, residing in Canada. Participants completed questionnaires on sociodemographic and psychosocial variables, including a measure of identity affirmation, the Queer People of Color Identity Affirmation Scale (QPIAS). In a laboratory setting, we induced stress using the Trier Social Stress Test and measured heart rate variability (HRV) over time using wearable electrocardiogram devices.Results: Results from multilevel modeling analyses revealed that high QPIAS scores were associated with adaptive cardiovascular flexibility, as evidenced by reduced HRV during stress exposure, followed by HRV increase during recovery. As QPIAS scores increased, the shape of HRV trajectory increasingly reflected our predicted pattern of adaptive cardiovascular flexibility. Meanwhile, low QPIAS scores were not associated with this pattern and appeared to predict a more flatlined HRV activity during the experiment.Conclusions: Findings indicate that Queer People of Color identity affirmation may be related to physiological resilience, observed through a more adaptive cardiovascular profile when responding to stress. Identity affir-mation may thus be a protective factor for SGM-PoC, pointing to the critical importance of affirming resources and strengths-based health research.

AB  - Severe injuries of lower extremities often lead to chronic pain and reduced walking abilities. We postulated that measuring free-living gait can provide further information about walking ability in complement to clinical evaluations. We sought to validate a method that characterizes free gaits with a wearable sensor. Over one week, 81 healthy controls (HC) and 66 chronic lower limb pain patients (CLLPP) hospitalized for multidisciplinary rehabilitation wore a simple accelerometer (Actigraph). In the acceleration signals, steady 1-min walks detected numbered 7,835 (5,085 in CLLPP and 2,750 in HC). Five gait quality measures were assessed: movement intensity, cadence, stride regularity, and short-term and long-term local dynamic stability. Gait quality variables differed significantly between CLLPP and HC (4%-26%). Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed moderate to high repeatability (0.71-0.91), which suggests that seven days of measurement are sufficient to assess average gait patterns. Regression analyses showed significant association (R-2 = 0.44) between the gait quality variables and a clinical evaluation of walking ability, i.e., the 6-min walk test. Overall, the results show that the method is easy to implement, valid (high concurrent validity), and reliable to assess walking abilities ecologically.

AB  - Racism-related stress is thought to contribute to widespread race/ ethnic health inequities via negative emotion and allostatic stress process up-regulation. Although prior studies document race related stress and health correlations, due to methodological and technical limitations, they have been unable to directly test the stress-reactivity hypothesis in situ. Guided by theories of constructed emotion and allostasis, we developed a protocol using wearable sensors and daily surveys that allowed us to operationalize and time-couple self-reported racism-related experiences, negative emotions, and an independent biosignal of emotional arousal. We used data from 100 diverse young adults at a predominantly White college campus to assess racism-related stress reactivity using electrodermal activity (EDA), a biosignal of sympathetic nervous system activity. We find that racism-related experiences predict both increased negative emotion risk and heightened EDA, consistent with the proposed allostatic model of health and disease. Specific patterns varied across race/ethnic groups. For example, discrimination and rumination were associated with negative emotion for African American students, but only interpersonal discrimination predicted increased arousal via EDA. The pattern of results was more general for Latinx students, for whom interpersonal discrimination, vicarious racism exposure, and rumination significantly modulated arousal. As with Latinx students, African students were particularly responsive to vicarious racism while 1.5 generation Black students were generally not responsive to racism-related experiences. Overall, these findings provide support for allo stasis-based theories of mental and physical health via a naturalistic assessment of the emotional and sympathetic nervous system responding to real-life social experiences.

KW  - WiFi
AB  - Tracking human sleeping postures and vital signs of breathing and heart rates during sleep is important as it can help to assess the general physical health of a person and provide useful clues for diagnosing possible diseases. Traditional approaches (e.g., polysomnography) are limited to clinic usage. Recent radio frequency-based approaches require specialized devices or dedicated wireless sensors and are only able to track breathing rate. In this paper, we propose to track the vital signs of both breathing rate and heart rate during sleep by using off-the-shelf WiFi without any wearable or dedicated devices. Our system reuses existing WiFi network and exploits the fine-grained channel information to capture the minute movements caused by breathing and heart beats. Our system thus has the potential to be widely deployed and perform continuous long-term monitoring. The developed algorithm makes use of the channel information in both time and frequency domain to estimate breathing and heart rates, and it works well when either individual or two persons are in bed. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can accurately capture vital signs during sleep under realistic settings, and achieve comparable or even better performance comparing to traditional and existing approaches, which is a strong indication of providing noninvasive, continuous fine-grained vital signs monitoring without any additional cost.

AB  - Patients show subtle changes in daily behavioral patterns, revealed by traditional assessments (e.g., performance- or questionnaire-based assessments) even in the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD; i.e., the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage). An increase in studies on the assessment of daily behavioral changes in patients with MCI and AD using digital technologies (e.g., wearable and nonwearable sensor-based assessment) has been noted in recent years. In addition, more objective, quantitative, and realistic evidence of altered daily behavioral patterns in patients with MCI and AD has been provided by digital technologies rather than traditional assessments. Therefore, this study hypothesized that the assessment of daily behavioral changes with digital technologies can replace or assist traditional assessment methods for early MCI and AD detection. In this review, we focused on research using nonwearable sensor-based in-home assessment. Previous studies on the assessment of behavioral changes in MCI and AD using traditional performance- or questionnaire-based assessments are first described. Next, an overview of previous studies on the assessment of behavioral changes in MCI and AD using nonwearable sensor-based in-home assessment is provided. Finally, the usefulness and problems of nonwearable sensor-based in-home assessment for early MCI and AD detection are discussed. In conclusion, this review stresses that subtle changes in daily behavioral patterns detected by nonwearable sensor-based in-home assessment can be early MCI and AD biomarkers.

AB  - Background: ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have showed activity and efficacy in ROS1-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the clinical practice, besides the utilization of crizotinib, less is known about the best treatment strategies involving additional, new-generation TKIs for the sequential treatment of ROS1-positive NSCLC patients.
   Case Presentation: A patient suffering from a ROS1-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma, after receiving cisplatin-pemetrexed chemotherapy, was treated with entrectinib, a newgeneration ALK/ROS1/NTRK inhibitor. After 16 months, central nervous system (CNS) metastases appeared, without extra-cerebral disease progression. Stereotactic brain radio-therapy was performed and entrectinib was maintained, due to the global systemic disease control. Approximately one month after radiotherapy, thoracic and meningeal progressions were detected, the latter highly symptomatic with neurocognitive disorders, visual hallucinations and worsening of psycho-motor impairment. A lumbar puncture was positive for tumor cells and for an EZR-ROS1 fusion. The administration of lorlatinib (a third-generation ALK/ROS1 inhibitor) prompted an extremely rapid improvement of clinical conditions, anticipating the positive results observed at radiologic evaluation that confirmed the disease response still ongoing after nine months since treatment start.
   Discussion: With the expanding availability of targeted agents with differential activity on resistance mechanism and on CNS disease, choosing wisely the best treatment strategies is pivotal to assure the best clinical outcomes in oncogene-addicted NSCLC patients. Here we have reported lorlatinib reverted an almost fatal meningeal carcinomatosis developing during entrectinib in a ROS1-positive NSCLC patient.

AB  - Today there is considerable interest for making use of the latest technological advancements for several healthcare applications. However, there are several challenges for making use of different technologies for healthcare applications. In particular, there is a need to ensure that the healthcare related services receive priority during events, such as legitimate failures of devices, congestion, and attacks in the networks. In this paper, we discuss some of the requirements for making use of technology for healthcare applications and propose techniques for secure monitoring of patients with wandering behavior in a hospital or elderly care environment. One of the aims of our work is to use technology for secure monitoring of patients with wandering behavior to keep them away from danger, or detect if the behavior of the patient violates the policies of the hospital, or even violates privacy policies of other patients. Our approach makes use of software defined networking (SDN), Wireless LAN (WLAN), and wearable devices for the patients. Our approach incurs low cost since WLAN is widely deployed. However, there are some challenges for making use of WLAN for monitoring dementia patients, since it is primarily used for accessing the Internet and its open nature is vulnerable to different types of security attacks. Hence we make use of SDN to solve some of these challenges and provide priority for the monitoring services. We have developed a security application for an SDN controller that can be used to enforce fine granular policies for communication between the hosts, real time location tracking of the patients, and deal with attacks on the hospital networks. The policy-based security enforcement helps to differentiate healthcare related traffic from other traffic and provide priority to the healthcare traffic. The real time location tracking detects wandering by patients and if necessary can raise alarms to the staff. The attack detection component makes use of attack signatures and behavior-based intrusion detection to deal with attacks on hospital networks. We will also present the prototype implementation of our model using ONOS SDN controller and OpenFlow Access Points.Y

AB  - Background Telemonitoring of circadian and sleep cycles could identify shift workers at increased risk of poor health, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, thus supporting personalized prevention.
   Methods The Circadiem cross-sectional study aimed at determining early warning signals of risk of health alteration in hospital nightshifters (NS) versus dayshifters (DS, alternating morning and afternoon shifts). Circadian rhythmicity in activity, sleep, and temperature was telemonitored on work and free days for one week. Participants wore a bluetooth low energy thoracic accelerometry and temperature sensor that was wirelessly connected to a GPRS gateway and a health data hub server. Hidden Markov modelling of activity quantified Rhythm Index, rest quality (probability, p1-1, of remaining at rest), and rest duration. Spectral analyses determined periods in body surface temperature and accelerometry. Parameters were compared and predictors of circadian and sleep disruption were identified by multivariate analyses using information criteria-based model selection. Clusters of individual shift work response profiles were recognized.
   Findings Of 140 per-protocol participants (133 females), there were 63 NS and 77 DS. Both groups had similar median rest amount, yet NS had significantly worse median rest-activity Rhythm Index (0.38 [IQR, 0.29-0.47] vs. 0.69 [0.60-0.77], p<0.0001) and rest quality p1-1 (0.94 [0.94-0.95] vs 0.96 [0.94-0.97], p<0.0001) over the whole study week. Only 48% of the NS displayed a circadian period in temperature, as compared to 70% of the DS (p=0.026). Poor p1-1 was associated with nightshift work on both work (p<0.0001) and free days (p=0.0098). The number of years of past night work exposure predicted poor rest-activity Rhythm Index jointly with shift type, age and chronotype on workdays (p= 0.0074), and singly on free days (p=0.0005).
   Interpretation A dedicated analysis toolbox of streamed data from a wearable device identified circadian and sleep rhythm markers, that constitute surrogate candidate endpoints of poor health risk in shift-workers.

AB  - This paper is designed to study the acceptance of the Internet of Things (IoT) in Industry (so-called Industry Internet of Things, shortly IIoT) and the necessities for higher education in the period of the fourth industrial revolt. The accumulation of the fourth letter, "P" in face of the "IoT" coins the name of the novel idea, "IIoT" in next of kin with another term, "Industry 4.0". Because these ideas have no specific and broadly conventional definitions, we offered some well thought-out significant by scientific literature. The paper also draws attention to the most significant similarities and differences between these ideas. PIoT is a very self-motivated idea and it will continually bring revolutionizes in digital technologies, necessities and markets, and will also renovate industries and Industry practices. According to various studies, presently, there is a proficiency gap which may amplify in the future if no stroke is taken. Higher education must approve the most recent associated technologies and must get used to to the novel ways in which people, machines, services and information can interrelate. As a result, employees, students, graduates, etc. have to be uniformly vibrant in learning and obtaining novel skills. The evolution from higher education to service is a challenge that could be further simply addressed during the hard work of all stakeholders, from individuals to organizations, and from industries to governments. As revolutionize in higher education take time, every stakeholders will now have to be active in getting ready for the Industry Internet of Things.

AB  - We envision unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for rapid evacuation of critically-ill patients from hazardous locations to health care facilities in safe zones. For safety, medical teams accompany patients to monitor vital signs and titrate anesthesia dose during transport. UAV transports would require continuous automated remote monitoring of both vital signs and of sedative dose to be feasible and safe. Volatile anesthetics (isoflurane) are the only anesthetic agents that can be monitored continuously with infrared spectroscopy (IR) devices; but unsuitable for transport. Our objective is to devise a safe UAV transport protocol incorporating novel technology for gas monitoring. Our group has developed and tested a miniaturized wearable fuel cell sensor that can detect isoflurane gas vapors as low as 40 ppm (within therapeutic range) with a sensitivity of 0.0112 nA ppm(-1) cm(-2). Ambient signal interference was resolved by principal component analysis (PCA). Data variance of 1st and 2nd principal components was 88.68% and 11.31%, respectively. The PCA regression model reported here can determine accurate Isoflurane concentrations. Electronic IoT platform has been built constituting micro-fuel cell, miniaturized electronic components with Bluetooth. This wearable sensor can be incorporated into a comprehensive life support system for casualty evacuation in conjunction with autonomous UAV emergency medical operations. (C) The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Objectives We investigated machinelearningbased identification of presymptomatic COVID-19 and detection of infection-related changes in physiology using a wearable device. Design Interim analysis of a prospective cohort study. Setting, participants and interventions Participants from a national cohort study in Liechtenstein were included. Nightly they wore the Ava-bracelet that measured respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), wrist-skin temperature (WST) and skin perfusion. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed by molecular and/or serological assays. Results A total of 1.5 million hours of physiological data were recorded from 1163 participants (mean age 44 +/- 5.5 years). COVID-19 was confirmed in 127 participants of which, 66 (52%) had worn their device from baseline to symptom onset (SO) and were included in this analysis. Multi-level modelling revealed significant changes in five (RR, HR, HRV, HRV ratio and WST) device-measured physiological parameters during the incubation, presymptomatic, symptomatic and recovery periods of COVID-19 compared with baseline. The training set represented an 8-day long instance extracted from day 10 to day 2 before SO. The training set consisted of 40 days measurements from 66 participants. Based on a random split, the test set included 30% of participants and 70% were selected for the training set. The developed long short-term memory (LSTM) based recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithm had a recall (sensitivity) of 0.73 in the training set and 0.68 in the testing set when detecting COVID-19 up to 2 days prior to SO. Conclusion Wearable sensor technology can enable COVID-19 detection during the presymptomatic period. Our proposed RNN algorithm identified 68% of COVID-19 positive participants 2 days prior to SO and will be further trained and validated in a randomised, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial.

AB  - Comprehensive monitoring of performance is essential for swimmers and swimming coaches to optimize the training. Regardless of the swimming technique, the swimmer passes various swimming phases from wall to wall, including a dive into the water or wall push-off, then glide and strokes preparation and finally, swimming up to the turn. The coach focuses on improving the performance of the swimmer in each of these phases. The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of using a sacrum-worn inertial measurement unit (IMU) for performance evaluation in each swimming phase (wall push-off, glide, stroke preparation and swimming) of elite swimmers in four main swimming techniques (i.e. front crawl, breaststroke, butterfly and backstroke). Nineteen swimmers were asked to wear a sacrum IMU and swim four one-way 25 m trials in each technique, attached to a tethered speedometer and filmed by cameras in the whole lap as reference systems. Based on the literature, several goal metrics were extracted from the instantaneous velocity (e.g. average velocity per stroke cycle) and displacement (e.g. time to reach 15 m from the wall) data from a tethered speedometer for the swimming phases, each one representing the goodness of swimmer's performance. Following a novel approach, that starts from swimming bout detection and continues until detecting the swimming phases, the IMU kinematic variables in each swimming phase were extracted. The highly associated variables with the corresponding goal metrics were detected by LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) variable selection and used for estimating the goal metrics with a linear regression model. The selected kinematic variables were relevant to the motion characteristics of each phase (e.g. selection of propulsion-related variables in wall push-off phase), providing more interpretability to the model. The estimation reached a determination coefficient (R-2) value more than 0.75 and a relative RMSE less than 10% for most goal metrics in all swimming techniques. The results show that a single sacrum IMU can provide a wide range of performance-related swimming kinematic variables, useful for performance evaluation in four main swimming techniques.

AB  - Heart disease is one of the top ten threats to global health in 2019 according to the WHO. Continuous monitoring of ECG on wearable devices can detect abnormality in the user's heartbeat early, thereby significantly increasing the chance of early intervention which is known to be the key to saving lives. In this paper, we present a set of inter-patient ECG classification methods that use convolutional (CNNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). We focused on inter-patient heartbeat classification, in which the model is trained over several patients and then used to infer that for patients not used in training. Raw heartbeat data is used in this paper because most wearable devices cannot deal with complex data preprocessing. A two-steps convolutional neural network testing method is proposed for saving power. For even greater energy-saving, a spiking neural network is also proposed. The latter is obtained from converting the trained CNN model with a less than one percent accuracy drop. The average power of a two-classes SNN is 0.077 W, or 0.0074x that of previously proposed neural network-based solutions.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and intermittent making its detection challenging. A photoplethysmography (PPG) provides a promising option for atrial fibrillation detection. However, the shapes of pulse waves vary in atrial fibrillation decreasing pulse and atrial fibrillation detection accuracy. This study evaluated ten robust photoplethysmography features for detection of atrial fibrillation. The study was a national multi-center clinical study in Finland and the data were combined from two broader research projects (NCT03721601, URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03721601 and NCT03753139, URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03753139). A photoplethysmography signal was recorded with a wrist band. Five pulse interval variability, four amplitude features and a novel autocorrelation-based morphology feature were calculated and evaluated independently as predictors of atrial fibrillation. A multivariate predictor model including only the most significant features was established. The models were 10-fold cross-validated. 359 patients were included in the study (atrial fibrillation n = 169, sinus rhythm n = 190). The autocorrelation univariate predictor model detected atrial fibrillation with the highest area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.982 (sensitivity 95.1%, specificity 93.7%). Autocorrelation was also the most significant individual feature (p < 0.00001) in the multivariate predictor model, detecting atrial fibrillation with AUC of 0.993 (sensitivity 96.4%, specificity 96.3%). Our results demonstrated that the autocorrelation independently detects atrial fibrillation reliably without the need of pulse detection. Combining pulse wave morphology-based features such as autocorrelation with information from pulse-interval variability it is possible to detect atrial fibrillation with high accuracy with a commercial wrist band. Photoplethysmography wrist bands accompanied with atrial fibrillation detection algorithms utilizing autocorrelation could provide a computationally very effective and reliable wearable monitoring method in screening of atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Watching the elderly is one of promising IoT applications in the field of nursing care. Humanoid robots are considered to be useful agents for not only relaxing the elderly but also watching and alerting them in a daily life. Detecting and preventing the risk of indoor heat stroke is an important issue especially for the elderly who live alone. A method for reliably conveying the possible danger of the indoor heat stroke to the elderly is a crucial factor to implement a practical system. In this paper, we describe the system for detecting possible risk of suffering from the indoor heat stroke and informing the detected state to the elderly by using a communication robot. While the robot normally gives users healing, the proposed system implements a method for certainly notifying the abnormal conditions to the elderly by using robot motions. Because designing natural robot motions is a difficult task even for skilled engineers, we also devise a method to easily creating new robot motions by imitating human body gestures. We design a set of normal and special motions for a desktop humanoid robot and evaluated whether the robot motions can effectively make users aware of abnormal situations. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Dementia is a global epidemic and incurs substantial burden on the affected families and the health care system. A window of opportunity for intervention is the predementia stage known as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Individuals often present to services late in the course of their disease and more needs to be done for early detection; sensor technology is a potential method for detection.
   Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing sensors in the homes of senior citizens to detect changes in behaviors unobtrusively.
   Methods: We recruited 59 community-dwelling seniors (aged >65 years who live alone) with and without MCI and observed them over the course of 2 months. The frequency of forgetfulness was monitored by tagging personal items and tracking missed doses of medication. Activities such as step count, time spent away from home, television use, sleep duration, and quality were tracked with passive infrared motion sensors, smart plugs, bed sensors, and a wearable activity band. Measures of cognition, depression, sleep, and social connectedness were also administered.
   Results: Of the 49 participants who completed the study, 28 had MCI and 21 had healthy cognition (HC). Frequencies of various sensor-derived behavior metrics were computed and compared between MCI and HC groups. MCI participants were less active than their HC counterparts and had more sleep interruptions per night. MCI participants had forgotten their medications more times per month compared with HC participants. The sensor system was acceptable to over 80% (40/49) of study participants, with many requesting for permanent installation of the system.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that it was both feasible and acceptable to set up these sensors in the community and unobtrusively collect data. Further studies evaluating such digital biomarkers in the homes in the community are needed to improve the ecological validity of sensor technology. We need to refine the system to yield more clinically impactful information.

AB  - Neuromuscular electrical stimulation has been used to treat cardiovascular diseases and other types of muscular dysfunction. A novel whole-body neuromuscular electrical stimulation (WB-NMES) wearable device may be beneficial when combined with voluntary exercises. This study aimed to investigate the safety and effects of the WB-NMES on hemodynamics, arrhythmia, and sublingual microcirculation. The study included 19 healthy Japanese volunteers, aged 22-33 years, who were not using any medication. Electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiography, and blood sampling were conducted before a 20-min WB-NMES session and at 0 and 10 min after termination of WB-NMES. Their tolerable maximum intensity was recorded using numeric rating scale. Arrhythmia was not detected during neuromuscular electrical stimulation or during 10 min of recovery. Blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular ejection fraction, and diastolic function remained unchanged; however, mild mitral regurgitation was transiently observed during WB-NMES in a single male participant. A decrease in blood glucose and an increase in blood lactate levels were observed, but no changes in blood fluidity, sublingual microcirculation, blood levels of noradrenaline, or oxidative stress were shown. WB-NMES is safe and effective for decreasing blood glucose and increasing blood lactate levels without changing the blood fluidity or microcirculation in healthy people.

AB  - Background: Today, the main challenge for researchers is to develop new technologies which may help to improve the diagnoses of cardiovascular disease (CVD), thereby reducing healthcare costs and improving the quality of life for patients. This study aims to show the utility of biomedical shirt-based electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring of patients with CVD in different clinical situations using the Nuubo (R) ECG (nECG) system.
   Methods: An investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective observational study was carried out in a cardiology (adult and pediatric) and cardiac rehabilitation wards. ECG monitoring was used with the biomedical shirt in the following four independent groups of patients: 1) 30 patients after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), 2) 30 cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) recipients, 3) 120 patients during cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction, and 4) 40 pediatric patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) before electrophysiology study. Approval for all study groups was obtained from the institutional review board. The biomedical shirt captures the electrocardiographic signal via textile electrodes integrated into a garment. The software allows the visualization and analysis of data such as ECG, heart rate, arrhythmia detecting algorithm and relative position of the body is captured by an electronic device.
   Discussion: The major advantages of the nECG system are continuous ECG monitoring during daily activities, high quality of ECG recordings, as well as assurance of a proper adherence due to adequate comfort while wearing the shirt. There are only a few studies that have examined wearable systems, especially in pediatric populations.

KW  - HEALTH
AB  - Currently, the shortage of care workers for the elderly has become a big problem, and more streamlined care operations are needed. In care facilities, care workers are required to use their subjective experience to detect anomalies in physical condition of care receivers, including serious or insignificant deterioration or behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, which can decrease the work efficiency. Therefore, we aim to create a model using objective data for detecting anomalies in physical condition. In this study, data from 13 subjects in a care facility were collected, and isolation forest models were constructed for each subject. The subject's anomalies in physical condition were documented in a care record by a nurse and used as reference for model evaluation. Recall and specificity were used to evaluate the model, expressed as the percentage of detection success for abnormal or normal conditions. Data collected for 1 to 60 days were used to train the isolation models, and the relationship between the amount of training data and model performance was simulated. Heart rate, respiratory rate, and time of getting out of bed were collected from a sensor placed on the subject's bed and used as the model features. In addition, dietary intake information was collected from the care record. Analysis of the evaluation results showed recall and specificity of 45.6 +/- 46.7% and 83.88 +/- 6.06%, respectively, for the model constructed using training data of 60 days. For future studies, we will continue to collect data and increase the number of participants to improve the robustness and accuracy of the proposed anomaly detection system.

AB  - In this paper we present a methodology for recognizing three fundamental movements of the human forearm (extension, flexion and rotation) using pattern recognition applied to the data from a single wrist-worn, inertial sensor. We propose that this technique could be used as a clinical tool to assess rehabilitation progress in neurodegenerative pathologies such as stroke or cerebral palsy by tracking the number of times a patient performs specific arm movements (e.g. prescribed exercises) with their paretic arm throughout the day. We demonstrate this with healthy subjects and stroke patients in a simple proof of concept study in which these arm movements are detected during an archetypal activity of daily-living (ADL) - 'making-a-cup-of-tea'. Data is collected from a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope located proximal to the wrist. In a training phase, movements are initially performed in a controlled environment which are represented by a ranked set of 30 time-domain features. Using a sequential forward selection technique, for each set of feature combinations three clusters are formed using k-means clustering followed by 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation on the training data to determine the best feature combinations. For the testing phase, movements performed during the ADL are associated with each cluster label using a minimum distance classifier in a multi-dimensional feature space, comprised of the best ranked features, using Euclidean or Mahalanobis distance as the metric. Experiments were performed with four healthy subjects and four stroke survivors and our results show that the proposed methodology can detect the three movements performed during the ADL with an overall average accuracy of 88% using the accelerometer data and 83% using the gyroscope data across all healthy subjects and arm movement types. The average accuracy across all stroke survivors was 70% using accelerometer data and 66% using gyroscope data. We also use a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier in association with the same set of features to detect the three arm movements and compare the results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

AB  - This article presents a novel design of portable planar microwave sensor for fast, accurate, and non-invasive monitoring of the blood glucose level as an effective technique for diabetes control and prevention. The proposed sensor design incorporates four cells of hexagonal-shaped complementary split ring resonators (CSRRs), arranged in a honey-cell configuration, and fabricated on a thin sheet of an FR4 dielectric substrate.The CSRR sensing elements are coupled via a planar microstrip-line to a radar board operating in the ISM band 2.4-2.5 GHz. The integrated sensor shows an impressive detection capability and a remarkable sensitivity of blood glucose levels (BGLs). The superior detection capability is attributed to the enhanced design of the CSRR sensing elements that expose the glucose samples to an intense interaction with the electromagnetic fields highly concentrated around the sensing region at the induced resonances. This feature enables the developed sensor to detect extremely delicate variations in the electromagnetic properties that characterize the varying-level glucose samples. The desired performance of the fabricated sensor is practically validated through in-vitro measurements using a convenient setup of Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) that records notable traces of frequency-shift responses when the sensor is loaded with samples of 70-120 mg/dL glucose concentrations. This is also demonstrated in the radar-driven prototype where the raw data collected at the radar receiving channel shows obvious patterns that reflect glucose-level variations. Furthermore, the differences in the sensor responses for tested glucose samples are quantified by applying the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) machine learning algorithm. The proposed sensor, beside its impressive detection capability of the diabetes-spectrum glucose levels, has several other favorable attributes including compact size, simple fabrication, affordable cost, non-ionizing nature, and minimum health risk or impact. Such attractive features promote the proposed sensor as a possible candidate for non-invasive glucose levels monitoring for diabetes as evidenced by the preliminary results from a proof-of-concept in-vivo experiment of tracking an individual's BGL by placing his fingertip onto the sensor. The presented system is a developmental platform towards radar-driven wearable continuous BGL monitors.

AB  - Continuous health monitoring through sensitive physiological signals (using a wearable device) is crucial for the early detection of heart diseases and breathing problems. Here, we have developed a flexible hBN/cotton hybrid device that can detect minor signals such as heartbeat and breathed-out air pressure. Systematic observation of the real-time motion sensing showed a peak-to-peak voltage output of similar to 1.5 V for each heart rate pulse. The as-fabricated device showed a high voltage output of up to similar to 10 V upon applying a pressure of similar to 3 MPa. The FTIR results and DFT calculation suggested a chemical interaction between hBN and cellulose, giving rise to flat band characteristics and partially filled sigma-bonding (sp(2)) hybridization. The atomic-scale chemical interface between atomically thin hBN and surface functional groups present on cotton resulted in charge localization and enhanced output voltage. An hBN/cotton hybrid device can bring new insights and opportunities to develop a self-charging and health-monitoring energy-harvesting cloth.

AB  - Wound infections with antibiotic-resistant bacteria,particularlythe Gram-negative strains, pose a substantial health risk for patientswith limited treatment options. Recently topical administration ofgaseous ozone and its combination with antibiotics through portablesystems has been demonstrated to be a promising approach to eradicatecommonly found Gram-negative strains of bacteria in wound infections.However, despite the significant impact of ozone in treating the growingnumber of antibiotic-resistant infections, uncontrolled and high concentrationsof ozone can cause damage to the surrounding tissue. Hence, beforesuch treatments could advance into clinical usage, it is paramountto identify appropriate levels of topical ozone that are effectivein treating bacterial infections and safe for use in topical administration.To address this concern, we have conducted a series of in vivo studiesto evaluate the efficacy and safety of a portable and wearable adjunctozone and antibiotic wound therapy system. The concurrent ozone andantibiotics are applied through a wound interfaced gas permeable dressingcoated with water-soluble nanofibers containing vancomycin and linezolid(traditionally used to treat Gram-positive infections) and connectedto a portable ozone delivery system. The bactericidal properties ofthe combination therapy were evaluated on an ex vivo wound model infectedwith Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a commonGram-negative strain of bacteria found in many skin infections withhigh resistance to a wide range of currently available antibiotics.The results indicated that the optimized combination delivery of ozone(4 mg h(-1)) and topical antibiotic (200 mu gcm(-2)) provided complete bacteria eradication after6 h of treatment while having minimum cytotoxicity to human fibroblastcells. Furthermore, in vivo local and systemic toxicity studies (e.g.,skin monitoring, skin histopathology, and blood analysis) on pig modelsshowed no signs of adverse effects of ozone and antibiotic combinationtherapy even after 5 days of continuous administration. The confirmedefficacy and biosafety profile of the adjunct ozone and antibiotictherapy places it as a strong candidate for treating wound infectionwith antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and further pursuing human clinicaltrials.

AB  - Context: Early detection of cardiovascular disease could make a difference in terms of treatment success. For that reason, it is important to test the reliability of tools used to deliver diagnoses and to measure the impact of external factors such as stressful situations on alterations in the data collected. Students are an interesting cohort for investigating the effects of stressful situations, as they have a variable number of stress-causing situations in their daily activity over a short period of time.
   Basic procedure: This investigation used 50 students, each of whom underwent two 21-h tests involving the measurement of heart rate in beats per minute while they were carrying out their normal daily activities with their own tools. In this case study, we measured the impact of stressful situations with a tool for the self-diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, using data from students on holiday and during their final exams. We asked the students to select two days on which to use the device and perform the test. The requirements for the days were given to them as follows: for the first test, the students were required to select a day off when their main activity was rest; for the second test, the students were required to select a day in their final exams week that they expected to be the hardest day with the most stressful situations. This paper describes a case study in which we measured the impact of stressful situations with the students' own tools for the self-diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, using data from students on holiday and during their final exams week. These two datasets, as well as the results of the diagnosis, were compared.
   Main findings: The analysis of the data showed that if the students were healthy, some cardiovascular conditions could change, and some tendencies could be found in the data, unrelated to stress. The addition of stressful situations does not have a direct impact on the diagnosis. Thus, we can assume that analysing the data with this methodology and technology will give us an accurate result independent of a person's activities during the test.
   Conclusions: In this sense, and taking into account that the diagnosis was the same in both cases for all the students, we can say that stressful situations don't modify cardiac dynamics, and the diagnosis is useful in all situations. For that reason, the tool is reliable enough to estimate the cardiovascular health of a patient while he or she performs various daily activities by taking advantage of smartphones, commercial heart rate sensors, and IoT platforms.

AB  - Objective: The Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL; CYBERDYNE, Inc., Japan) is a wearable robot device that provides effective gait assistance according to voluntary intention by detecting weak bioelectrical signals of neuromuscular activity on the surface of the skin. We used HAL for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to determine whether HAL training had an effect on their gait ability. Methods: We conducted a single-center, single-arm, observational study. Patients with ALS underwent HAL training once per day (20-40 min per session) for 9-10 days for at least 4 weeks. Gait ability was evaluated using the 2-minute walk test, the 10-meter walk test without the assistance of HAL, and activities of daily living (ADL) using the Barthel Index and Functional Independence Measures before and after a full course of HAL training. Results: There were no dropouts or adverse events during the observation period. Gait function improved after HAL training. The 2-minute walk test revealed a mean gait distance of 73.87 m (36.65) at baseline and 89.9m (36.70) after HAL training (p = 0.004). The 10-meter walk test showed significantly improved cadence, although gait speed, step length on the 10-m walk, or ADL measurements did not change significantly. Conclusions: Although HAL is not a curative treatment for ALS, our data suggest that HAL may be effective in ameliorating and preserving gait ability in patients with ALS.

AB  - This work involves designing an antenna that meets the requirements of radar systems. The associated technology, which was for a long time reserved for the military field, is now available in the civil field, as well as in the biomedical sector for the development of "monitoring" systems allowing to monitor the state of health of a patient in a non-invasive way. The goal of this article is to design a wearable textile antenna to detect cancerous tumors of a patient without direct contact with the skin taking into account the electromagnetic waves directed towards the human body due to the difference between the dielectric constants of healthy and unhealthy tissues. Here we present a miniature AMC antenna of rectangular shape that satisfies the UWB characteristics in terms of bandwidth and reflection coefficient. The proposed AMC antenna operates in X-frequency band (8-12 GHz). Using a model of dielectric artificial skin, we have simulated the specific absorption rate on the human body in order to better respect the FCC standards allowed 1.6 W/kg averaged to 1 g of human tissue.

AB  - We investigated the dynamic properties of the organism state fluctuations along individual aging trajectories in a large longitudinal database of CBC measurements from a consumer diagnostics laboratory. To simplify the analysis, we used a log-linear mortality estimate from the CBC variables as a single quantitative measure of the aging process, henceforth referred to as dynamic organism state indicator (DOSI). We observed, that the age-dependent population DOSI distribution broadening could be explained by a progressive loss of physiological resilience measured by the DOSI auto-correlation time. Extrapolation of this trend suggested that DOSI recovery time and variance would simultaneously diverge at a critical point of 120-150 years of age corresponding to a complete loss of resilience. The observation was immediately confirmed by the independent analysis of correlation properties of intraday physical activity levels fluctuations collected by wearable devices. We conclude that the criticality resulting in the end of life is an intrinsic biological property of an organism that is independent of stress factors and signifies a fundamental or absolute limit of human lifespan. Aging is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases and functional decline. Here, the authors investigate the fluctuations of physiological indices along aging trajectories and observed a characteristic decrease in the organism state recovery rate.

AB  - Background: Although metabolic syndrome (MS) is a typical condition of middle-aged/older person, the association between MS and mortality risk has not been confirmed in people over 65 years. We hypothesized that while in the elderly MS phenotype might lose its value in predicting mortality risk, the two core factors of MS, i.e. insulin resistance (IR) and low grade systemic inflammation (LGSI) would not.
   Methods: 1011 community-dwelling older individuals (InCHIANTI study) were included. MS phenotype was defined by NCEP-ATP-III criteria. IR was calculated by HOMA; high-sensitivity C reactive protein was measured by ELISA. Subjects were divided into four groups based on presence/absence of IR (HOMA >= 2.27) and LGSI (hs-CRP >= 3 g/L): Group 1: no IR/LGSI (reference); Group 2: LGSI only; Group 3: IR only; Group 4: IR + LGSI. Hazard Ratios (HR) for 9-years cardiovascular (CVD) and total mortality, according to IR/LGSI groups, were estimated in subjects with (n. 311) and without MS by Cox model.
   Results: 31.8% of subjects with MS phenotype had no IR, 45.3% had no LGSI; moreover, 51% of subjects with both IR and LGSI didn't display the MS phenotype. MS phenotype was not associated with CVD (HR: 1.29; 95% C. I.: 0.92-1.81) or total (HR: 1.07; 95% C. I.: 0.86-1.34) mortality risk, whereas the presence of IR plus LGSI was associated with increased CVD (no MS: HR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.12-3.72; MS: HR 9.88, 95% CI: 2.18 -4), and overall (no MS: HR 1.72, 95% CI: 1.001-3.17; MS: HR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.02-2.28) mortality risk. The presence of IR (HR: 6.90, 95% CI: 1.45-32) or LGSI (HR 7.56, 95% CI: 1.63-35) was associated with CVD mortality, only among individuals with MS phenotype.
   Conclusions: Among community-dwelling older individuals, IR and LGSI, but not MS phenotype, was associated with 9-years overall and CVD mortality risk. Since a reduced "overlap" between MS phenotype and its physiopathological core (IR and LGSI) might be present with aging, we suggest that the definition of MS might be more holistic in advanced age, and probably comprise the measurement of IR and LGSI.

AB  - Wearable exoskeletons play an important role in people's lives, such as helping stroke and amputation patients to carry out rehabilitation training and so on. How to make the exoskeleton accurately judge the human action intention is the basic requirement to ensure that it can complete the corresponding task. Traditional exoskeleton control signals include pressure values, joint angles and acceleration values, which can only reflect the current motion information of the human lower limbs and cannot be used to predict motion. The electromyography (EMG) signal always occurs before a certain movement; it can be used to predict the target's gait speed and movement as the input signal. In this study, the generalization ability of a BP neural network and the timing property of a hidden Markov chain are used to properly fuse the two, and are finally used in the research of this paper. Experiments show that, using the same training samples, the recognition accuracy of the three-layer BP neural network is only 91%, while the recognition accuracy of the fusion discriminant model proposed in this paper can reach 95.1%. The results show that the fusion of BP neural network and hidden Markov chain has a strong solving ability for the task of wearable exoskeleton recognition of target step speed.

AB  - Introduction Non-invasive tools capable of identifying predictors of maternal complications would be a step forward for improving maternal and perinatal health. There is an association between modification in physical activity (PA) and sleep-wake patterns and the occurrence of inflammatory, metabolic, pathological conditions related to chronic diseases. The actigraphy device is validated to estimate PA and sleep-wake patterns among pregnant women. In order to extend the window of opportunity to prevent, diagnose and treat specific maternal conditions, would it be possible to use actigraphy data to identify risk factors for the development of adverse maternal outcomes during pregnancy?
   Methods and analysis A cohort will be held in five centres from the Brazilian Network for Studies on Reproductive and Perinatal Health. Maternal Actigraphy Exploratory Study I (MAES-I) will enrol 400 low-risk nulliparous women who will wear the actigraphy device on their wrists day and night (24 hours/ day) uninterruptedly from 19 to 21 weeks until childbirth. Changes in PA and sleep-wake patterns will be analysed throughout pregnancy, considering ranges in gestational age in women with and without maternal complications such as pre-eclampsia, preterm birth (spontaneous or provider-initiated), gestational diabetes, maternal haemorrhage during pregnancy, in addition to perinatal outcomes. The plan is to design a predictive model using actigraphy data for screening pregnant women at risk of developing specific adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.
   Ethics and dissemination MAES-I has been reviewed and approved by each institutional review board and also by the National Council for Ethics in Research. Detailed information about the study is provided in the Brazilian Cohort website (www.medscinet.com/samba) and findings will be published in the scientific literature and institutional webpages.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with a higher risk to convert to AD. The information of AD and normal control (NC) subjects can aid the classification between progressive MCI and stable MCI. In this paper, we develop an effective biomarker by combining the auxiliary information of AD and NC subjects with the relationship of brain regions of MCI subject, which makes best of auxiliary information and improves the prediction accuracy of MCI-to-AD conversion. Specifically, a projection vector is first obtained for each MCI subject via graph-guided information propagation. Next, the information of projection vector is integrated using a self-weighting grading method to acquire the novel biomarker. Finally, the self-weighting grading biomarkers derived from multiple morphological features are combined to provide more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed biomarkers for the prediction of MCI conversion.

AB  - Digital mobility assessment using wearable sensor systems has the potential to capture walking performance in a patient's natural environment. It enables monitoring of health status and disease progression and evaluation of interventions in real-world situations. In contrast to laboratory settings, real-world walking occurs in non-conventional environments and under unconstrained and uncontrolled conditions. Despite the general understanding, there is a lack of agreed definitions about what constitutes real-world walking, impeding the comparison and interpretation of the acquired data across systems and studies. The goal of this study was to obtain expert-based consensus on specific aspects of real-world walking and to provide respective definitions in a common terminological framework. An adapted Delphi method was used to obtain agreed definitions related to real-world walking. In an online survey, 162 participants from a panel of academic, clinical and industrial experts with experience in the field of gait analysis were asked for agreement on previously specified definitions. Descriptive statistics was used to evaluate whether consent (> 75% agreement as defined a priori) was reached. Of 162 experts invited to participate, 51 completed all rounds (31.5% response rate). We obtained consensus on all definitions ("Walking" > 90%, "Purposeful" > 75%, "Real-world" > 90%, "Walking bout" > 80%, "Walking speed" > 75%, "Turning" > 90% agreement) after two rounds. The identification of a consented set of real-world walking definitions has important implications for the development of assessment and analysis protocols, as well as for the reporting and comparison of digital mobility outcomes across studies and systems. The definitions will serve as a common framework for implementing digital and mobile technologies for gait assessment and are an important link for the transition from supervised to unsupervised gait assessment.

AB  - Early disease diagnosis is crucial for timely and effective healthcare monitoring and treatment. Demand for modern point-of-care (POC) technologies has increased during the past decade. Continuous monitoring of patient health status can be achieved through wearable sensors which can be incorporated into clothing and other wearables. While electronic textiles that monitor physical parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) are increasingly commonplace, smart textiles capable of monitoring chemical biomarkers are much less common. In this work, a conductive plasmonic electrochemical sensor was developed from a cotton blend fabric modified with silver nanoparticles and conductive inks. para-Aminothiophenol (pATP) was used as an initial probe molecule to evaluate the performance of the fabric-based electrode for electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopic (EC-SERS) measurements. Further investigation was then carried out to detect levofloxacin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, in both 0.1 M NaF and synthetic urine as supporting electrolyte. It was found that the fabric-based electrode provided excellent EC-SERS signals, comparable to commercial screen-printed electrodes, allowing for rapid detection of levofloxacin at clinically relevant concentrations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a fabric-based electrode has been reported for EC-SERS investigations, highlighting a promising platform for wearable point-of-care sensors.

AB  - Precision medicine is the application of genotypic and Omics biomarkers to determine the most appropriate, outcome-driven therapy for individual patients. To determine the best choice of therapy, institutions use significant information technology enabled data from imaging, electronic medical records, sensors in the clinic/hospitals, and wearable sensors to determine treatment response. With genomic profiling, targets to affect a disease course are continuing to be developed. As clonal mutational prevalence continues to be understood, information can be communicated to patients to inform them that resistance is common, requiring collection of more genetic mutations from patients with further biopsies or blood collection.

AB  - This paper describes the development and implementation of a two-spring model to predict the performance of hybrid compression textiles combining passive elastic fabrics and integrated NiTi shape memory alloy (SMA) coil actuators. An analytic model that treats passive fabricSMA coil systems as conjoined linear springs is presented to predict garment passive and active counter-pressure as a function of 11 design variables. For a fixed SMA coil design (encompassing five design variables), the model predicts that passive fabric material modulus, initial length, width and thickness determine both passive counter-pressure magnitude and activation stroke length, and that passive and active pressures are highly dependent on the relative unstretched lengths of the conjoined SMA-fabric system compared to the total limb circumference. Several passive fabrics were tested to determine their moduli and to generally assess the fabric linearity model assumption: two fabrics (spandex and neoprene) were found to behave linearly up to 200% strain, while two other fabrics (flat polyester elastic and a trilaminate Lycra) were found to be nonlinear in the same strain envelope. Five hypothetical compression tourniquet designs are presented using experimentally determined fabric characteristics and previously studied SMA actuators developed at MIT. The performance of each tourniquet design is discussed with a specific focus on mechanical counter-pressure (MCP) space suit design requirements, with designs presented that achieve the full MCP design specification (> 29.6 kPa) while minimizing (< 5 mm) garment thickness. The modeling framework developed in this effort enables compression garment designers to tailor counterpressure and activation stroke properties of active compression garments based on a variety of design parameters to meet a wide range of performance specifications.

AB  - Scientific research into methodologies and algorithms to improve support for medical diagnoses remains in high demand on the agenda. Computer-aided diagnostic systems that use the Internet of Things (IoT) enable greater accessibility and integration between patients and specialists. One of the steps covered by IoT systems is the segmentation of Regions of Interest (ROI) in digital images. The challenge to segment these ROI in IoT systems is to apply methods that have low computational and storage costs with reliable results. Thus this work proposes the use of edge computing with a new approach based on active contours to target the ROI in medical images called FLog Parzen Level Set (FPLS). The method can be divided into two stages. First is the initialization of the seed point using Parzen Window and clusterization using Floor of Log. Second the growth and refinement of the region with probabilistic estimates of the regional contour using the Parzen Window. The proposed method was evaluated using the metrics of Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, Matthews Coefficient Correlation, Hausdorff distance, Dice, and Jaccard Similarity Coefficient. The stable and satisfactory results can be highlighted despite the low computational times and costs. The proposed method was submitted to stroke, lung, and skin disease datasets. The proposed method achieved the fastest mean segmentation time of 1.64s for the three datasets used in this work. The method obtained the highest values for Sensitivity (98.57%), Accuracy (98.77%) and MCC (94.73%) in the stroke dataset, the lowest value for Hausdorff distance (4.24) in the lung dataset, and the highest Dice Coefficient value (92.49%) in the skin dataset. In conclusion, the proposed method is a promising tool for an edge computing system that segments regions of interest with the high precision of a level set and a fast convergence rate.

AB  - Simple Summary Patients treated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T) are at risk for severe toxicities post-treatment. Patient-reported outcomes and activity data from fitness trackers could be helpful for monitoring patients after CAR-T. The aim of this pilot study was to test the feasibility and acceptability of having patients complete surveys on a rigorous schedule and wear a Fitbit tracker continuously, from before their CAR-T infusion through 90-days post-infusion. In a sample of 12 patients with hematologic malignancies, we demonstrated feasibility and acceptability, with high rates of behavioral adherence to the study procedures. These findings suggest that large-scale data collection efforts using these procedures will be successful. In turn, patient-reported outcomes and activity data could be used to identify predictors of severe CAR-T-related toxicities. Background: Clinicians must closely monitor patients for toxicities after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T). Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (e.g., toxicities, quality of life) and activity data (e.g., steps, sleep) may complement clinicians' observations. This study tested the feasibility and acceptability of collecting PROs and activity data from patients with hematologic malignancies during CAR-T and explored preliminary data patterns. Methods: Participants wore a Fitbit tracker and completed PROs at several timepoints through 90-days post-infusion. Feasibility was assessed with a priori benchmarks for recruitment (>= 50%), retention (>= 70%), PRO completion (>= 70%), and days wearing the Fitbit (>= 50%). Acceptability was assessed with participant satisfaction (a priori benchmark > 2 on a 0-4 scale). Results: Participants (N = 12) were M = 66 years old (SD = 7). Rates of recruitment (68%), retention (83%), PRO completion (85%), and days wearing the Fitbit (85%) indicated feasibility. Satisfaction with completing the PROs (M = 3.2, SD = 0.5) and wearing the Fitbit (M = 2.9, SD = 0.5) indicated acceptability. Preliminary data patterns suggested that participants with better treatment response (vs. progressive disease) had a higher toxicity burden. Conclusions: Longitudinal PRO and activity data collection was feasible and acceptable. Data collected on a larger scale may be used to specify risk prediction models to identify predictors of severe CAR-T-related toxicities and inform early interventions.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewPolysomnography (PSG) represents a fundamental diagnostic tool used in the evaluation of sleep disorders. It represents a simultaneous recording of sleep staging, eye movements, electromyographic tone, respiratory parameters, and electrocardiogram. It is particularly helpful in the assessment of sleep-disordered breathing and its management, propensity for excessive sleepiness, complex behaviors during sleep, including motor disturbances of sleep, sleep-related epilepsy, and parasomnias. This review is intended to summarize the indications for PSG, the limitations and challenges of this diagnostic tool, indications for home sleep apnea testing options, and new developments and trends in polysomnography.Recent FindingsThe polysomnogram is fundamentally important in the evaluation of sleep-disordered breathing in the setting of cardiovascular comorbidities and neurologic conditions such as neuromuscular disease, stroke, and epilepsy and in the evaluation of dream enactment behavior in the setting of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Because RBD is predictive of neurodegenerative disorders, recent data highlights the importance of PSG in corroborating the diagnosis of RBD and identifying people who may be at risk. However, due to cost as well as limitations in access to care, further testing has been developed and implemented including the home sleep apnea test (HSAT). The evolution of consumer wearable devices has also been a growing trend in sleep medicine; however, few have received appropriate validation.SummaryPSG has been used in both the clinical and research settings and remains the gold standard clinical diagnostic test for suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or central sleep apnea (CSA). Clinicians must be familiar with the basic indications for a PSG but also recognize when it is absolutely required. At this time, the PSG is essential in the evaluation of nocturnal hypoventilation disorders of sleep, periodic limb movements of sleep, and central nervous system hypersomnia (in the absence of CSF hypocretin) when combined with the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and is probably the only way to help differentiate among complex behaviors during sleep, especially in the setting of RBD. The capacity to establish an early diagnostic risk of potential dementia would be of critical importance once neuroprotective agents become available.

AB  - EEG-based emotion classifiers have the potential of significantly improving the social integration of patients suffering from neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or the acute stages of Alzheimer's disease. Emotion classifiers have historically used software on general-purpose computers and operating under off-line conditions. Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted, hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications. The EEG signals are generated using a low-cost, off-the-shelf device, namely, Emotiv Epoc C, and then denoised and pre-processed ahead of their use by BioCNN. For training and testing, BioCNN uses three repositories of emotion classification datasets, including the publicly available DEAP and DREAMER datasets, along with an original dataset collected in-house from 5 healthy subjects using standard visual stimuli. Asubject-specific training approach is used under TensorFlow to train BioCNN, which is implemented using the Digilent Atlys Board with a low-cost Spartan-6 FPGA. The experimental results show a competitive energy efficiency of 11 GOps/W, a throughput of 1:65 GOps that is in line with the real-time specification of a wearable device, and a latency of less than 1 ms, which is smaller than the 150 ms required for human interaction times. Its emotion inference accuracy is competitive with the top software-based emotion detectors.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) progressively impairs motor and cognitive performance. The current tools to detect decline in motor and cognitive functioning are often impractical for busy clinics and home settings. To address the gap, we designed an instrumented trail-making task (iTMT) based on a wearable sensor (worn on the shin) with interactive game-based software installed on a tablet. The iTMT test includes reaching to 5 indexed circles, a combination of numbers (1-3) and letters (A&B) randomly positioned inside target circles, in a sequential order, which virtually appears on a screen kept in front of the participants, by rotating one's ankle joint while standing and holding a chair for safety. By measuring time to complete iTMT task (iTMT time), iTMT enables quantifying cognitive-motor performance. Purpose: This study's objective is to examine the feasibility of iTMT to detect early cognitive-motor decline in PDs. Method: Three groups of volunteers, including 14 cognitively normal (CN) older adults, 14 PDs, and 11 mild cognitive impaireds (MCI), were recruited. Participants completed MoCA, 20 m walking test, and 3 trials of iTMT. Results: All participants enabled to complete iTMT with <3 min, indicating high feasibility. The average iTMT time for CN-Older, PD, and MCI participants were 20.9 +/- 0.9 s, 32.3 +/- 2.4 s, and 40.9 +/- 4.5 s, respectively. After adjusting for age and education level, pairwise comparison suggested large effect sizes for iTMT between CN-older versus PD (Cohen's d = 1.7, p = 0.024) and CN-older versus MCI (d = 1.57, p < 0.01). Significant correlations were observed when comparing iTMT time with the gait speed (r = -0.4, p = 0.011) and MoCA score (r = -0.56, p < 0.01). Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility and early results supporting the potential application of iTMT to determine cognitive-motor and distinguishing individuals with MCI and PD from CN-older adults. Future studies are warranted to test the ability of iTMT to track its subtle changes over time.

AB  - Inertial measurement units (IMU) are proven as efficient tools for swimming analysis by overcoming the limits of video-based systems application in aquatic environments. However, coaches still believe in the lack of a reliable and easy-to-use analysis system for swimming. To provide a broad view of swimmers' performance, this paper describes a new macro-micro analysis approach, comprehensive enough to cover a full training session, regardless of the swimming technique. Seventeen national level swimmers (5 females, 12 males, 19.6 +/- 2.1 yrs) were equipped with six IMUs and asked to swim 4 x 50 m trials in each swimming technique (i.e., frontcrawl, breaststroke, butterfly, and backstroke) in a 25 m pool, in front of five 2-D cameras (four under water and one over water) for validation. The proposed approach detects swimming bouts, laps, and swimming technique in macro level and swimming phases in micro level on all sensor locations for comparison. Swimming phases are the phases swimmers pass from wall to wall (wall push-off, glide, strokes preparation, swimming, and turn) and micro analysis detects the beginning of each phase. For macro analysis, an overall accuracy range of 0.83-0.98, 0.80-1.00, and 0.83-0.99 were achieved, respectively, for swimming bouts detection, laps detection and swimming technique identification on selected sensor locations, the highest being achieved with sacrum. For micro analysis, we obtained the lowest error mean and standard deviation on sacrum for the beginning of wall-push off, glide and turn (-20 +/- 89 ms, 4 +/- 100 ms, 23 +/- 97 ms, respectively), on shank for the beginning of strokes preparation (0 +/- 88 ms) and on wrist for the beginning of swimming (-42 +/- 72 ms). Comparing the swimming techniques, sacrum sensor achieves the smallest range of error mean and standard deviation during micro analysis. By using the same macro-micro approach across different swimming techniques, this study shows its efficiency to detect the main events and phases of a training session. Moreover, comparing the results of both macro and micro analyses, sacrum has achieved relatively higher amounts of accuracy and lower mean and standard deviation of error in all swimming techniques.

AB  - We have developed novel stereoscopic wearable multimodal intraoperative imaging and display systems entitled Integrated Imaging Goggles for guiding surgeries. The prototype systems offer real time stereoscopic fluorescence imaging and color reflectance imaging capacity, along with in vivo handheld microscopy and ultrasound imaging. With the Integrated Imaging Goggle, both wide-field fluorescence imaging and in vivo microscopy are provided. The real time ultrasound images can also be presented in the goggle display. Furthermore, real time goggle-to-goggle stereoscopic video sharing is demonstrated, which can greatly facilitate telemedicine. In this paper, the prototype systems are described, characterized and tested in surgeries in biological tissues ex vivo. We have found that the system can detect fluorescent targets with as low as 60 nM indocyanine green and can resolve structures down to 0.25 mm with large FOV stereoscopic imaging. The system has successfully guided simulated cancer surgeries in chicken. The Integrated Imaging Goggle is novel in 4 aspects: it is (a) the first wearable stereoscopic wide-field intraoperative fluorescence imaging and display system, (b) the first wearable system offering both large FOV and microscopic imaging simultaneously, (c) the first wearable system that offers both ultrasound imaging and fluorescence imaging capacities, and (d) the first demonstration of goggle- to-goggle communication to share stereoscopic views for medical guidance.

AB  - Introduction Accelerometry-based activity counting for measuring arm use is prone to overestimation due to non-functional movements. In this paper, we used an inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based gross movement (GM) score to quantify arm use.
   Methods In this two-part study, we first characterized the GM by comparing it to annotated video recordings of 5 hemiparetic patients and 10 control subjects performing a set of activities. In the second part, we tracked the arm use of 5 patients and 5 controls using two wrist-worn IMUs for 7 and 3 days, respectively. The IMU data was used to develop quantitative measures (total and relative arm use) and a visualization method for arm use.
   Results From the characterization study, we found that GM detects functional activities with 50-60% accuracy and eliminates non-functional activities with >90% accuracy. Continuous monitoring of arm use showed that the arm use was biased towards the dominant limb and less paretic limb for controls and patients, respectively.
   Conclusions The gross movement score has good specificity but low sensitivity in identifying functional activity. The at-home study showed that it is feasible to use two IMU-watches to monitor relative arm use and provided design considerations for improving the assessment method.

AB  - Background: Asymptomatic atrial fibrillation [AF] is an important cause of fatal or disabling stroke. A continuous heart-rate monitoring device, comfortable enough to be worn continuously and reliable enough to detect AF, would allow for prompt initiation of anticoagulation therapy to prevent stroke.
   Methods: We studied a new custom-made wearable photo-plethysmograph [PPG] wrist-watch sensor, specifically designed for continuous heart rate monitoring and incorporating contact and motion noise-filters. We tested its ability to automatically detect AF in patients undergoing elective cardioversion of AF, using simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram [ECG] as gold standard.
   Results: A total of 18,608 consecutive R-R-interval measurements were recorded simultaneously with PPG and ECG in 20 patients, including 12,521 [67.3%] R-R-intervals during AF and 6087 [32.7%] R-R intervals during sinus rhythm. Scatter plots and Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that the PPG signals were highly correlated to the simultaneously recorded ECG [R = 0.980, p < 0.001], both during AF and during sinus rhythm. The automatic algorithm distinguished AF from sinus rhythm with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 93.1%.
   Conclusions: This PPG-based wrist-watch sensor reliably detected AF in non-ambulatory patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Nowadays, the hectic work life of people has led to sleep deprivation. This may further result in sleep-related disorders and adverse physiological conditions. Therefore, sleep study has become an active research area. Sleep scoring is crucial for detecting sleep-related disorders like sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, periodic leg movement (PLM), and restless leg syndrome (RLS). Sleep is conventionally monitored in a sleep laboratory using polysomnography (PSG) which is the recording of various physiological signals. The traditional sleep stage scoring (SSG) done by professional sleep scorers is a tedious, strenuous, and time-consuming process as it is manual. Hence, developing a machine-learning model for automatic SSG is essential. In this study, we propose an automated SSG approach based on the biorthogonal wavelet filter bank's (BWFB) novel least squares (LS) design. We have utilized a huge Wisconsin sleep cohort (WSC) database in this study. The proposed study is a pioneering work on automatic sleep stage classification using the WSC database, which includes good sleepers and patients suffering from various sleep-related disorders, including apnea, insomnia, hypertension, diabetes, and asthma. To investigate the generalization of the proposed system, we evaluated the proposed model with the following publicly available databases: cyclic alternating pattern (CAP), sleep EDF, ISRUC, MIT-BIH, and the sleep apnea database from St. Vincent's University. This study uses only two unipolar EEG channels, namely O1-M2 and C3-M2, for the scoring. The Hjorth parameters (HP) are extracted from the wavelet subbands (SBS) that are obtained from the optimal BWFB. To classify sleep stages, the HP features are fed to several supervised machine learning classifiers. 12 different datasets have been created to develop a robust model. A total of 12 classification tasks (CT) have been conducted employing various classification algorithms. Our developed model achieved the best accuracy of 83.2% and Cohen's Kappa of 0.7345 to reliably distinguish five sleep stages, using an ensemble bagged tree classifier with 10-fold cross-validation using WSC data. We also observed that our system is either better or competitive with existing state-of-art systems when we tested with the above-mentioned five databases other than WSC. This method yielded promising results using only two EEG channels using a huge WSC database. Our approach is simple and hence, the developed model can be installed in home-based clinical systems and wearable devices for sleep scoring.

AB  - Concern about falling is prevalent and increases the risk of falling in people with peripheral neuropathy (PN). However, the assessment of concern about falling relies on self-report surveys, and thus continuous monitoring has not been possible. We investigated the influence of concern about falling on sensor-based daily physical activity among people with PN. Forty-nine people with PN and various levels of concern about falling participated in this study. Physical activity outcomes were measured over a period of 48 hours using a validated chest-worn sensor. The level of concern about falling was assessed using the falls efficacy scale-international (FES-I). The low concern group spent approximately 80 min more in walking and approximately 100 min less in sitting/lying compared to the high concern group. In addition, the low concern group had approximately 50% more walking bouts and step counts compared to the high concern group. Across all participants, the duration of walking bouts and total step counts was significantly correlated with FES-I scores. The duration of walking bouts and total step counts may serve as eHealth targets and strategies for fall risk assessment among people with PN.

AB  - Traditional cancer detection imaging techniques suffer high costs, high false negatives, high false positives, and pain. The microwave imaging techniques overcome the limitations, which depend primarily on antenna design. If an antenna is wearable and implantable, the imaging system gives better results with less pain and cost. A wide band fabric antenna that operates at the ultra-wideband frequency with a low specific absorption rate (SAR) on breast phantom is verified. The proposed design has Jeans material as a substrate and the copper patch as a radiating element. The patch is designed in a circular shape with an M-type slot to suppress the spurious modes. The designed antenna model is commonly used for monitoring microwave imaging and has dimensions of 28X30X1.6 mm3. The proposed antenna design covers 2.3-8 GHz frequency with a broadside radiation pattern. The gain over the operating frequency is about 2.3-4.5 dB, and the efficiency is 55 %-79 %. The antenna model was designed and simulated in CST microwave studio. The performance of an antenna is tested on breast cancer to detect the presence of tumor cells in the breast. The antenna analysis on the phantom was done by considering the tumor location and corresponding results are presented. By varying the sizes of the tumor the antenna performance is analysed. The simulated SAR values of the proposed antenna design on breast phantom are under the limits of FCC.

AB  - This paper reports a highly sensitive, non-invasive sensor for real-time glucose monitoring from interstitial fluid. The structure is comprised of a chip-less tag sensor which may be taped over the patient's skin and a reader, that can be embedded in a smartwatch. The tag sensor is energized through the established electromagnetic coupling between the tag and the reader and its frequency response is reflected on the spectrum of the reader in the same manner. The tag sensor consumes zero power as there is no requirement for any active readout or communication circuitry on the tag side. When measuring changes in glucose concentrations within saline replicating interstitial fluid, the sensor was able to detect glucose with an accuracy of similar to 1 mM/l over a physiological range of glucose concentrations with 38 kHz of the resonance frequency shift. This high sensitivity is attained as a result of the proposed new design and extended field concentration on the tag. The impact of some of the possible interferences on the response of the sensor's performance was also investigated. Variations in electrolyte concentrations within the test samples have a negligible effect on the response of the sensor unless these variations are supra-physiologically large.

AB  - Motion velocity, acceleration, and energy expenditure estimations are important in quantitative assessments for physical recovery and exercise-based interventions for post-stroke patients with partial losses of neurological functions. This paper proposes a novel wearable motion estimation device using a micro flow sensor, which realizes motion velocity, acceleration detection, and energy expenditure estimation for human limb motion. A homemade micro thermal flow sensor is used to detect motion velocity. Jerk-Kalman based algorithm is proposed to extract motion acceleration from the flow sensor outputs. Motion velocity and acceleration are used to estimate energy expenditure of limb motion. Calibration experiments and application cases are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the methodology. The micro flow sensor based motion estimation method is free of accumulated error, robust for dynamic motion measurement, and provides a promising auxiliary approach for evaluating energy expenditures of human limbs in rehabilitation training.

AB  - Bone loss and osteoporosis is a serious health problemworldwide. The impact of osteoporosis is far greater than many other serious health problems, such as breast and prostate cancers. Statistically, one in three women and one in five men over 50 years of age will experience osteoporotic fractures in their life. In this paper, the design and development of a portable IoT-based sensing system for early detection of bone loss have been presented. The CTx-I biomarker was measured in serum samples as a marker of bone resorption. A planar interdigital sensor was used to evaluate the changes in impedance by any variation in the level of CTx-I. Artificial antibodies were used to introduce selectivity to the sensor for CTx-I molecule. Artificial antibodies for CTx-I molecules were created using molecular imprinted polymer ( MIP) technique in order to increase the stability of the system and reduce the production cost and complexity of the assay procedure. Real serum samples collected from sheep blood were tested and the result validation was done by using an ELISA kit. The PoC device was able to detect CTx-I concentration as low as 0.09 ng/mL. It exhibited an excellent linear behavior in the range of 0.1-2.5 ng/mL, which covers the normal reference ranges required for bone loss detection. Future possibilities to develop a smart toilet for simultaneous measurement of different bone turnover biomarkers was also discussed.

AB  - Neuromuscular fatigue affects workers productivity and health, which is further deteriorated with chronic conditions such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Enhanced physiological tremor, a key indicator of neuromuscular fatigue, shows great potential in detecting the onset of neuromuscular fatigue. This study aims to determine the feasibility of using a cost-effective wearable accelerometer-based microelectromechanical sensor to convey neuromuscular fatigue-related tremor information in healthy and T1D adults. 42 adults (22 healthy, 20 T1D), equipped with a finger and a wrist accelerometer, performed intermittent submaximal isometric handgrip fatigue exercises using a grip dynamometer. Motor variability feature, namely, Coefficient of Variation (CV), and motor complexity feature, namely approximate entropy (ApEn), were extracted from the force signal of dynamometer and from the finger and wrist tremor accelerometry signals and subjected to statistical analysis. First, significant positive correlations were found between tremor accelerometry and force signal in terms of motor variability and complexity features. Second, a three-way (fatigue phase: early, middle, late; gender: male, female; condition: healthy, T1D) analysis of variance resulted in a significant fatigue effect on both accelerometry and force measurements in terms of motor variability and complexity features. Apart from finger CV, no other features showed any gender or condition effects. These findings indicate that finger and wrist tremors measured by accelerometer-based sensors can retain the robustness of fatigue-related motor variability and complexity. Wrist tremor features were found to capture fatigue development across both healthy and diabetic males and females, thereby offering comparable fatigue detection and management in adults with chronic conditions.

AB  - Background: Optimized abnormalities of individual brain network may allow earlier detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and accurate prediction of its conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently, most studies constructed individual networks based on region-to-region correlation without employing multi-region information. In order to develop the potential discriminative power of network and provide supportive evidence for feasibility of individual metabolic network study, we propose a new approach to extract features from network with indirect relation based on F-18-FDG PET data.
   New Method: Direct relation based individual network is first constructed using Gaussian kernel function. After that, the lattice-close-degree in fuzzy mathematics is applied to reflect region-to-region indirect relation using the direct relations of regions and their common neighbors. The proposed approach has been evaluated on 199 MCI subjects and 166 normal controls (NC) using SVM classifier.
   Results: The indirect relation based network features significantly promote classification performance in separating MCI from normal controls (NC) as well as MCI converters from non-converters. Specially, further improvements can be obtained by combining indirect relation features with ADAS-cog scores. Moreover, the discriminative regions we found are consistent with previous studies, indicating the efficacy of our constructed network in identifying correct biomarkers for diagnosing MCI and predicting its conversion.
   Comparison with Existing Method(s): More accurate MCI identification of PET data can be achieved by features of network with indirect relation.
   Conclusions: This work provides a new way to investigate brain network from metabolic perspective for accurate identification of MCI.

AB  - Precision medicine calls for high demand of continuous, closed-loop physiological monitoring and accurate control, especially for cardiovascular diseases. Cardiac optogenetics is promising for its superiority of cell selectivity and high time-space accuracy, but the efficacy of optogenetics relative to the input of light stimulus is detected and controlled separately by discrete instruments in vitro, which suffers from time retardation, energy consumption, and poor portability. Thus, a highly integrated system based on implantable sensors combining closed-loop self-monitoring with simultaneous treatment is highly desired. Here, we report a self-adaptive cardiac optogenetics system based on an original negative stretching-resistive strain sensor array for closed-loop heart rate recording and self-adaptive light intensity control. The strain sensor exhibits a dual and synchronous capability of precise monitor and physiological-electrical-optical regulation. In an in vivo ventricular tachycardia model, our system demonstrates the potential of a negative stretching-resistive device in controlling-in-sensor electronics for wearable/implantable autodiagnosis and telehealth applications.

AB  - With the development of wireless sensing, researchers have proposed many contactless vital sign monitoring systems, which can be used to monitor respiration rates, heart rates, cardiac cycles and etc. However, these vital signs are ones of coarse granularity, so they are less helpful in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Considering that electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important evidence base for the diagnoses of CVDs, we propose to generate ECGs from ultra-wideband (UWB) signals in a contactless manner as a fine-grained cardiac monitoring solution. Specifically, we analyze the properties of UWB signals containing heartbeats and respiration, and design two complementary heartbeat signal restoration methods to perfectly recover heartbeat signal variation. To establish the mapping between the mechanical activity of the heart sensed by UWB devices and the electrical activity of the heart recorded in ECGs, we construct a conditional generative adversarial network to encode the mapping between mechanical activity and electrical activity and propose a contrastive learning strategy to reduce the interference from noise in UWB signals. We build the corresponding cardiac monitoring system named RF-ECG and conduct extensive experiments using about 120,000 heartbeats from more than 40 participants. The experimental results show that the ECGs generated by RF-ECG have good performance in both ECG intervals and morphology compared with the ground truth. Moreover, diseases such as tachycardia/bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, and premature contractions can be diagnosed from the ECGs generated by our RF-ECG.

AB  - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common heart arrhythmias. It is known to cause up to 15% of all strokes. In current times, modern detection systems for arrhythmias, such as single-use patch electrocardiogram (ECG) devices, have to be energy efficient, small, and affordable. In this work, specialized hardware accelerators were developed. First, an artificial neural network (NN) for the detection of AF was optimized. Special attention was paid to the minimum requirements for the inference on a RISC-V-based microcontroller. Hence, a 32-bit floating-point-based NN was analyzed. To reduce the silicon area needed, the NN was quantized to an 8-bit fixed-point datatype (Q7). Based on this datatype, specialized accelerators were developed. Those accelerators included single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) hardware as well as accelerators for activation functions such as sigmoid and hyperbolic tangents. To accelerate activation functions that require the e-function as part of their computation (e.g., softmax), an e-function accelerator was implemented in the hardware. To compensate for the losses of quantization, the network was expanded and optimized for run-time and memory requirements. The resulting NN has a 7.5% lower run-time in clock cycles (cc) without the accelerators and 2.2 percentage points (pp) lower accuracy compared to a floating-point-based net, while requiring 65% less memory. With the specialized accelerators, the inference run-time was lowered by 87.2% while the F1-Score decreased by 6.1 pp. Implementing the Q7 accelerators instead of the floating-point unit (FPU), the silicon area needed for the microcontroller in 180 nm-technology is below 1 mm2.

AB  - In clinical, the center of pressure (CoP) is commonly used for accessing the stability of a person's postural control, which is highly associated with various neurological diseases and movement disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic ankle instability. Such a disease usually has a long development or rehabilitation process which requires long-term CoP monitoring. The current CoP evaluation process does not meet the requirement, as it is often complicated and expensive through either the lab-based equipment or the clinical evaluation procedure. Different wearable sensor-based systems with less cost and restrictions have emerged, but their way of CoP calculation requires deliberate calibration of the positions of their sensors, which are not feasible in daily CoP monitoring. In this study, we developed a long-term CoP monitoring system in a smart-shoe form. First, a thin and flexible smart insole with optimal sensor locations was designed to be compact and energy sufficient for a whole-day usage. Then, a user-friendly app on the smartphone with a cloud-based data managing system was developed for applications in both clinical and home environments. Additionally, a simplified CoP estimation model was created without the need for calibration. Lastly, a machine learning-based human activity recognition method was incorporated to make the CoP detection process more automatic. Through a thorough validation test with the clinical level lab equipment, our system can generate the CoP measurements with high accuracy.

AB  - Detection of breast cancer in its early stage is critical for reducing the death rate. In this paper, a compact and flexible breast tumor sensing system is designed using dual-polarized UWB antenna arrays. Each UWB unit is composed of two orthogonally placed circular monopoles, which are printed on flexible and low-profile Kapton polyimide. The antennas are fed by single-side coplanar waveguides for size reduction. A wide band from 3.9 GHz to 19 GHz is obtained, with an isolation of above 16 dB over the operating band. High fidelity factors are achieved at different solid angles, indicating little distortion of the signal and stable sensing ability. To obtain the image of the tumor, eight UWB units are employed surrounding the breast phantom. Using the reflected and scattered signals from the antennas, 3D images of the breast are reconstructed using delay-and-sum (DAS) algorithm. Attributed to the dual-polarized UWB antennas, accurate location and size of the tumors are retained with little clutter. Moreover, the proposed system can detect two tumors with an edge to edge distance of 15 mm. Experiments have been carried out on rotating platforms, with the tumor successfully detected in the measurement. The proposed tumor sensing system is suitable for wearable applications due to its compact size and flexibility.

AB  - The Electrocardiography (ECG) serves as a standard method for diagnosing cardiovascular disease due to its minimal risk, affordable price and simple application. Clinical information is embedded implicitly in the intervals, amplitude or morphology of different waves that represent the heart-beat cycle in the form of ECG signals. Manually delineating the ECG signals to locate the boundaries of the P, QRS, and T waves in each heart-beat typically requires a long time professional training. To facilitate the delineation and to increase precision, we propose a post-processing refined ECG delineation method that takes full advantage of the morphological information of a heartbeat cycle both in classifying each sample point in the ECG recording using 1D-UNet and determining the boundaries of these waveforms. To proceed, the ECG signals are split into pieces of only one heart beat cycle before sending into the 1D-UNet. These single beat-annotated ECG segments enable the network better extract the local and global features of different waveforms in the ECG, which gives rise to a very precise categorization of each sample point. The post-processing algorithm then uses the morphological information of ECG signal to get rid of the influence of the misclassified data points on the extraction of the onset/offset of different wave components. Tests carried on the two public ECG databases, i.e., the LUDB and QTDB show satisfactory delineation performance, with sensitivities 99.88% and 99.48%, respectively. These results suggest possible applications in wearable and wireless devices for health monitoring.

AB  - Prevention of diabetic foot ulcers is important to reduce the burden of diabetic foot disease. However, we found that ulcer prevention is underexposed in research and clinical practice. Barriers to explain this are seen in patient's goal-setting; in the lack of interdisciplinary teams for ulcer prevention; in sample sizes and funding for research; in industrial engagement; and in limited understanding of ulcer development. Rather than separately solving these barriers, we propose a paradigm shift from stratified healthcare towards personalized medicine for diabetic foot disease. Personalized medicine aims to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, based on individual diagnostics. Different treatment strategies should be available for different patients, delivered in an integrated, objective, quantitative and evidence-based approach. More than on the classical risk factors of peripheral neuropathy and peripheral artery disease, individual diagnostics should focus on modifiable risk factors for ulceration. This includes structured biomechanical and behavioral profiling, while new research with (big) data science may identify additional risk factors, such as geographical or temporal patterns in ulceration. Industry involvement can drive the development of wearable instruments and assessment tools, to facilitate large-scale individual diagnostics. For a paradigm shift towards personalized medicine in prevention, large-scale collaborations between stakeholders are needed. As each ulcer episode not prevented costs about Euro10,000 in medical costs alone, such investments can be cost-effective. We hope to see more discussions around this paradigm shift, and increasing investments of energy and money in diabetic foot ulcer prevention in research and clinical practice.

AB  - Nowadays, bone cancer patients using expandable prostheses (EPs) have to go to the clinic frequently to determine the limb length and to perform the extension if necessary, as long as their age-based growth lasts. This situation brings along problems such as increased physician workload, the patient's exposure to radiation at each measurement, a larger rate of extension due to the long interval period between each extension and thus reducing patient comfort as well as making the daily life of the patient difficult. In this study, a biomechatronic tumor prosthesis which is able to determine the need for extension by means of its hardware and intelligent control structure was developed to eliminate the aforementioned problems. Mechanical analysis of the designed prosthesis has been performed in the simulation environment, the prototype of the prosthesis has been produced, wireless communication and control system have been created and the performance of the system has been tested on the experimental setup. Limb length discrepancies (LLDs) of 1 mm and above between the healthy limb and the limb with a prosthesis were able to be detected by the system, and prosthesis extension procedure was successfully performed against the maximum soft tissue resistance to be possibly encountered.

AB  - Background: Lower quantity and poorer sleep quality are common in most older adults, especially for those who live in a nursing home. The use of wearable devices, which measure some parameters such as the sleep stages, could help to determine the influence of sleep quality in daily activity among nursing home residents. Therefore, this study aims to analyse the influence of sleep and its changes concerning the health status and daily activity of older people who lived in a nursing home, by monitoring the participants for a year with Xiaomi Mi Band 2. Methods: This is a longitudinal study set in a nursing home in [Details omitted for double-anonymized peer reviewed]. The Xiaomi Mi Band 2 will be used to measure biomedical parameters and different assessment tools will be administered to participants for evaluating their quality of life, sleep quality, cognitive state, and daily functioning. Results: A total of 21 nursing home residents participated in the study, with a mean age of 86.38 +/- 9.26. The main outcomes were that sleep may influence daily activity, cognitive state, quality of life, and level of dependence in activities of daily life. Moreover, environmental factors and the passage of time could also impact sleep. Conclusions: Xiaomi Mi Band 2 could be an objective tool to assess the sleep of older adults and know its impact on some factors related to health status and quality of life of older nursing homes residents.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of self-reported shoulder pain in the UK has been estimated at 16%. This has been linked with significant sleep disturbance. It is possible that this relationship is bidirectional, with both symptoms capable of causing the other. Within the field of sleep monitoring, there is a requirement for a mobile and unobtrusive device capable of monitoring sleep posture and quality. This study investigates the feasibility of a wearable sleep system (WSS) in accurately detecting sleeping posture and physical activity.
   Methods: Sixteen healthy subjects were recruited and fitted with three wearable inertial sensors on the trunk and forearms. Ten participants were entered into a 'Posture' protocol; assuming a series of common sleeping postures in a simulated bedroom. Five participants completed an 'Activity' protocol, in which a triphasic simulated sleep was performed including awake, sleep and REM phases. A combined sleep posture and activity protocol was then conducted as a 'Proof of Concept' model. Data were used to train a posture detection algorithm, and added to activity to predict sleep phase. Classification accuracy of the WSS was measured during the simulations.
   Results: The WSS was found to have an overall accuracy of 99.5% in detection of four major postures, and 92.5% in the detection of eight minor postures. Prediction of sleep phase using activity measurements was accurate in 97.3% of the simulations. The ability of the system to accurately detect both posture and activity enabled the design of a conceptual layout for a user-friendly tablet application.
   Conclusions: The study presents a pervasive wearable sensor platform, which can accurately detect both sleeping posture and activity in non-specialised environments. The extent and accuracy of sleep metrics available advances the current state-of-the-art technology. This has potential diagnostic implications in musculoskeletal pathology and with the addition of alerts may provide therapeutic value in a range of areas including the prevention of pressure sores.

AB  - Histopathology diagnosis is an important standard for breast tumors identifying. However, histopathology image analysis is complex, tedious, and error-prone, due to the super-resolution image. In recent years, deep learning technology has been successfully applied to histopathology image analysis and made great progress. The well-known deep neural networks usually have tens of million parameters, which consume much memory to deploy the state-of-the-art model. In addition, deep neural networks rely on high-performance hardware resources, which impede the deployment of the state-of-the-art model on portable equipment. In this work, a novel framework which consists of a weight accumulation method and a lightweight fast neural network (FastNet) was proposed for tumor fast identification (TFI) in mobile-computer-assisted devices. The weight accumulation method was designed to obtain the tissue mask regions of interest and remove the useless background area in histopathology images, which greatly reduces the redundant computation cost. Furthermore, we proposed the lightweight FastNet to improve the computational efficiency on mobile devices. A novel attention loss (AttLoss) function was designed and applied in FastNet. The AttLoss function pays more attention on the positive samples and the indistinguishable samples, which greatly improves the performance. The proposed FastNet was compared with three state-of-the-art methods commonly used for image classification and object detection. Experimental results indicated that FastNet achieves the highest recall of 96.94%, the highest F-1 score of 97.33%, and the highest accuracy of 97.34%, besides least trainable parameters of 0.22M and smallest floating point operations of 210M FLOPs.

AB  - Soft robotics requires new actuators and artificial muscles that are lighter, less expensive, and more effective than current technologies. Recently developed bubble artificial muscles (BAMs) are lightweight, flexible, inexpensive, pneumatic actuators with the capability of being scalable, contracting at a low pressure, and generating sufficient tension and contraction for assisting human mobility. The BAMs are simply fabricated by using a commercial plastic tubing with retaining rings, forming a "bubble" shape and creating a series of contractile units to attain a desired stroke. They can deliver high contraction through optimization of actuator length and radius, or high tension by strengthening their materials to operate at high pressure. Here, we present a detailed analysis of BAMs, define a model for their actuation, and verify the model through a series of experiments with fabricated BAM actuators. In tests, a maximum contraction of 43.1% and a maximum stress of 0.894 MPa were achieved, corresponding to the BAM lifting a load 1000 times its own weight (5.39 g). The BAM model was built to predict experimental performance, for example, the relationship between tension and contraction at various applied pressures, and between contraction and pressure. Characteristic analysis and design optimization of the BAM are presented as an approach to design and manufacture the ideal "bubble" actuator at any required dimensions. A BAM orthosis is demonstrated as assisting a sit-to-stand transition on a leg mechanism, constructed to match the scale of a human's lower limb. Guidelines for further improvement of the BAM are also included.

AB  - Developing highly-efficient membranes for toxin clearance in small-format hemodialysis presents a fabrication challenge. The miniaturization of fluidics and controls has been the focus of current work on hemodialysis (HD) devices. This approach has not addressed the membrane efficiency needed for toxin clearance in small-format hemodialysis devices. Dr. Willem Kolff built the first dialyzer in 1943 and many changes have been made to HD technology since then. However, conventional HD still uses large instruments with bulky dialysis cartridges made of similar to 2 m(2)of 10 micron thick, tortuous-path membrane material. Portable, wearable, and implantable HD systems may improve clinical outcomes for patients with end-stage renal disease by increasing the frequency of dialysis. The ability of ultrathin silicon-based sheet membranes to clear toxins is tested along with an analytical model predicting long-term multi-pass experiments from single-pass clearance experiments. Advanced fabrication methods are introduced that produce a new type of nanoporous silicon nitride sheet membrane that features the pore sizes needed for middle-weight toxin removal. Benchtop clearance results with sheet membranes (similar to 3 cm(2)) match a theoretical model and indicate that sheet membranes can reduce (by orders of magnitude) the amount of membrane material required for hemodialysis. This provides the performance needed for small-format hemodialysis.

AB  - Aberrant activation of signaling pathways is frequently observed and reported to be associated with the progression and poor prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa). We aimed to identify key biological processes regulated by androgen receptor (AR) using gene co-expression network from single cell resolution. The bimodal index was used to evaluate whether two subpopulations exist among the single cells. Gene expression among single cells revealed averaging pitfalls and bimodality pattern. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify modules of highly correlated genes. Twenty-nine gene modules were identified and AR-regulated modules were screened by significantly overlapping reported androgen induced differentially expressed genes. The biological function "generation of precursor metabolites and energy" was significantly enriched by AR-regulated modules with bimodality, presenting differential androgen response among subpopulations. Integrating with public ChIP-seq data, two genes FECH, and CROT has AR binding sites. Public in vitro studies also show that androgen regulates FECH and CROT. After receiving androgen deprivation therapy, patients lowly express FECH and CROT. Further survival analysis indicates that FECH/CROT signature can predict PCa recurrence. We reveal the heterogeneous function of "generation of precursor metabolites and energy" upon androgen stimulation from the perspective of single cells. Inhibitors targeting this biological process will facilitate to prevent prostate cancer progression.

AB  - We report the design and implementation of an affordable bedside device, Neo is capable of acquiring vital data in real time by integrating with diverse devices connected to newborns in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). NICUs are equipped with multiple vital sign monitoring devices that are connected to the premature newborn and acquire a few gigabytes of data every day. The continuous vital data from these devices are manually documented every hour. This introduces errors and loses a large amount of high-resolution data. The intermittent documentation of physiological data also makes it difficult for clinicians to visualize and detect the trends of diagnostic utility. Neo is built on an affordable Internet of Things platform that aggregates and sends the real-time data to a cloud-based big data platform called integrated NICU. Apart from minimizing documentation errors, the device enables data acquisition at sufficiently real-time rates as to indicate the current status of all the patients at the NICU. Neo automates immediate vital sign status and past trends as graphs or charts that the doctor and nurses can view from anywhere through the Internet. Physiological signal and clinical parameters from Neo is used to score different diseases like sepsis, respiratory distress syndrome, necrotizing enterocolitis, and retinopathy of prematurity. This score predicts the physiological health of the newborn and aid clinicians in decision-making ensuring timely intervention.

AB  - Developing flexible and wearable enzyme-free biosensors for detecting glucose is indispensable for preliminary diabetes diagnosis and human healthcare monitoring. Herein, an innovative flexible Co3O4 nanoparticles uniformly embedded in 3D porous laser-induced graphene (Co3O4 NPs-LIG) electrode is fabricated by a new one-step laser direct writing carbonization technique. The hybrid electrode featuring the remarkable synergistic effect on account of the excellently conductive LIG and multiple high activation sites of Co3O4 NPs can enhance charge transfer, thereby boosting glucose sensing performance. Benefit from the dramatic properties, the proposed flexible non-enzymatic glucose biosensor exhibits a prominent glucose sensitivity of 214 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), an extremely low limit of detection of 0.41 mu M, a wide linear detection of 1 mu M to -9 mM, and a fast response time within 0.49 s. Additionally, impressive repeatability, favorable stability, and great selectivity are achieved in the detection of glucose concentration. Finally, a possible sensing mechanism of the glucose biosensor is also discussed based on the First principles. This study provides a novel and facile strategy for constructing hetero-structure of transition metal oxide NPs embedded in LIG, which serves to develop flexible and wearable highly sensitive enzyme-free biosensors for detecting glucose in the near future.

AB  - Haptics plays a significant role not only in the rehabilitation of neurological disorders, such as stroke, by substituting necessary cognitive information but also in human-computer interfaces (HCIs), which are now an integral part of the recently launched metaverse. This study proposes a unique, soft, monolithic haptic feedback device (SoHapS) that was directly manufactured using a low-cost and open-source fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer by employing a combination of soft conductive and nonconductive thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) materials (NinjaTek, USA). SoHapS consists of a soft bellow actuator and a soft resistive force sensor, which are optimized using finite element modeling (FEM). SoHapS was characterized both mechanically and electrically to assess its performance, and a dynamic model was developed to predict its force output with given pressure inputs. We demonstrated the efficacy of SoHapS in substituting biofeedback with tactile feedback, such as gripping force, and proprioceptive feedback, such as finger flexion-extension positions, in the context of teleoperation. With its intrinsic properties, SoHapS can be integrated into rehabilitation robots and robotic prostheses, as well as augmented, virtual, and mixed reality (AR/VR/MR) systems, to induce various types of bio-mimicked feedback.

AB  - The inconvenience and risk associated with the regular use of invasive blood glucose measurements has led to tremendous research in this area. This paper proposes the design of a non-invasive blood glucose estimation system using novel Mel frequency cepstral coefficients features of wristband photoplethysmogram signal and physiological parameters. A dataset from 217 participants of a hospital in Cuenca Ecuador is used to validate the proposed model. The support vector regression (SVR) and extreme gradient boost regression (XGBR) techniques are used to estimate blood glucose levels (BGL). The XGBR technique achieves the least value for the standard error of prediction (SEP), 9.78 mg/dL. Further, 5 features are selected from the feature set based on the feature importance in XGBR. The XGBR model with the reduced feature set results in further reduction of SEP value (5.53 mg/dL) with a correlation coefficient of 0.99. Standard Clarke error grid analysis and Bland-Altman analysis shows that the predicted glucose values are in the clinically acceptable region. The results of the proposed model demonstrate the potential of wearable BGL monitoring technology.

AB  - Aiming at the problem of insufficient health monitoring of the elderly in the existing home care system, this paper designs a health information analysis and early warning system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which can monitor the physiological data of the elderly in real time. It also can be based on the elderly real-time monitoring data, physical examination data, and other types of health data, which can be used to predict diseases, so as to achieve "early detection and early treatment" of diseases. First, analyse and design the architecture and content of the home care monitoring system based on the Internet of Things. Secondly, based on the collected heart rate, blood pressure, and three-axis acceleration information of the elderly, it is analysed to determine whether the elderly are in danger of falling, and the designed system is used for early warning. Finally, this paper analyses the prediction algorithm theory of the disease prediction module in the health monitoring software of the home care system. In order to improve the accuracy of prediction, the DS evidence theory is used to optimize the traditional BP neural network (BPNN) algorithm and conduct experimental tests. The test results show that the health information analysis and early warning software of the home care system meet actual needs and achieve the expected goals.

AB  - Introduction Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the third most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide, with smoking and diabetes being the strongest risk factors. The most prominent symptom is leg pain while walking, known as intermittent claudication. To improve mobility, first-line treatment for intermittent claudication is supervised exercise programmes, but these remain largely unavailable and economically impractical, which has led to the development of structured home-based exercise programmes. This trial aims to determine the effectiveness and cost advantage of TeGeCoach, a 12-month long home-based exercise programme, compared with usual care of PAD. It is hypothesised that TeGeCoach improves walking impairment and lowers the need of health care resources that are spent on patients with PAD.
   Methods and analysis The investigators conduct a prospective, pragmatic randomised controlled clinical trial in a health insurance setting. 1760 patients diagnosed with PAD at Fontaine stage II are randomly assigned to either TeGeCoach or care-as-usual. TeGeCoach consists of telemonitored intermittent walking exercise with medical supervision by a physician and telephone health coaching. Participants allocated to the usual care group receive information leaflets and can access supervised exercise programmes, physical therapy and a variety of programmes for promoting a healthy lifestyle. The primary outcome is patient reported walking ability based on the Walking Impairment Questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures include quality of life, health literacy and health behaviour. Claims data are used to collect total health care costs, healthcare resource use and (severe) adverse events. Outcomes are measured at baseline, 12 and 24 months.
   Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Medical Association Hamburg. Findings are disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, reports to the funding body, conference presentations and media press releases. Data from this trial are made available to the public and researchers upon reasonable request.

AB  - Background: Monitoring mental health outcomes has traditionally been based on heuristic decisions, often based on scarce, subjective evidence, making the clinical decisions made by professionals, as well as the monitoring of these diseases, subject to flaws. However, the digital phenotype , which refers to the analysis of data collected by measuring human behavior with mobile sensors and smart bracelets, is a promising tool for filling this gap in current clinical practice.
   Objective: The objectives of this study are to develop the digital phenotyping of patients with alcohol use disorder and anxiety symptoms using data collected from a mobile device (ie, smartphone) and a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit) and to analyze usability and patient satisfaction with the data collection service provided by the app.
   Methods: We propose to conduct a study among a group of 60 participants split into two subgroups-experimental and control-of 30 participants each. The experimental group will be recruited by physicians from the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, and the control group will be recruited on a volunteer basis through fliers and social media. All participants will go through pretraining to ensure technological capability and understanding of tasks, then each participant will download the HumanITcare app and will be given a wearable sensor (ie, Fitbit). Throughout the 4 -month period, participants will be monitored on a range of factors, including sleep cycle, heart rate, movement patterns, and sociability. All data from the wearable sensors and the mobile devices will be saved and sent to the HumanITcare server. Participants will be asked to complete weekly questionnaires about anxiety, depression, and alcohol use disorder symptoms. Research assistants will ensure timely responses. The data from both sensors will then be compared to the questionnaire responses to determine how accurately the devices can predict the same symptoms.
   Results: The recruitment phase was completed in November 2019 and all the data were collected by the end of December 2019. Data are being processed; this process is expected to be completed by October 2020.
   Conclusions: This study was created and conducted as a pilot study with the Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of our approach. The study is focused on patients diagnosed with anxiety and alcohol use disorder, but participants were also monitored for depressive symptoms throughout the trial, although these were not part of the initial inclusion criteria. A limitation to our study was the exclusive use of Android smartphones over iOS devices; this could result in a potential selection bias, due to the accessibility and affordability of Android phones as opposed to iOS-based phones. Another limitation might be that reviews of usability and satisfaction could be confounded by factors such as age and familiarity. An additional function that we might add in future studies is the ability for patients to manage their own data.

AB  - Wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) and wearable technologies are the new trends in healthcare applications. This technology can provide real-time monitoring of the patient's biosignals and health condition. In this context, the analysis of ECG signals, reflecting the heart activity, is considered as the key tool in diagnosing cardiac disorders such as atrial fibrillation (AF) that can lead to strokes and heart failure. Classical approaches for sensor-based AF detection require continuous transmission of ECG signals to a remote server, which can rapidly exhaust the sensor energy and shorten the lifetime of the application. In this paper, we propose a new low-power scheme for AF episodes detection in ECG signal that is intended for implementation in WBSN. The paper details the design of this scheme and demonstrates its high accuracy for AF detection and shows that it saves 93% of energy.

AB  - Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease, associated with a number of cardiovascular diseases. We sought to investigate whether AS increases the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a nationwide population-based study.
   Methods: A total of 14,129 patients newly diagnosed with AS (mean age 41.8 +/- 15.3 years, 72% male) were recruited from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2010 and 2014 and followed up for new onset AF. Age-and sex-matched non-AS subjects (1: 5, n = 70,645) were selected and compared with the AS patients.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, AF was newly diagnosed in 486 patients (114 patients of the AS group). The AS patients developed AF more frequently than the non-AS subjects (2.32 vs. 1.51 per 1000 person-years). In multivariate Cox regression analysis, AS was an independent risk factor for AF (Hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [1.03-1.58]). The AS with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) therapy group showed higher risk for AF (HR 1.60 [1.02-2.39]). In younger patients of the AS group (patients <40 years old), the risk for AF was three times higher than patients at same age in the non-AS group. AS was an independent risk factor for AF in men, but not in women (HR 1.53 [1.18-1.95]; HR 1.42 [0.94-2.08], respectively).
   Conclusions: AS was an independent risk factor for AF, especially in those under 40 years of age and those administered TNFi. It would be reasonable to screen for AF and stroke prevention in these high-risk patients. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Myocardial infarction is one of the most threatening cardiovascular diseases for human beings. With the rapid development of wearable devices and portable electrocardiogram (ECG) medical devices, it is possible and conceivable to detect and monitor myocardial infarction ECG signals in time. This paper proposed a multi-channel automatic classification algorithm combining a 16-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory network (LSTM) for I-lead myocardial infarction ECG. The algorithm preprocessed the raw data to first extract the heartbeat segments; then it was trained in the multi-channel CNN and LSTM to automatically learn the acquired features and complete the myocardial infarction ECG classification. We utilized the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) database for algorithm verification, and obtained an accuracy rate of 95.4%, a sensitivity of 98.2%, a specificity of 86.5%, and an F1 score of 96.8%, indicating that the model can achieve good classification performance without complex handcrafted features.

AB  - Frailty assessment is dependent on the availability of trained personnel and it is currently limited to clinic and supervised setting. The growing aging population has made it necessary to find phenotypes of frailty that can be measured in an unsupervised setting for translational application in continuous, remote, and in-place monitoring during daily living activity, such as walking. We analyzed gait performance of 161 older adults using a shin-worn inertial sensor to investigate the feasibility of developing a foot-worn sensor to assess frailty. Sensor-derived gait parameters were extracted and modeled to distinguish different frailty stages, including non-frail, pre-frail, and frail, as determined by Fried Criteria. An artificial neural network model was implemented to evaluate the accuracy of an algorithm using a proposed set of gait parameters in predicting frailty stages. Changes in discriminating power was compared between sensor data extracted from the left and right shin sensor. The aim was to investigate the feasibility of developing a foot-worn sensor to assess frailty. The results yielded a highly accurate model in predicting frailty stages, irrespective of sensor location. The independent predictors of frailty stages were propulsion duration and acceleration, heel-off and toe-off speed, mid stance and mid swing speed, and speed norm. The proposed model enables discriminating different frailty stages with area under curve ranging between 83.2-95.8%. Furthermore, results from the neural network suggest the potential of developing a single-shin worn sensor that would be ideal for unsupervised application and footwear integration for continuous monitoring during walking.

Projections suggest an older, generally healthier, better-informed but financially less secure patient population of wider cultural and ethnic diversity that live throughout the United States. A pragmatic yet structured approach is recommended to prepare health care professionals and patients for emerging pharmacotherapy needs. Clinician training should include genomics, cloud computing, use of large data sets, implementation science, and cultural competence. Patients will need support for wearable devices and reassurance regarding digital medicine.

AB  - Accurate recognition of progressive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is helpful to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is still challenging to extract effective biomarkers from multivariate brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features to accurately differentiate the progressive MCI from stable MCI. We develop novel biomarkers by combining subspace learning methods with the information of AD as well as normal control (NC) subjects for the prediction of MCI conversion using multivariate structural MRI data. Specifically, we first learn two projection matrices to map multivariate structural MRI data into a common label subspace for AD and NC subjects, where the original data structure and the one-to-one correspondence between multiple variables are kept as much as possible. Afterwards, the multivariate structural MRI features of MCI subjects are mapped into a common subspace according to the projection matrices. We then perform the self-weighted operation and weighted fusion on the features in common subspace to extract the novel biomarkers for MCI subjects. The proposed biomarkers are tested on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results indicate that our proposed biomarkers outperform the competing biomarkers on the discrimination between progressive MCI and stable MCI. And the improvement from the proposed biomarkers is not limited to a particular classifier. Moreover, the results also confirm that the information of AD and NC subjects is conducive to predicting conversion from MCI to AD. In conclusion, we find a good representation of brain features from high-dimensional MRI data, which exhibits promising performance for predicting conversion from MCI to AD.

AB  - Single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful tool to explore the heterogeneity of breast cancer. The identification of the cell subtype that responds to estrogen has profound significance in breast cancer research and treatment. The transcriptional regulation of estrogen is an intricate network involving crosstalk between protein-coding and non-coding RNAs, which is still largely unknown, particularly at the single cell level. Therefore, we proposed a novel strategy to specify cell subtypes based on a cell-specific ceRNA network (CCN). The CCN was constructed by integrating a cell-specific RNA-RNA co-expression network (RCN) with an existing ceRNA network. The cell-specific RCN was built based on single cell expression profiles with predefined reference cells. Heterogeneous cell subtypes were inferred by enriching RNAs in CCN to the estrogen response hallmark. Edge biomarkers were identified in the early estrogen response subtype. Topological analysis revealed that NEAT1 was a hub lncRNA for the early response subtype, and its ceRNAs could predict patient survival. Another hub lncRNA, DLEU2, could potentially be involved in GPCR signaling, based on CCN. The CCN method that we proposed here facilitates the inference of cell subtypes from a network perspective and explores the function of hub lncRNAs, which are promising targets for RNA-based therapeutics.

KW  - MORTALITY
AB  - Cardiorespiratory fitness is an established predictor of metabolic disease and mortality. Fitness is directly measured as maximal oxygen consumption (VO(2)max), or indirectly assessed using heart rate responses to standard exercise tests. However, such testing is costly and burdensome because it requires specialized equipment such as treadmills and oxygen masks, limiting its utility. Modern wearables capture dynamic real-world data which could improve fitness prediction. In this work, we design algorithms and models that convert raw wearable sensor data into cardiorespiratory fitness estimates. We validate these estimates' ability to capture fitness profiles in free-living conditions using the Fenland Study (N=11,059), along with its longitudinal cohort (N = 2675), and a third external cohort using the UK Biobank Validation Study (N = 181) who underwent maximal VO(2)max testing, the gold standard measurement of fitness. Our results show that the combination of wearables and other biomarkers as inputs to neural networks yields a strong correlation to ground truth in a holdout sample (r = 0.82, 95CI 0.80-0.83), outperforming other approaches and models and detects fitness change over time (e.g., after 7 years). We also show how the model's latent space can be used for fitness-aware patient subtyping paving the way to scalable interventions and personalized trial recruitment. These results demonstrate the value of wearables for fitness estimation that today can be measured only with laboratory tests.

AB  - Oral cancer is the world's sixth most prevalent form of cancer and tongue is the most common site in oral cancer. Here, we report the feasibility of contact thermometry for the identification of tongue tumour at its early stage. The thermal and geometrical tumour parameters were predicted by contact temperature measurements of the tongue in a closed mouth. A suitable thermal sensor arrangement had been developed for obtaining the temperature distribution of the tongue. A computational method had been modelled for estimating tumour parameters using limited number of discrete temperature data. Heat transfer in the closed mouth had been modelled using Pennes bio heat transfer equation and the parameter optimization had been carried out using Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) method. The sensor array developed could identify the subtle change in temperature due to tumour in the tongue. The tongue having tumour showed a maximum variation of 0.4 K in the surface temperature. The geometrical and thermal parameters of tumour were simultaneously estimated with 88 % accuracy. Upon adding a random error of +/- 1 % to the simulated temperature data, no significant changes were observed in the estimation. The tumour parameter estimation methodology shows that high metabolic heat generation and high blood perfusion source term indicates the presence of tumour. The predicted location and the size of the tumour can be used for pathological investigations. We propose that a wireless wearable system integrated with thermal sensors can be used for monitoring tongue surface temperature and eventually, the early detection of tongue cancer.

AB  - Background and objective: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a useful tool for detecting heart disease. Automated ECG diagnosis allows for heart monitoring on small devices, especially on wearable devices. In order to recognize arrhythmias automatically, accurate classification method for electrocardiogram (ECG) heartbeats was studied in this paper.
   Methods: Based on weighted extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), a hierarchical classification method is proposed. A large number of features from 6 categories are extracted from the preprocessed heartbeats. Then recursive feature elimination is used for selecting features. Afterwards, a hierarchical classifier is constructed in classification stage. The hierarchical classifier is composed of threshold and XGBoost classifiers. And the XGBoost classifiers are improved with weights.
   Results: The method was applied to an inter-patient experiment conforming AAMI standard. The obtained sensitivities for normal (N), supraventricular (S), ventricular (V), fusion (F), and Unknown beats (Q) were 92.1%, 91.7%, 95.1%, and 61.6%. Positive predictive values of 99.5%, 46.2%, 88.1%, and 15.2% were also provided for the four classes.
   Conclusions: XGBoost was improved and firstly introduced in single heartbeat classification. A comparison showed the effectiveness of the novel method. The method was more suitable for clinical application as both high positive predictive value for N class and high sensitivities for abnormal classes were provided. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim: A variety of consumer-facing wearables, devices and apps are marketed directly to consumers to detect atrial fibrillation (AF). However, their management is not defined. Our aim was to explore their role for AF screening via a survey.
   Methods and Results: An anonymous web-based survey was undertaken by 588 health care professionals (HCPs) (response rate 23.7%). Overall, 57% HCPs currently advise wearables/apps for AF detection in their patients: this was much higher for electrophysiologists and nurses/allied health professionals (74-75%) than cardiologists (57%) or other physicians (34-38%). Approximately 46% recommended handheld (portable) single-lead dedicated ECG devices, or, less frequently, wristband ECG monitors with similar differentials between HCPs . Only 10-15% HCPs advised photoplethysmographic wristband monitors or smartphone apps. In over half of the HCP consultations for AF detected by wearables/apps, the decision to screen was entirely the patients. About 45% of HCPs perceive a potential role for AF screening in people aged > 65 years or in those with risk factors. Almost 70% of HCPs believed we are not yet ready for mass consumer-initiated screening for AF using wearable devices/ apps, with patient anxiety, risk of false positives and negatives, and risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding perceived as potential disadvantages, and perceived need for appropriate management pathways.
   Conclusions: There is a great potential for appropriate use of consumer-facing wearables/apps for AF screening. However, it appears that there is a need to better define suitable individuals for screening and an appropriate mechanism for managing positive results before they can be recommended by HCPs.

AB  - Growing life expectancy and increasing incidence of multiple chronic health conditions are significant societal challenges. Different technologies have been proposed to address these issues, detect critical events, such as stroke or falls, and monitor automatically human activities for health condition inference and anomaly detection. This paper aims to investigate two types of sensing technologies proposed for assisted living: wearable and radar sensors. First, different feature selection methods are validated and compared in terms of accuracy and computational loads. Then, information fusion is applied to enhance activity classification accuracy combining the two sensors. Improvements in classification accuracy of approximately 12% using feature level fusion are achieved with both support vector machine s (SVMs) and knearest neighbor (KNN) classifiers. Decision-level fusion schemes are also investigated, yielding classification accuracy in the order of 97%-98%.

AB  - A major concern of public health authorities is to also encourage adults to be exposed to enriched environments (sensory and cognitive-motor activity) during the pandemic lockdown, as was recently the case worldwide during the COVID-19 outbreak. Games for adults that require physical activity, known as exergames, offer opportunities here. In particular, the output of the gaming industry nowadays offers computer games with extended reality (XR) which combines real and virtual environments and refers to human-machine interactions generated by computers and wearable technologies. For example, playing the game in front of a computer screen while standing or walking on a force plate or treadmill allows the user to react to certain infrastructural changes and obstacles within the virtual environment. Recent developments, optimization, and minimizations in wearable technology have produced wireless headsets and sensors that allow for unrestricted whole-body movement. This makes the virtual experience more immersive and provides the opportunity for greater engagement than traditional exercise. Currently, XR serves as an umbrella term for current immersive technologies as well as future realities that enhance the experience with features that produce new controllable environments. Overall, these technology-enhanced exergames challenge the adult user and modify the experience by increasing sensory stimulation and creating an environment where virtual and real elements interact. As a therapy, exergames can potentially create new environments and visualizations that may be more ecologically valid and thus simulate real activities of daily living that can be trained. Furthermore, by adding telemedicine features to the exergame, progress over time can be closely monitored and feedback provided, offering future opportunities for cognitive-motor assessment. To more optimally serve and challenge adults both physically and cognitively over time in future lockdowns, there is a need to provide long-term remote training and feedback. Particularly related to activities of daily living that create opportunities for effective and lasting rehabilitation for elderly and sufferers from chronic non-communicable diseases (CNDs). The aim of the current review is to envision the remote training and monitoring of physical and cognitive aspects for adults with limited mobility (due to disability, disease, or age), through the implementation of concurrent telehealth and exergame features using XR and wireless sensor technologies.

AB  - Individuals with mobility impairments represent a large portion of the population. These impairments are often the sequels of strokes, spinal cord injury, or diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Many of these diagnoses manifest in upper-extremity mobility impairment, which may prohibit or make difficult actuating devices within the home. While solutions exist for smart-home automation and control, a few are approachable by those with mobility impairments. To address this issue, we designed Inviz, a touchless low-power assistive gesture recognition system that utilizes an array of textile capacitive sensors to control a smart-home automation system. We present two novel research contributions; the use of flexible textile-based capacitive arrays as differential proximity sensors, and a low-power event-driven hierarchical signal processing algorithm for capacitor sensor arrays. A fully functional prototype system is implemented and evaluated in the context of an end-to-end home automation system using intuitive swipe and hover gestures that are comfortable and approachable for users with mobility impairments. The evaluation demonstrates that the system achieves high accuracy (> 90%) while maintaining low latency (< 1 s) and low energy consumption (2475 mu W). In addition, we evaluate the system on a subject with upper extremity mobility impairment to verify its usage as an accessibility device.

AB  - Background The search for valid preclinical biomarkers of cerebellar dysfunction is a key research goal for the upcoming era of early interventional approaches in spinocerebellar ataxias. This study aims to describe novel preclinical biomarkers of subtle gait and postural sway abnormalities in prodromal spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (pre-SCA2).
   Methods Thirty pre-SCA2 patients and their matched healthy controls underwent quantitative assessments of gait and postural sway using a wearable sensor-based system and semiquantitative evaluation of cerebellar features by SARA (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia) score.
   Results Quantitative analysis of natural gait showed a significantly larger variability of the swing period, toe-off angle and toe-out angle in pre-SCA2, and larger mean coronal and transverse ranges of motion of the trunk at the lumbar location and of the sagittal range of motion of the trunk at the sternum location compared to controls. During tandem gait, pre-SCA2 subjects showed larger lumbar, trunk, and arm ranges of motion than controls. Postural sway analysis showed excessive body oscillation that was increased in tandem stance. Overall, these abnormalities were detected in pre-SCA2 patients without clinical evidence of abnormalities in SARA. The toe-off angle and swing time variability were significantly correlated with the time to ataxia onset, whereas the toe-off angle and transverse range of motion at trunk position during tandem gait were significantly associated with the SARA score.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates early alteration of gait and postural sway control in prodromal SCA2 using a wearable sensor-based system. This offers new pathophysiological hints into this early disease stage and provides novel potential biomarkers for future clinical trials.

AB  - Introduction: In the past years, robotic lower-limb exoskeletons have become a powerful tool to help clinicians improve the rehabilitation process of patients who have suffered from neurological disorders, such as stroke, by applying intensive and repetitive training. However, active subject participation is considered to be an important feature to promote neuroplasticity during gait training. To this end, the present study presents the performance assessment of the AGoRA exoskeleton, a stance-controlled wearable device designed to assist overground walking by unilaterally actuating the knee and hip joints.Methods: The exoskeleton's control approach relies on an admittance controller, that varies the system impedance according to the gait phase detected through an adaptive method based on a hidden Markov model. This strategy seeks to comply with the assistance-as-needed rationale, i.e., an assistive device should only intervene when the patient is in need by applying Human-Robot interaction (HRI). As a proof of concept of such a control strategy, a pilot study comparing three experimental conditions (i.e., unassisted, transparent mode, and stance control mode) was carried out to evaluate the exoskeleton's short-term effects on the overground gait pattern of healthy subjects. Gait spatiotemporal parameters and lower-limb kinematics were captured using a 3D-motion analysis system Vicon during the walking trials.Results and Discussion: By having found only significant differences between the actuated conditions and the unassisted condition in terms of gait velocity (? = 0.048) and knee flexion (? = 0.001), the performance of the AGoRA exoskeleton seems to be comparable to those identified in previous studies found in the literature. This outcome also suggests that future efforts should focus on the improvement of the fastening system in pursuit of kinematic compatibility and enhanced compliance.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and much of this is driven by challenges in its timely diagnosis and treatment. Existing and emerging mobile technologies have been used to successfully identify AF in a variety of clinical and community settings, and while these technologies offer great promise for revolutionizing AF detection and screening, several major barriers may impede their effectiveness. The unclear clinical significance of device-detected AF, potential challenges in integrating patient-generated data into existing healthcare systems and clinical workflows, harm resulting from potential false positives, and identifying the appropriate scope of population-based screening efforts are all potential concerns that warrant further investigation. It is crucial for stakeholders such as healthcare providers, researchers, funding agencies, insurers, and engineers to actively work together in fulfilling the tremendous potential of mobile technologies to improve AF identification and management on a population level.

AB  - Background and objective Continuous monitoring of breathing activity plays a vital role in the detection of respiratory-based diseases (SA, COPD, etc.). Sleep Apnea (SA) is characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep associated with arterial blood denaturation, sympathetic nervous system activation, and cardiovascular impairment. Untreated patients with SA have increased mortality rates compared to the general population. This study aims to design a remote monitoring system for sleep apnea to ensure patient safety and ease the workload of doctors in the Covid-19 era.
   Methods This study aims to design a remote monitoring system for sleep apnea to ensure patient safety and ease the workload of doctors. Our study focuses on a novel portable real-time low-cost sleep apnea monitoring system utilizing the GSM network (GSM Shield Sim900a). Proposed system is a remote monitoring and patient tracking system to detect the apnea event in real time, and to provide information of the sleep position, pulse, and respiratory and oxygen saturation to the medical specialists (SpO(2)) by establishing a direct contact. As soon as an abnormal condition is detected in the light of these parameters, the condition is reported (instant or in the form of short reports after sleep) to the patient relatives, the doctor's mobile telephone or to the emergency medical centers (EMCs) through a GSM network to handle the case depending on the patient's emergency condition.
   Results A study group was formed of six patients for monitoring apnea events (three males and three females) between the ages of 20 and 60. The patients in the study group have sleep apnea (SA) in different grades. All the apnea events were detected, and all the patients were successfully alerted. Also, the patient parameters were successfully sent to all patient relatives. Patients who could not get out of apnea were called through the CALL feature, and they were informed about their ongoing apnea event and told that intervention was necessary. The proposed system is tested on six patients. The beginning moment of apnea was successfully detected and the SMS/CALL feature was successfully activated without delay. During the testing, it has been observed that while some of the patients start breathing after the first SMS, some others needed the second or the third SMS. According to the measurement result, the maximum breathless time is 46 s among the patients, and a SMS is sent every 15 s. In addition, in cases where the patient was breathless for a long time, the CALL feature was actively sought from the relatives of the patient and enabled him to intervene. The proposed monitoring system could be used in both clinical and home settings.
   Conclusions The monitoring of a patient in real time allows to intervene in any unexpected circumstances about the patient. The proposed work uses an acceleration sensor as a reliable method of the sleep apnea for monitoring and prevention. The developed device is more economical, comfortable, and convenient than existing systems not only for the patients but also for the doctors. The patients can easily use this device in their home environment, so which could yield a more comfortable, easy to use, cost-effective, and long-term breathing monitoring system for healthcare applications.

AB  - The inability to identify microscopic tumors and assess surgical margins in real-time during oncologic surgery leads to incomplete tumor removal, increases the chances of tumor recurrence, and necessitates costly repeat surgery. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a wearable goggle augmented imaging and navigation system (GAINS) that can provide accurate intraoperative visualization of tumors and sentinel lymph nodes in real-time without disrupting normal surgical workflow. GAINS projects both near-infrared fluorescence from tumors and the natural color images of tissue onto a head-mounted display without latency. Aided by tumor-targeted contrast agents, the system detected tumors in subcutaneous and metastatic mouse models with high accuracy (sensitivity = 100%, specificity = 98% +/- 5% standard deviation). Human pilot studies in breast cancer and melanoma patients using a near-infrared dye show that the GAINS detected sentinel lymph nodes with 100% sensitivity. Clinical use of the GAINS to guide tumor resection and sentinel lymph node mapping promises to improve surgical outcomes, reduce rates of repeat surgery, and improve the accuracy of cancer staging.

AB  - Sustained involuntary muscle activity (IMA) is a highly disabling phenomenon that arises in the acute phase of an upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL). Wearable probes for long-lasting surface EMG (sEMG) recordings have been recently recommended to detect IMA insurgence and to quantify its evolution over time, in conjunction with a complex algorithm for IMA automatic identification and classification. In this study, we computed sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and overall accuracy (Acc) of this algorithm by comparing it with the classification provided by two expert assessors. Based on sample size estimation, 6020 10 s-long sEMG epochs were classified by both the algorithm and the assessors. Epochs were randomly extracted from long-lasting sEMG signals collected in-field from 14 biceps brachii (BB) muscles of 10 patients (5F, age range 50-71 years) hospitalized in an acute rehabilitation ward following a stroke or a post-anoxic coma and complete upper limb (UL) paralysis. Among the 14 BB muscles assessed, Se was 85.6% (83.6-87.4%); Sp was 89.7% (88.6-90.7%), and overall Acc was 88.5% (87.6-89.4%) and ranged between 78.6% and 98.7%. The presence of IMA was detected correctly in all patients. These results support the algorithm's use for in-field IMA assessment based on data acquired with wearable sensors. The assessment and monitoring of IMA in acute and subacute patients with UMNL could improve the quality of care needed by triggering early treatments to lessen long-term complications.

AB  - Background: Restroom cleanliness is an important factor in hospital quality. Due to its dynamic process, it can be difficult to detect the presence of dirty restrooms that need to be cleaned. Using an Internet of Things (IoT) button can permit users to designate restrooms that need cleaning and in turn, allow prompt response from housekeeping to maintain real-time restroom cleanliness.
   Objective: This study aimed to describe the deployment of an IoT button-based notification system to measure hospital restroom cleanliness reporting system usage and qualitative feedback from housekeeping staff on IoT button use.
   Methods: We deployed IoT buttons in 16 hospital restrooms. Over an 8-month period, housekeeping staff received real-time notifications and responded to button presses for restroom cleaning. All button presses were recorded. We reported average button usage by hospital area, time of day, and day of week. We also conducted interviews with housekeeping supervisors and staff to understand their acceptance of and experience with the system.
   Results: Over 8 months, 1920 requests to clean restrooms in the main hospital lobby and satellite buildings were received. The hospital lobby IoT buttons received over half (N=1055, 55%) of requests for cleaning. Most requests occurred in afternoon hours from 3 PM to midnight. Requests for cleaning remained stable throughout the work week with fewer requests occurring over weekends. IoT button use was sustained throughout the study period. Interviews with housekeeping supervisors and staff demonstrated acceptance of the IoT buttons; actual use was centered around asynchronous communication between supervisors and staff in response to requests to clean restrooms.
   Conclusions: An IoT button system is a feasible method to generate on-demand request for restroom cleaning that is easy to deploy and that users will consistently engage with. Data from this system have the potential to enable responsive scheduling for restroom service and anticipate periods of high restroom utilization in a hospital.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most useful medical examinations for the monitoring of cardiovascular diseases. The position and the duration of the QRS complex on the ECG signal are very important in the diagnosis of these diseases. Even though several R-peak (and hence QRS complex) detection algorithms are available, most are based on complex computations that require off-line processing on a personal computer (PC). However, with the advances in wearable devices and telemedicine, an algorithm that can run efficiently on a microcontroller (or embedded system) is needed. This article presents the development of an embedded algorithm for the detection of the QRS complex of an ECG signal. The algorithm is based on the shape and appearance of the signal. It extracts certain characteristics like the shape of the QRS complex, its slope, trend, and the duration between two successive QRS complexes, and then use them to increase detection accuracy. First, the R-peak is detected through the application of three levels of tests using adaptive thresholds. Second, from each R position, the positions of Q and S are detected using three other tests. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, the MIT-BIH database was used and the sensitivity, positive prediction, and F1 score were used as evaluation metrics. The algorithm obtained average F1 scores of 99.67%, 99.73%, and 99.83% for the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia, Pacemaker Rhythm, and the Normal Sinus Rhythm Databases, respectively. Both normal and abnormal ECG signals were used in this performance test. The algorithm was then implemented on a microcontroller system, and its accuracy and run time were evaluated. The obtained Fl score results were the same as on the personal computer (PC) and an average run time of 16.23 mu s per sample was obtained. The performance of the algorithm was also compared to other commonly used algorithms. The proposed algorithm has great potential in wearable systems for long-term monitoring.

AB  - Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure (BP) monitoring provides hemodynamic information such as BP changes and waveforms over time, providing abundant information to more accurately diagnose a person's cardiovascular health compared to static cuff-based measurements. To overcome the shortcomings of current techniques, a highly sensitive (S = 108.52 kPa(-1) for 0-5 kPa range) soft capacitive sensor that can be worn like a Band-Aid is developed such that continuous beat-to-beat BP monitoring can be sustainably achieved after an initial calibration. The sensor leverages iontronic material with air gaps for the dielectric combined with highly wrinkled, stretchable electrodes; the resulting average sensitivity of this device is demonstrated to be higher than that of other comparable sensors in literature. For the hemodynamic capture, the operating frequency of 300 kHz is chosen to achieve higher temporal resolution in continuous BP monitoring. Further, the multi-island design in this work allows for rapid placement of the sensor without needing to accurately align with the underlying artery. Because of the improved sensitivity, the sensors can be adhered to the pulse points without an applanator. Finally, this sensor demonstrates sustained beat-to-beat blood pressure recordings that show excellent systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure correlation with an FDA-cleared device, the Caretaker.

AB  - Background Telemonitoring, a branch of telemedicine, involves the use of technological tools to remotely detect clinical data and evaluate patients. Telemonitoring of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) should be performed using reliable and discriminant motor measures. Furthermore, the method of data collection and transmission, and the type of subjects suitable for telemonitoring must be well defined. Objective To analyze differences in patients with PD and healthy controls (HC) with the wearable inertial device SensHands-SensFeet (SH-SF), adopting a standardized acquisition mode, to verify if motor measures provided by SH-SF have a high discriminating capacity and high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Methods Altogether, 64 patients with mild-to-moderate PD and 50 HC performed 14 standardized motor activities for assessing bradykinesia, postural and resting tremors, and gait parameters. SH-SF inertial devices were used to acquire movements and calculate objective motor measures of movement (total: 75). For each motor task, five or more biomechanical parameters were measured twice. The results were compared between patients with PD and HC. Results Fifty-eight objective motor measures significantly differed between patients with PD and HC; among these, 32 demonstrated relevant discrimination power (Cohen's d > 0.8). The test-retest reliability was excellent in patients with PD (median ICC = 0.85 right limbs, 0.91 left limbs) and HC (median ICC = 0.78 right limbs, 0.82 left limbs). Conclusion In a supervised environment, the SH-SF device provides motor measures with good results in terms of reliability and discriminant ability. The reliability of SH-SF measurements should be evaluated in an unsupervised home setting in future studies.

AB  - Wireless ECG body sensor Savvy is a feasible solution for reliable and accurate long-term heart rhythm monitoring. However, there were no studies dealing with usability of this sensor in field testing. Accordingly, the aim of the study is to evaluate the quality of the ECG signal measured with wearable wireless ECG body sensor when used in field test settings and to determine how different types of sensor fixation affects the quality of the ECG signal during sub-maximal and maximal running settings. Twenty-three participants, 10 females and 13 males, were included in the study (20.56 +/- 1.19 years). All subjects performed shuttle run (SR), Cooper 2400 m (C), and 100 m sprint test (S), once wearing the sensor attached to self-adhesive skin electrodes, additionally fixed with self-adhesive tapes, and secondly with the sensor attached to Polar belt and strapped around the chest. Test outcomes were compared applying the Student t-test for dependent variables, or the non-parametric Wilcoxon test, depending on the results of the normality test. The results showed a significant difference (p<0.05) in the running speed that provides an assessable ECG signal between two different types of fixation in all three running tests - C, S, SR, as well as between the parameters "QRS detected as negative", "correct software detection", and "detected QRS" in the C and SR tests. Findings obtained in this study proved that if properly fixed, the ECG signal recorded with wireless ECG can be efficiently used for heart monitoring during physical activities in real setting and potentially could be used as additional tool in detection of cardiovascular diseases. In addition, fixation with Polar belt is more adequate for measurements made during physical activity in real setting compared to fixation with tape.

AB  - Difficulty with turning is a major contributor to mobility disability and falls in people with movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Turning often results in freezing and/or falling in patients with PD. However, asking a patient to execute a turn in the clinic often does not reveal their impairments. Continuous monitoring of turning with wearable sensors during spontaneous daily activities may help clinicians and patients determine who is at risk of falls and could benefit from preventative interventions. In this study, we show that continuous monitoring of natural turning with wearable sensors during daily activities inside and outside the home is feasible for people with PD and elderly people. We developed an algorithm to detect and characterize turns during gait, using wearable inertial sensors. First, we validate the turning algorithm in the laboratory against a Motion Analysis system and against a video analysis of 21 PD patients and 19 control (CT) subjects wearing an inertial sensor on the pelvis. Compared to Motion Analysis and video, the algorithm maintained a sensitivity of 0.90 and 0.76 and a specificity of 0.75 and 0.65, respectively. Second, we apply the turning algorithm to data collected in the home from 12 PD and 18 CT subjects. The algorithm successfully detects turn characteristics, and the results show that, compared to controls, PD subjects tend to take shorter turns with smaller turn angles and more steps. Furthermore, PD subjects show more variability in all turn metrics throughout the day and the week.

AB  - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) may related to the risk of thromboembolism and is the most common cardiac risk factor of cryptogenic stroke (CS). Due to its paroxysmal characteristics, it is usually diagnosed by continuous long-term ECG. Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation usually have premature beats at the same time which is easy to be confused with the rhythm of atrial fibrillation. Therefore, in this article, we designed a screening algorithm for single premature beat, multi premature beats, bigeminy and trigeminy premature beats, according to their rhythm characteristics to reduce false detection caused by premature beats during the PAF detection process. The proposed elimination method was verified on ECG segments with different types of premature beats, and tested on long-term ECG data of PAF patients. ECG segments of different kinds of premature beats were selected from MIT Atrial Fibrillation database (MIT-AFDB), MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database (MIT-AR) and wearable ECG data from the China Physiological Signal Challenge 2021 (CPSC 2021). The proposed method can effectively eliminate single premature beat segments with 99.5% accuracy, and it also can eliminate more than 95% of ECG segments with other types of premature beats. We designed PAF-score as a new index to evaluate the accuracy of detection, and we also calculate the misjudged and missed segments to comprehensively evaluate the PAF detection algorithm. The proposed method get a PAF-score of 0.912 on MIT-AFDB. The proposed method also has the potential to implant low computing power wearable devices for real-time analysis.

AB  - Naturalistic driving studies provide opportunities for investigating the effects of key driving exposures on risky driving performance and accidents. New technology provides a realistic assessment of risky driving through the intensive monitoring of kinematic behavior while driving. These studies with their complex data structures provide opportunities for statisticians to develop needed modeling techniques for statistical inference. This article discusses new statistical modeling procedures that were developed to specifically answer important analytical questions for naturalistic driving studies. However, these methodologies also have important applications for the analysis of intensively collected longitudinal data, an increasingly common data structure with the advent of wearable devises. To examine the sources of variation between- and within-participants in risky driving behavior, we explore the use of generalized linear mixed models with autoregressive random processes to analyzing long sequences of kinematic count data from a group of teenagers that have measurements at each trip over a 1.5-year observation period starting after receiving their license. These models provide a regression framework for examining the effects of driving conditions and exposures on risky driving behavior. Alternatively, generalized estimating equations approaches are explored for the situation where we have intensively collected count measurements on a moderate number of participants. In addition to proposing statistical modeling for kinematic events, we explore models for relating kinematic events with crash risk. Specifically, we propose both latent variable and hidden Markov models for relating these 2 processes and for developing dynamic predictors of crash risk from longitudinal kinematic event data. These different statistical modeling techniques are all used to analyze data from the Naturalistic Teenage Driving Study, a unique investigation into how teenagers drive after licensure.

AB  - study to test two primary hypotheses: (i) that sequencing would detect single low-frequency-large effect variants that explained similar amounts of phenotypic variance as single common variants, and (ii) that some common variant associations could be explained by low-frequency variants. We tested two sets of disease-related common phenotypes for which we had statistical power to detect large numbers of common variant-common phenotype associations-11 132 cis-gene expression traits in 450 individuals and 93 circulating biomarkers in all 680 individuals. From a total of 11 657 229 high-quality variants of which 6 129 221 and 5 528 008 were common and low frequency (<5%), respectively, low frequency-large effect associations comprised 7% of detectable cis-gene expression traits [89 of 1314 cis-eQTLs at P < 1 x 10(-06) (false discovery rate similar to 5%)] and one of eight biomarker associations at P < 8 x 10(-10). Very few (30 of 1232; 2%) common variant associations were fully explained by low-frequency variants. Our data show that whole-genome sequencing can identify low-frequency variants undetected by genotyping based approaches when sample sizes are sufficiently large to detect substantial numbers of common variant associations, and that common variant associations are rarely explained by single low-frequency variants of large effect.

AB  - Recent growth in digital technologies has enabled the recruitment and monitoring of large and diverse populations in remote health studies. However, the generalizability of inference drawn from remotely collected health data could be severely impacted by uneven participant engagement and attrition over the course of the study. We report findings on long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in a large multinational observational digital study for depression containing active (surveys) and passive sensor data collected via Android smartphones, and Fitbit devices from 614 participants for up to 2 years. Majority of participants (67.6%) continued to remain engaged in the study after 43 weeks. Unsupervised clustering of participants' study apps and Fitbit usage data showed 3 distinct engagement subgroups for each data stream. We found: (i) the least engaged group had the highest depression severity (4 PHQ8 points higher) across all data streams; (ii) the least engaged group (completed 4 bi-weekly surveys) took significantly longer to respond to survey notifications (3.8 h more) and were 5 years younger compared to the most engaged group (completed 20 bi-weekly surveys); and (iii) a considerable proportion (44.6%) of the participants who stopped completing surveys after 8 weeks continued to share passive Fitbit data for significantly longer (average 42 weeks). Additionally, multivariate survival models showed participants' age, ownership and brand of smartphones, and recruitment sites to be associated with retention in the study. Together these findings could inform the design of future digital health studies to enable equitable and balanced data collection from diverse populations.

AB  - Children's movement is an important issue in child development and outcome in early childhood research, intervention, and practice. Digital sensor technologies offer improvements in naturalistic movement measurement and analysis. We conducted validity and feasibility testing of a real-time, indoor mapping and location system (Ubisense, Inc.) within a preschool classroom. Real-time indoor mapping has several implications with respect to efficiently and conveniently: (a) determining the activity areas where children are spending the most and least time per day (e.g., music); and (b) mapping a focal child's atypical real-time movements (e.g., lapping behavior). We calibrated the accuracy of Ubisense point-by-point location estimates (i.e., X and Y coordinates) against laser rangefinder measurements using several stationary points and atypical movement patterns as reference standards. Our results indicate that activity areas occupied and atypical movement patterns could be plotted with an accuracy of 30.48 cm (1 ft) using a Ubisense transponder tag attached to the participating child's shirt. The accuracy parallels findings of other researchers employing Ubisense to study atypical movement patterns in individuals at risk for dementia in an assisted living facility. The feasibility of Ubisense was tested in an approximately 90-min assessment of two children, one typically developing and one with Down syndrome, during natural classroom activities, and the results proved positive. Implications for employing Ubisense in early childhood classrooms as a data-based decision-making tool to support children's development and its potential integration with other wearable sensor technologies are discussed.

AB  - Flexible biosensors have received intensive attention for real-time, non-invasive monitoring of cancer biomarkers. Highly sensitive tyrosinase biosensors, which are important for melanoma screening, remained a hurdle. Herein, high-performance tyrosinase-sensing field-effect transistor-based biosensors (bio-FETs) have been successfully achieved by self-assen.":ng nanostructured tetrapeptide tryptophan-valine-phenylsianine-tyrosine (WVFY) on n-type metal oxide transistors. In the presence of target tyrosinase, the phenolic hydroxyl groups in WVFY are rapidly converted to benzoquinone with the consumption of protons, which could be detected potentiometrically by bio-FETs. As a result, the WVFY-modified bio-FETs exhibited an ultra-low detection limit of 1.9 fM and an optimal detection range of 10 fM to 1 nM toward tyrosinase sensing. Furthermore, flexible devices fabricated on similar to 2.9-mu m-thick polyimide (PI) substrates illustrated robust mechanical flexibility, which could be attached to human skin conformally. These achievements hold promise for wearable melanoma screening and provide designing guidelines for detecting other important cancer biomarkers with bio-FETs.

AB  - Automatic gait analysis in free-living environments using inertial sensors requires individualized approach as local acceleration and velocity profiles vary with the walker and the topological properties of the environment (e.g., walking in the forest vs. walking on sand). Here, we propose a smartphone-based gait assessment architecture which consists of two data processing modules. The first module employs a set of personalized classifiers for automatic recognition of the walking environment. The second module provides accurate step time estimates by selecting the optimal filtering frequency tailored to the predicted environment. The performance of the architecture was evaluated using experimental data collected from 10 participants walking in 10 different conditions typically encountered during daily living. Compared with ground truth data, the architecture successfully recognized the walking environments; the percentage of correctly classified instances was above 92%. It also estimated step time with high accuracy; the mean absolute error was less than 10 ms, outperforming or at the very least matching the performance levels achieved in controlled laboratory trials (indoor flat surface walking). Compared with using one filtering frequency for all environments, using optimal frequency tailored to each environment reduced step time estimation error by more than 39%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which successfully demonstrates that parameter tuning can improve gait characterization in outdoor environments. However, further research using a larger data set (including more participants with varying demographics and degree of impairment) is needed to confirm this result. Our findings highlight the importance of environment-aware gait analysis, and lay the groundwork for a smartphone-based technology that can be used in the community.

AB  - This cohort study explores whether objectively measured lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, conversation, and sleep, are associated with cortical amyloid burden and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
   Importance Understanding the association of lifestyle factors with mild cognitive impairment enables the development of evidence-based interventions for delaying cognitive impairment. Objective To explore whether objectively measured lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, conversation, and sleep, are associated with cortical amyloid burden and cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included 855 community-dwelling adults in Usuki, Oita Prefecture, Japan, aged 65 years or older. Data were collected from August 2015 to December 2017. Participants were reviewed to examine risk and protective lifestyle factors for dementia. Data analysis was conducted in June 2019. Exposures Wearable sensors, carbon-11 labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography images, and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography images. Main Outcomes and Measures Wearable sensor data, such as walking steps, conversation time, and sleep, were collected from August 2015 to October 2017, and positron emission tomography images were collected from October 2015 to December 2017. A multiple regression model and change-point regression model were used to examine the association of lifestyle factors with mean amyloid or fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, assessed on the basis of a standardized uptake value ratio of the frontal lobes, temporoparietal lobes, and posterior cingulate gyrus with the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. The bootstrap method was used to obtain nonparametric 95% CIs on the associations of lifestyle factors with cognitive decline. Results Of the 855 adults in the study, 118 (13.8%) were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, with a mean (SD) age of 75.7 (5.8) years and 66 (55.9%) women. Total sleep time was inversely associated with fluorodeoxyglucose uptake after adjusting for covariates (beta = -0.287; 95% CI, -0.452 to -0.121, P < .001). Change-point regression showed an inverse association between total sleep time and mean amyloid uptake when sleep duration was longer than 325 minutes (B = -0.0018; 95% CI, -0.0031 to -0.0007). Conclusions and Relevance To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that total sleep time was associated with brain function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Sleep duration is a potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia at the mild cognitive impairment stage.
   Question Are modifiable lifestyle factors associated with cortical amyloid burden or cerebral glucose metabolism in older adults with mild cognitive impairment? Findings This cohort study included 118 older adults with mild cognitive impairment and found that total sleep time was associated with cerebral glucose metabolism after adjusting for covariates and false-discovery rate correction. Meaning In this study, the association of sleep duration with brain function was confirmed in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, thereby strengthening the potential of sleep as an evidence-based intervention for preventing cognitive impairment.

AB  - The presence of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in Apolipoprotein E4 gene is implicated with the increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, detection of AD-related DNA oligonucleotide sequence associated with Apolipoprotein E4 gene sequence was achieved using localized-surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) on 2D-Photonic crystal (2D-PC) and Au-coated 2D-PC surfaces. 2D-PC surfaces were fabricated on a flexible copolymer film using nano-imprint lithography (NIL). The film surface was then coated with a dual-functionalized polymer to react with surface immobilized DNA probe. DNA hybridization was detected by monitoring the optical responses of either a Fresnel decrease in reflectance on 2D-PC surfaces or an increase in LSPR on Au-coated 2D-PC surfaces. The change in response due to DNA hybridization on the modified surfaces was also investigated using mismatched and non-complementary oligonucleotides sequences. The proof-of concept results are promising towards the development of 2D-PC on copolymer film surfaces as miniaturized and wearable biosensors for various diagnostic and defense applications.

AB  - Skin-like ionogels have attracted much attention in artificial electronic skins and wearable sensors. However, it is challenging to develop ionogel-based multifunctional sensors that exhibit favorable durability, high sensitivity, and multisignal detection capability in diverse application environments. Herein, a mechanically durable, highly stretchable, and ultra-sensitive micronanostructured ionogel-based i-skin (MIS) with biomimetic hierarchical structures is fabricated. Moreover, with the highly conductive MIS as an ionic conductive layer, a MIS-based sensor with excellent superhydrophobicity has been developed by sandwiching the MIS film between two layers of acrylic elastomer film. By virtue of the well-designed surface structure and ingenious combination of various fascinating functions, the resultant MIS sensor features prominent sensing performance, including a wide sensing range of strain (0.1-400%), pressure (0.001-15 kPa), and temperature (25-95 degrees C), an ultralow detection limit (0.1% strain and 0.001 kPa pressure), a rapid response (67 ms), and ultra-durable stability (over 10 000 uninterrupted strain or compression cycles), showing competitive and even superior comprehensive performance to those of the existing ionogel sensors. Significantly, the versatile MIS sensor can not only be applied in wearable movement monitoring, multi-signal detection, and high-precision written stroke recognition, but is also capable of detecting subtle underwater vibrations caused by liquid drops or waves, a robotic fish, or human action, demonstrating its greater potential for diverse applications such as human health monitoring, human-machine interaction, marine environmental protection and biological research.

AB  - End-effector-based robotic systems provide easy-to-set-up motion support in rehabilitation of stroke and spinal-cord-injured patients. However, measurement information is obtained only about the motion of the limb segments to which the systems are attached and not about the adjacent limb segments. We demonstrate in one particular experimental setup that this limitation can be overcome by augmenting an end-effector-based robot with a wearable inertial sensor. Most existing inertial motion tracking approaches rely on a homogeneous magnetic field and thus fail in indoor environments and near ferromagnetic materials and electronic devices. In contrast, we propose a magnetometer-free sensor fusion method. It uses a quaternion-based algorithm to track the heading of a limb segment in real time by combining the gyroscope and accelerometer readings with position measurements of one point along that segment. We apply this method to an upper-limb rehabilitation robotics use case in which the orientation and position of the forearm and elbow are known, and the orientation and position of the upper arm and shoulder are estimated by the proposed method using an inertial sensor worn on the upper arm. Experimental data from five healthy subjects who performed 282 proper executions of a typical rehabilitation motion and 163 executions with compensation motion are evaluated. Using a camera-based system as a ground truth, we demonstrate that the shoulder position and the elbow angle are tracked with median errors around 4 cm and 4 degrees, respectively; and that undesirable compensatory shoulder movements, which were defined as shoulder displacements greater +/- 10 cm for more than 20% of a motion cycle, are detected and classified 100% correctly across all 445 performed motions. The results indicate that wearable inertial sensors and end-effector-based robots can be combined to provide means for effective rehabilitation therapy with likewise detailed and accurate motion tracking for performance assessment, real-time biofeedback and feedback control of robotic and neuroprosthetic motion support.

AB  - BackgroundNumerous experimental results have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in biological processes, as well as outbreaks of diseases at the molecular level. Despite their important role in biological processes, knowledge regarding specific functions of miRNAs in the development of human diseases is very limited. While attempting to solve this problem, many computational approaches have been proposed and attracted significant attention. However, most previous approaches suffer from the common problem of being inapplicable to new diseases without any known miRNA-disease associations.ResultsThis paper proposes a novel method for inferring disease-miRNA associations utilizing a machine learning technique called matrix factorization, which is widely used in recommendation systems. In recommendation systems, the goal is to predict rating scores that a user might assign to specific items. By replacing users with miRNAs and items with diseases, we can efficiently predict miRNA-disease associations without seed miRNAs. As a result, our proposed model, called prediction of microRNA-disease association utilizing a matrix completion approach, achieves excellent performance compared to previous approaches with a reliable AUC value of 0.882 by implementing five-fold cross validation.ConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, the proposed method applies the matrix completion technique to infer miRNA-disease associations and overcome the seed-miRNA problem negatively affects existing computational models.

AB  - Foot and ankle disabilities (foot drop) due to common peroneal nerve palsy and stroke negatively affect patients' ambulation and activities of daily living. We developed a novel robotics ankle hybrid assistive limb (HAL) for patients with foot drop due to common peroneal nerve palsy or stroke. The ankle HAL is a wearable exoskeleton-type robot that is used to train plantar and dorsiflexion and for voluntary assistive training of the ankle joint of patients with palsy using an actuator, which is placed on the lateral side of the ankle joint and detects bioelectrical signals from the tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius muscles. Voluntary ankle dorsiflexion training using the new ankle HAL was implemented in a patient with foot drop due to peroneal nerve palsy after lumbar surgery. The time required for ankle HAL training (from wearing to the end of training) was approximately 30 min per session. The muscle activities of the TA on the right were lower than those on the left before and after ankle HAL training. The electromyographic wave of muscle activities of the TA on the right was slightly clearer than that before ankle HAL training in the resting position immediately after ankle dorsiflexion. Voluntary ankle dorsiflexion training using the novel robotics ankle HAL was safe and had no adverse effect in a patient with foot drop due to peroneal nerve palsy.

AB  - Elevated intracranial fluid volume can drive intracranial pressure increases, which can potentially result in numerous neurological complications or death. This study's focus was to develop a passive skin patch sensor for the head that would non-invasively measure cranial fluid volume shifts. The sensor consists of a single baseline component configured into a rectangular planar spiral with a self-resonant frequency response when impinged upon by external radio frequency sweeps. Fluid volume changes (10 mL increments) were detected through cranial bone using the sensor on a dry human skull model. Preliminary human tests utilized two sensors to determine feasibility of detecting fluid volume shifts in the complex environment of the human body. The correlation between fluid volume changes and shifts in the first resonance frequency using the dry human skull was classified as a second order polynomial with R-2 = 0.97. During preliminary and secondary human tests, a approximate to 24 MHz and an average of approximate to 45.07 MHz shifts in the principal resonant frequency were measured respectively, corresponding to the induced cephalad bio-fluid shifts. This electromagnetic resonant sensor may provide a non-invasive method to monitor shifts in fluid volume and assist with medical scenarios including stroke, cerebral hemorrhage, concussion, or monitoring intracranial pressure.

AB  - Objective: To report the use of two techniques (radiosurgery and en bloc vertebrectomy) on the same patient for the treatment of two metastases in different sites of the spine arising from intracranial hemangiopericytoma. Intracranial hemangiopericytomas are rare, comprising approximately 2.4% of meningeal tumors and <1% of all tumors of the central nervous system. Metastases to the spine are even rarer: The largest case series reported in the literature has 5 and 7 cases. Methods: A 37-year-old man diagnosed with intracranial hemangiopericytoma was referred for a metastatic lesion in T12 and underwent en bloc resection using the Tomita technique. Results: The disease evolved with a metastasis to T2 treated by radiosurgery with 1600 cGy. The patient died 1,706 days after the en bloc resection of T12 and 1324 days after the radiosurgery of T2, and no recurrence occurred in these locations due to progression of the systemic diseases (liver and central nervous system). Conclusion: This is the first case reported in the literature in which two different techniques were used to treat metastatic lesions in the spine from an intracranial hemangiopericytoma and is unique for its use of two treatments in the same patient.

AB  - Video observations have been widely used for providing ground truth for wearable systems for monitoring food intake in controlled laboratory conditions; however, video observation requires participants be confined to a defined space. The purpose of this analysis was to test an alternative approach for establishing activity types and food intake bouts in a relatively unconstrained environment. The accuracy of a wearable system for assessing food intake was compared with that from video observation, and inter-rater reliability of annotation was also evaluated. Forty participants were enrolled. Multiple participants were simultaneously monitored in a 4-bedroom apartment using six cameras for three days each. Participants could leave the apartment overnight and for short periods of time during the day, during which time monitoring did not take place. A wearable system (Automatic Ingestion Monitor, AIM) was used to detect and monitor participants' food intake at a resolution of 30 s using a neural network classifier. Two different food intake detection models were tested, one trained on the data from an earlier study and the other on current study data using leave-one-out cross validation. Three trained human raters annotated the videos for major activities of daily living including eating, drinking, resting, walking, and talking. They further annotated individual bites and chewing bouts for each food intake bout. Results for inter-rater reliability showed that, for activity annotation, the raters achieved an average (+/- standard deviation (STD)) kappa value of 0.74 (+/- 0.02) and for food intake annotation the average kappa (Light's kappa) of 0.82 (+/- 0.04). Validity results showed that AIM food intake detection matched human video-annotated food intake with a kappa of 0.77 (+/- 0.10) and 0.78 (+/- 0.12) for activity annotation and for food intake bout annotation, respectively. Results of one-way ANOVA suggest that there are no statistically significant differences among the average eating duration estimated from raters' annotations and AIM predictions (p-value = 0.19). These results suggest that the AIM provides accuracy comparable to video observation and may be used to reliably detect food intake in multi-day observational studies.

AB  - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a severe complication of diabetes mellitus with potentially fatal consequences, is characterized by hyperglycemia and metabolic acidosis due to the accumulation of ketone bodies, which requires people with diabetes to monitor both glucose and ketone bodies. However, despite major advances in diabetes management mainly since the emergence of new-generation continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices capable of in vivo monitoring of glucose directly in the interstitial fluid (ISF), the continuous monitoring of ketone bodies is yet to be addressed. Here, we present the first use of a real-time continuous ketone bodies monitoring (CKM) microneedle platform. The system is based on the electrochemical monitoring of beta-hydroxybutyrate (HB) as the dominant biomarker of ketone formation. Such real-time HB detection has been realized using the beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (HBD) enzymatic reaction and by addressing the major challenges associated with the stable confinement of the enzyme/cofactor couple (HBD/NAD(+)) and with a stable and selective low-potential fouling-free anodic detection of NADH. The resulting CKM microneedle device displays an attractive analytical performance, with high sensitivity (with low detection limit, 50 mu M), high selectivity in the presence of potential interferences, along with good stability during prolonged operation in artificial ISF. The potential applicability of this microneedle sensor toward minimally invasive monitoring of ketone bodies has been demonstrated in a phantom gel skin-mimicking model. The ability to detect HB along with glucose and lactate on a single microneedle array has been demonstrated. These findings pave the way for CKM and for the simultaneous microneedle-based monitoring of multiple diabetes-related biomarkers toward a tight glycemic control.

   Aim We sought to determine whether a watch measuring wrist temperature could accurately identify patients who are infected.
   Methods Prospective cross-sectional pilot study of temperature monitoring in an unselected patients in a tertiary referral adult nephrology unit.
   Results One hundred and four data recording sessions revealed 88 useful data sets, with recording failures in the others. Patients were retrospectively classified as having no infection (Group A, n = 60), clinically diagnosed infection with less than 24 h of treatment with antibiotics (Group B, n = 5), and clinically diagnosed infection with greater than 24 h on antibiotics (Group C, n = 23). There was a significantly higher average maximum temperature in Group B (mean (SEM)) 38 degrees C (0.6) compared with Groups A (36.1 degrees C (0.1)) and C (36.3 degrees C (0.3)). Based on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) a cut-off temperature of >= 37.5 degrees C gave sensitivity 80% and specificity 98%. Mean electrodermal activity was significantly higher in Groups B and C.
   Conclusions ROC of peripheral skin temperature measurements suggest that such a device may identify many patients requiring treatment for infection. This proof of principle study showed value in using a wearable device in the detection of infection and its potential as an early warning or monitoring device.

AB  - Real-time motion capture of the human arm in the home environment has many use cases, such as video game and therapy applications. The required tracking can be based on off-the-shelf Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) with integrated three-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. However, this usually requires a homogeneous magnetic field to correct for orientation drift, which is often not available inside buildings. In this paper, RPMC (Rest Pose Magnetometer-based drift Correction), a novel method that is robust to long term drift in environments with inhomogeneous magnetic fields, is presented. The sensor orientation is estimated by integrating the angular velocity measured by the gyroscope and correcting drift around the pitch and roll axes with the acceleration information. This commonly leads to short term drift around the gravitational axis. Here, during the calibration phase, the local magnetic field direction for each sensor, and its orientation relative to the inertial frame, are recorded in a rest pose. It is assumed that arm movements in free space are exhausting and require regular rest. A set of rules is used to detect when the user has returned to the rest pose, to then correct for the drift that has occurred with the magnetometer. Optical validations demonstrated accurate (root mean square error RMS=6.1 degrees), low latency (61ms tracking of the user's wrist orientation, in real time, for a full hour of arm movements. The reduction in error relative to three alternative methods implemented for comparison was between 82.5% and 90.7% for the same movement and environment. Therefore, the proposed arm tracking method allows for the correction of orientation drift in an inhomogeneous magnetic field by exploiting the user's need for frequent rest.

AB  - A silk fibroin-encapsulated graphene field effect transistor (FET) enzymatic biosensor that utilizes silk protein as both device substrate and enzyme immobilization material was developed for glucose detection. This biosensor detected glucose levels by measuring the differential drain-source current and the Dirac point shift of the graphene transistor as the glucose is oxidized by glucose oxidase that was immobilized in silk fibroin film on the graphene FET. The fabricated biosensors showed 0.1-10 mM large linear detection range, which covers the reference range of medical examination for diabetes diagnostics. The detection limit of the fabricated biosensors was approximately 0.1 mM (S/N= 3) with excellent selectivity, and the average sensitivity was 2.5 mu A/mM measured at V-ds = 100 mV and V-g = 0V. Because this fibroin-encapsulated graphene FET enzymatic biosensor is biocompatible, flexible, and long-term stable, it holds a great promise for portable, wearable, and implantable continuous glucose monitoring applications.

AB  - In the early 2000s, data from the latest World Health Organization estimates paint a picture where one-seventh of the world population needs at least one assistive device. Fortunately, these years are also characterized by a marked technological drive which takes the name of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this terrain, robotics is making its way through more and more aspects of everyday life, and robotics-based assistance/rehabilitation is considered one of the most encouraging applications. Providing high-intensity rehabilitation sessions or home assistance through low-cost robotic devices can be indeed an effective solution to democratize services otherwise not accessible to everyone. However, the identification of an intuitive and reliable real-time control system does arise as one of the critical issues to unravel for this technology in order to land in homes or clinics. Intention recognition techniques from surface ElectroMyoGraphic (sEMG) signals are referred to as one of the main ways-to-go in literature. Nevertheless, even if widely studied, the implementation of such procedures to real-case scenarios is still rarely addressed. In a previous work, the development and implementation of a novel sEMG-based classification strategy to control a fully-wearable Hand Exoskeleton System (HES) have been qualitatively assessed by the authors. This paper aims to furtherly demonstrate the validity of such a classification strategy by giving quantitative evidence about the favourable comparison to some of the standard machine-learning-based methods. Real-time action, computational lightness, and suitability to embedded electronics will emerge as the major characteristics of all the investigated techniques.

AB  - Electrocardiogram (ECG) and Photoplethysmogram (PPG) are derived from electrical signals of the heart activities and frequently used to diagnose and monitor cardiovascular disease. In the field of affective computing, these two signals can be used to recognize human emotions, this is supported by the wide availability of wearable devices that able to collect ECG or PPG in the market. ECG is frequently used as a unimodal signal for ERS, but the usage of PPG signals as unimodal ERS is still limited. There is no consensus about whether ECG is more suitable than PPG in ERS or vice versa. Only a few research have compared ECG and PPG. Therefore, this work intends to close this gap by developing an ERS employing ECG and PPG and evaluating the efficacy of both signals in ERS. This is done through data collected from 47 participants and two public datasets. The result from the data collected indicates that ECG is superior at recognizing arousal emotion with accuracy up to 68.75%, whereas PPG superior at recognizing valence up to 64.94% and dimension classes with 37.01% accuracy. The findings suggest that despite the current trend where researchers favour ECG over PPG, the PPG signals can be used as the only modality in developing ERS with results comparable to those obtained using ECG signals.(c) 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Big data analytics is one of the state-of-the-art tools to optimize networks and transform them from merely being a blind tube that conveys data, into a cognitive, conscious, and self-optimizing entity that can intelligently adapt according to the needs of its users. This, in fact, can be regarded as one of the highest forthcoming priorities of future networks. In this paper, we propose a system for Out-Patient (OP) centric Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) network optimization. Big data harvested from the OPs' medical records, along with current readings from their body-connected medical IoT sensors are processed and analyzed to predict the likelihood of a life-threatening medical condition, for instance, an imminent stroke. This prediction is used to ensure that the OP is assigned an optimal LTE-A Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) to transmit their critical data to their healthcare provider with minimal delay. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time big data analytics are utilized to optimize a cellular network in an OP-conscious manner. The PRBs assignment is optimized using Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and a real-time heuristic. Two approaches are proposed, the Weighted Sum Rate Maximization (WSRMax) approach and the Proportional Fairness (PF) approach. The approaches increased the OPs' average SINR by 26.6% and 40.5%, respectively. The WSRMax approach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, however, the PF approach reported higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin of error.

AB  - Radon gas has been declared a human carcinogen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Several studies carried out in Spain highlighted the high radon concentrations in several regions, with Galicia (northwestern Spain) being one of the regions with the highest radon concentrations. The objective of this work was to create a safe and low-cost radon monitoring and alert system, based on open source technologies. To achieve this objective, the system uses devices, a collection of sensors with a processing unit and a communication module, and a backend, responsible for managing all the information, predicting radon levels and issuing alerts using open source technologies. Security is one of the largest challenges for the internet of things, and it is utterly important in the current scenario, given that high radon concentrations pose a health risk. For this reason, this work focuses on securing the entire end-to-end communication path to avoid data forging. The results of this work indicate that the development of a low-cost, yet secured, radon monitoring system is feasible, allowing one to create a network of sensors that can help mitigate the health hazards that high radon concentrations pose.

AB  - Brain health attracts more recent attention as the population ages. Smartphone-based gait sensing and analysis can help identify the risks of brain diseases in daily life for prevention. Existing gait analysis approaches mainly hand-craft temporal gait features or developing CNN-based feature extractors, but they are either prone to lose some inconspicuous pathological information or are only dedicated to a single brain disease screening. We discover that the relationship between gait segments can be used as a principle and generic indicator to quantify multiple pathological patterns. In this paper, we propose NeuralGait, a pervasive smartphone-cloud system that passively captures and analyzes principle gait segments relationship for brain health assessment. On the smartphone end, inertial gait data are collected while putting the smartphone in the pants pocket. We then craft local temporal-frequent gait domain features and develop a self-attention-based gait segment relationship encoder. Afterward, the domain features and relation features are fed to a scalable RiskNet in the cloud for brain health assessment. We also design a pathological hot update protocol to efficiently add new brain diseases in the RiskNet. NeuralGait is practical as it provides brain health assessment with no burden in daily life. In the experiment, we recruit 988 healthy people and 417 patients with a single or combination of PD, TBI, and stroke, and evaluate the brain health assessment using a set of specifically designed metrics including global accuracy, exact accuracy, sensitivity, and false alarm rate. We also demonstrate the generalization (e.g., analysis of feature effectiveness and model efficiency) and inclusiveness of NeuralGait.

AB  - Forefoot load (FL) contributes to callus formation, which is one of the pathways to diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). In this study, we hypothesized that excessive FL, which cannot be detected by plantar load measurements within laboratory settings, occurs in daily walks. To demonstrate this, we created a FL estimation algorithm using foot motion data. Acceleration and angular velocity data were obtained from a motion sensor attached to each shoe of the subjects. The accuracy of the estimated FL was validated by correlation with the FL measured by force sensors on the metatarsal heads, which was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The mean of correlation coefficients of all the subjects was 0.63 at a level corridor, while it showed an intersubject difference at a slope and stairs. We conducted daily walk measurements in two diabetic patients, and additionally, we verified the safety of daily walk measurement using a wearable motion sensor attached to each shoe. We found that excessive FL occurred during their daily walks for approximately three hours in total, when any adverse event was not observed. This study indicated that FL evaluation method using wearable motion sensors was one of the promising ways to prevent DFUs.

AB  - Antenna is used as a sensor in wearable technology because of its small size. Reduced flexible antenna size avoids mounting problems and crumbling effects on the human skin region during signal acquisition. Moreover, continuous diabetes monitoring needs an efficient antenna sensor design. In this article, we develop a continuous glucose monitoring device using a flexible antenna sensor planted inside the thumb spica splint glove. The flexible antenna sensor comprises polyimide substrate with ?r = 3.5, tand = 0.0027, and a thickness of 0.1 mm. The proposed flexible antenna sensor senses dielectric radiations from glucose in the blood and improves the accuracy of glucose-level prediction. Traditional antenna sensor methods use skin layers and muscles as sources of permittivity, resulting in errors in diabetic value measurement. The acquired antenna sensor signal from the designed thumb spica splint glove is processed using the tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT) algorithm. It differentiates the dielectric properties of glucose in the blood, skin, and muscle through subband energy levels. The subband energy level of glucose from the proposed antenna sensor and the quadratic regression algorithm is used to predict the human glucose level. The predicted glucose levels using the proposed flexible antenna are validated through Accu-Chek Active Glucometer. From experimental results, the proposed method-based glucose prediction-level accuracy achieved about 96.8% compared to traditional methods.

AB  - In many areas of the world accessing professional physicians "when needed/as needed'' might not be always possible for a variety of reasons. Therefore, in such cases, a targeted e-Health solution to safeguard patient long-term health could be a meaningful approach. Today's modern healthcare technologies, often built around electronic and computer-based equipment, require an access to a reliable electricity supply. Many healthcare technologies and products also presume access to the high speed internet is available, making them unsuitable for use in areas where there is no fixed-line internet connectivity, access is slow, unreliable, and expensive, yet where the most benefit to patients may be gained. In this paper, a full mobile sensor platform is presented, based around readily-purchased consumer components, to facilitate a low cost and efficient means of monitoring the health of patients with prosthetic lower limbs. This platform is designed such that it can also be operated in a standalone mode, i.e., in the absence of internet connectivity, thereby making it suitable to the developing world. Also, to counter the challenge of power supply issues in e-Health monitoring, a self-contained rechargeable solution to the platform is proposed and demonstrated. The platform works with an Android mobile device, in order to allow for the capture of data from a wireless sensor unit, and to give the clinician access to results from the sensors. The results from the analysis, carried out within the platform's Raspberry Pi Zero, are demonstrated to be of use for remote monitoring. This is specifically targeted for monitoring the tissue health of lower limb amputees. The monitoring of residual limb temperature and gait can be a useful indicator of tissue viability in lower limb amputees especially those suffering from diabetes. We describe a route wherein non-invasive monitoring of tissue health is achievable using the Gaussian process technique. This knowledge will be useful in establishing biomarkers related to a possible deterioration in a patient's health or for assessing the impact of clinical interventions.

AB  - Diabetes has become a prominent issue that threatens human's health. Minimally invasive blood glucose testing may cause inconvenience and pain to patients. Wearable non-invasive blood glucose testing is becoming a hot topic in the scientific and medical field. In this study, novel palladium. silver nanowires (Pd. AgNWs) flexible electrodes were prepared by electrochemical deposition of Pd nanoparticles on the electrode with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the substrate and AgNWs as the conductive layer. The nanoparticles were uniformly deposited on AgNWs and different Pd. AgNWs electrodes were made by changing Pd deposition cycles. By using them as the working electrodes, glucose was detected by cyclic voltammetry. It was found that the Pd-AgNWs electrode deposited with 25 cycles of palladium had the best results in the detection of glucose. The experimental conditions of glucose detection were optimized. The linear ranges of glucose were 0.02-0.5 mmol/L and 1-4 mmol/L when detecting glucose by current.time method. The detection limit was 1 mu mol/L and the response sensitivity was 33.18 mu A/(cm(2)(mmol/L)) (S/N = 3). This electrode exhibited good reproducibility, stability, selectivity, as well as good response in detection of salivary glucose.

AB  - Objective. Autonomic nervous system function and thereby bodily stress and recovery reactions may be assessed by wearable devices measuring heart rate (HR) and its variability (HRV). So far, the validity of HRV-based stress assessments has been mainly studied in healthy populations. In this study, we determined how psychosocial stress affects physiological and psychological stress responses in both young (18-30 years) and middle-aged (45-64 years) healthy individuals as well as in patients with arterial hypertension and/or either prior evidence of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. We also studied how an HRV-based stress index (Relax-Stress Intensity, RSI) relates to perceived stress (PS) and cortisol (CRT) responses during psychosocial stress. Approach. A total of 197 participants were divided into three groups: (1) healthy young (HY, N = 63), (2) healthy middle-aged (HM, N = 61) and (3) patients with cardiometabolic risk factors (Pts, N = 73, 32-65 years). The participants underwent a group version of Trier Social Stress Test (TSST-G). HR, HRV (quantified as root mean square of successive differences of R-R intervals, RMSSD), RSI, PS, and salivary CRT were measured regularly during TSST-G and a subsequent recovery period. Main results. All groups showed significant stress reactions during TSST-G as indicated by significant responses of HR, RMSSD, RSI, PS, and salivary CRT. Between-group differences were also observed in all measures. Correlation and regression analyses implied RSI being the strongest predictor of CRT response, while HR was more closely associated with PS. Significance. The HRV-based stress index mirrors responses of CRT, which is an independent marker for physiological stress, around TSST-G. Thus, the HRV-based stress index may be used to quantify physiological responses to psychosocial stress across various health and age groups.

AB  - Purpose: It is critical to determine the risk factors for activities of daily living (ADL) disability caused by loco motor dysfunction. However, no longitudinal study has investigated the association between disability due to locomotive dysfunction and multidimensional factors. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between the progression of functional capacity decline due to locomotive dysfunction and multiple physical functions among older adults in a longitudinal study. Methods: The participants comprised of 433 community-dwelling older adults. Physical function was assessed at baseline, which included handgrip strength, maximal isometric strength of hip flexion, hip extension, hip abduction, knee extension, toe flexion (index for muscle strength), the 5-time chair-stand test (index for muscle power), the one-legged stance and timed "Up & Go" tests (index for balance function), the 30-s stair test (index for muscle endurance), and range of motion (ROM) (an index of joint condition). Functional capacity decline due to locomotive dysfunction was assessed using the 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale (GLFS-25) before and after a 12-month period. Based on changes in the GLFS-25 score compared with baseline, the non decline and decline groups were operationally defined. Logistic regression analyses with the groups as the dependent variable and physical function as independent variables were performed. Results: Of the 433 participants, 189 (43.6%) were included in the decline group. Logistic regression analysis revealed hip flexor strength as a primary determinant in the progression of functional capacity decline. Conclusion: These results suggest that among physical functions, hip flexor strength influences the progression of disability resulting from locomotive dysfunction in older adults.

AB  - Background Since COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) was discovered in December 2019, it has spread worldwide. Early isolation and medical observation management of cases and their close contacts are the key to controlling the spread of the epidemic. However, traditional medical observation requires medical staff to measure body temperature and other vital signs face to face and record them manually. There is a general shortage of human and personal protective equipment and a high risk of occupational exposure, which seriously threaten the safety of medical staff.
   Methods We designed an intelligent crowd isolation medical observation management system framework based on the Internet of Things using wireless telemetry and big data cloud platform remote management technology. Through a smart wearable device with built-in sensors, vital sign data and geographical locations of medical observation subjects are collected and automatically uploaded to the big data monitoring platform on demand. According to the comprehensive analysis of the set threshold parameters, abnormal subjects are screened out, and activity tracking and health status monitoring for medical observation and management objectives are performed through monitoring and early warning management and post-event data traceability. In the trial of this system, the subjects wore the wristwatches designed in this study and real-time monitoring was conducted throughout the whole process. Additionally, for comparison, the traditional method was also used for these people. Medical staff came to measure their temperature twice a day. The subjects were 1,128 returned overseas Chinese from Europe.
   Results Compared with the traditional vital sign detection method, the system designed in this study has the advantages of a fast response, low error, stability, and good endurance. It can monitor the temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and heart rate of the monitored subject in real time. The system designed in this study and the traditional vital sign detection method were both used to monitor 1,128 close contacts with COVID-19. There were six cases of abnormal body temperature that were missed by traditional manual temperature measurement in the morning and evening, and these six cases (0.53%) were sent to the hospital for further diagnosis. The abnormal body temperature of these six cases was not found in time when the medical staff came to check the temperature on a twice-a-day basis. The system designed in this study, however, can detect the abnormal body temperature of all these six people. The sensitivity and specificity of our system were both 100%.
   Conclusion The system designed in this study can monitor the body temperature, blood oxygen, blood pressure, heart rate, and geographical location of the monitoring subject in real time. It can be extended to COVID-19 medical observation isolation points, shelter hospitals, infectious disease wards, and nursing homes.

AB  - Wearable wireless electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is well-proven for arrythmia detection, but ischemia detection accuracy is not well-described. We aimed to assess the agreement of ST-segment deviation from single- versus 12-lead ECG and their accuracy for the detection of reversible ischemia. Bias and limits of agreement (LoA) were calculated between maximum deviations in ST segments from single- and 12-lead ECG during Rb-82 PET-myocardial cardiac stress scintigraphy. Sensitivity and specificity for reversible anterior-lateral myocardial ischemia detection were assessed for both ECG methods, using perfusion imaging results as a reference. Out of 110 patients included, 93 were analyzed. The maximum difference between single- and 12-lead ECG was seen in II (-0.019 mV). The widest LoA was seen in V5, with an upper LoA of 0.145 mV (0.118 to 0.172) and a lower LoA of -0.155 mV (-0.182 to -0.128). Ischemia was seen in 24 patients. Single-lead and 12-lead ECG both had poor accuracy for the detection of reversible anterolateral ischemia during the test: single-lead ECG had a sensitivity of 8.3% (1.0-27.0%) and specificity of 89.9% (80.2-95.8%), and 12-lead ECG a sensitivity of 12.5% (3.0-34.4%) and a specificity of 91.3% (82.0-96.7%). In conclusion, agreement was within predefined acceptable criteria for ST deviations, and both methods had high specificity but poor sensitivity for the detection of anterolateral reversible ischemia. Additional studies must confirm these results and their clinical relevance, especially in the light of the poor sensitivity for detecting reversible anterolateral cardiac ischemia.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) is an irritant gas with a unique pungent odor; sub-parts per million-level breath ammonia is a medical biomarker for kidney disorders and Helicobacter pylon bacteria-induced stomach infections. The humidity varies in both ambient environment and exhaled breath, and thus humidity dependence of gas-sensing characteristics is a great obstacle for real-time applications. Herein, flexible, humidity-independent, and room-temperature ammonia sensors are fabricated by the thermal evaporation of CuBr on a polyimide substrate and subsequent coating of a nanoscale moisture-blocking CeO2 overlayer by electron beam evaporation. CuBr sensors coated with a 100 nm-thick CeO2 overlayer exhibits an ultrahigh response (resistance ratio) of 68 toward 5 ppm ammonia with excellent gas selectivity, rapid response, reversibility, and humidity-independent sensing characteristics at room temperature. In addition, the sensing performance remains stable after repetitive bending and long-term operation. Moreover, the sensors exhibit significant response to the simulated exhaled breath of patients with H. pylori infection; the simulated breath contains 50 ppb NH3. The sensors thus show promising potential in detecting sub-parts per million-level NH3, regardless of humidity fluctuations, which can open up new applications in wearable devices for in situ medical diagnosis and indoor/outdoor environment monitoring.

AB  - Mobile health technologies (wearable, portable, body-fixed sensors, or domestic-integrated devices) that quantify mobility in unsupervised, daily living environments are emerging as complementary clinical assessments. Data collected in these ecologically valid, patient-relevant settings can overcome limitations of conventional clinical assessments, as they capture fluctuating and rare events. These data could support clinical decision making and could also serve as outcomes in clinical trials. However, studies that directly compared assessments made in unsupervised and supervised (eg, in the laboratory or hospital) settings point to large disparities, even in the same parameters of mobility. These differences appear to be affected by psychological, physiological, cognitive, environmental, and technical factors, and by the types of mobilities and diagnoses assessed. To facilitate the successful adaptation of the unsupervised assessment of mobility into clinical practice and clinical trials, clinicians and researchers should consider these disparities and the multiple factors that contribute to them.

AB  - Wearable electronics with applications in healthcare, human-machine interfaces, and robotics often explore complex manufacturing procedures and are not disposable. Although the use of conductive pencil patterns on cellulose paper provides inexpensive, disposable sensors, they have limited stretchability and are easily affected by variations in the ambient environment. This work presents the combination of pencil-on-paper with the hydrophobic fumed SiO2 (Hf-SiO2) coating and stretchable kirigami structures from laser cutting to prepare a superhydrophobic, stretchable pencil-on-paper multifunctional sensing platform. The resulting sensor exhibits a large response to NO2 gas at elevated temperature from self-heating, which is minimally affected by the variations in the ambient temperature and relative humidity, as well as mechanical deformations such as bending and stretching states. The integrated temperature sensor and electrodes with the sensing platform can accurately detect temperature and electrophysiological signals to alert for adverse thermal effects and cardiopulmonary diseases. The thermal therapy and electrical stimulation provided by the platform can also deliver effective means to battle against inflammation/infection and treat chronic wounds. The superhydrophobic pencil-onpaper multifunctional device platform provides a low-cost, disposable solution to disease diagnostic confirmation and early treatment for personal and population health.

AB  - Understanding brain function using electroencephalography (EEG) is an important issue for cerebral nervous system diseases, especially for epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Many EEG measurement systems are used reliably to study these diseases, but their bulky size and the use of wet sensors make them uncomfortable and inconvenient for users. To overcome the limitations of conventional EEG measurement systems, a wireless and wearable multichannel EEG measurement system is proposed in this paper. This system includes a wireless data acquisition device, dry spring-loaded sensors, and a size-adjustable soft cap. We compared the performance of the proposed system using dry versus conventional wet sensors. A significant positive correlation between readings from wet and dry sensors was achieved, thus demonstrating the performance of the system. Moreover, four different features of EEG signals (i.e., normal, eye-blinking, closed-eyes, and teeth-clenching signals) were measured by 16 dry sensors to ensure that they could be detected in real-life cognitive neuroscience applications. Thus, we have shown that it is possible to reliably measure EEG signals using the proposed system. This paper presents novel insights into the field of cognitive neuroscience, showing the possibility of studying brain function under real-life conditions.

AB  - There have been numerous studies focusing on normal aging in previous decades which is accompanied by the structural and functional decline in the hippocampus, while the pattern of hippocampal alteration with age remains unclear. Figuring out the mechanism of hippocampal changes precisely is beneficial for a better understanding of the aging process. In this study, we included a total of 451 T1 MRI scans of subjects of age 50-90 who were labeled as normal in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Taking 10 years of age as an age band, we divided the subjects into four groups (denoted as HC1, HC2, HC3, and HC4, respectively), with the youngest being 50-60 and the oldest 81-90. Then the Multivariate Morphometry Statistics (MMS) of the hippocampus segmented from the four groups were extracted by surface reconstruction, mesh generation, and surface registration. Finally, the significant differences between the youngest group and the other three were statistically analyzed. Results showed that the earliest deformation region of the left hippocampus located in the frontal subiculum and the dorsal CA1 of the tail part and gradually expanded with aging, while the right hippocampal deformation mainly concentrated in the dorsal CA1 and spread to the posterior CA2-3, which occurred later than that of the left. All the results illustrated that the hippocampus is truly a vulnerable structure in the course of aging, and the MMS are sensitive metrics for detecting the changes in the subcortical convex structure.

AB  - The noninvasive fetal ECG (FECG) is used to monitor fetal well-being at prenatal and intrapartum. However, it is challenging to detect the FECG signal from the abdominal electrocardiogram (ECG) due to the following problems: 1) the FECG signal is weak and often masked by noise and 2) the FECG signal is mixed or overlapped with the maternal ECG (MECG) signal. To solve such problems, a period-aware attention network (PA(2)Net) is proposed for FECG detection by designing three modules, where an FECG period-aware attention module (FPAM), which is designed to suppress the noise interference by modeling the periods and features of signals, is first employed to detect FECG signals masked in noise; next, an MECG period-aware attention module, which is generated from the FPAM by the KL-divergence-based weight sharing module, can collaborate with the FPAM to search for mixed ECG signals of FECG and MECG. Finally, an antialiasing signal separation module is developed to estimate FECG signals from mixed ECG signals. Experiments conducted on the benchmarks show that the proposed PA(2)Net can achieve excellent performance with the PPV of 98.83%, 99.74%, 99.67%, and 98.47% on PCDB, ADFECGDB, NIFECGDB, and LHDB databases, respectively, allowing obstetricians to use PA(2)Net to monitor fetal health and diagnose diseases.

AB  - Background. The use of an exoskeleton elbow is considered an effective treatment in several pathologies, including post-stroke complications, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI), as well as in patients with neurodegenerative disorders. The effectiveness of rehabilitation is closely linked to a suitably chosen therapy. The treatment can be performed only by specialized personnel, significantly supported with the use of automated devices.
   Objectives. The aim of this study was to present a novel exoskeleton for elbow rehabilitation without a complicated control system.
   Material and methods. Single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) solution in constructing the prototype of an elbow exoskeleton for rehabilitation purposes has been applied. The simplicity of the actuation mechanism was set as one of the priorities in the design; thus, a single-axis stepper motor with a controller was found to be adequate for providing a reliable and precise source of motion for the exoskeleton.
   Results. Technological development may provide novel solutions, such as an exoskeleton - a wearable, external structure which supports or (in selected applications) even replaces the muscle actuation in the patient. The reported advantages of the proposed exoskeleton reflect current state-of-the-art. The proposed control strategy relies on closed-loop position control, performance, low manufacturing cost, and predicted performance in a rehabilitation scenario. All these factors play an important role in establishing the directions for further research, e.g., an integrated force sensor in the device, measurements of torque interactions on the elbow joint, and assessment and response to an overload of articulation.
   Conclusions. This study suggests not only the clinical but also the possible economic and logistical advantages offered by the portability of the system, and its effective support for therapists applying an elbow exoskeleton.

AB  - Background: The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus, COVID-19), declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), is a global health problem with ever-increasing attributed deaths. Vital sign trends are routinely used to monitor patients with changes in these parameters often preceding an adverse event. Wearable sensors can measure vital signs continuously (e.g. heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature) remotely and can be utilised to recognise early clinical deterioration.
   Methods: We describe the protocol for a pilot, proof-of-concept, observational study to be conducted in an engineered hotel near London airports, UK. The study is set to continue for the duration of the pandemic. Individuals arriving to London with mild symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 or returning from high-risk areas requiring quarantine, as recommended by the Public Health England, or healthcare professionals with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 unable to isolate at home will be eligible for a wearable patch to be applied for the duration of their stay. Notifications will be generated should deterioration be detected through the sensor and displayed on a central monitoring hub viewed by nursing staff, allowing for trend deterioration to be noted. The primary objective is to determine the feasibility of remote monitoring systems in detecting clinical deterioration for quarantined individuals in a hotel.
   Discussion: This trial should prove the feasibility of a rapidly implemented model of healthcare delivery through remote monitoring during a global pandemic at a hotel, acting as an extension to a healthcare trust. Potential benefits would include reducing infection risk of COVID-19 to healthcare staff, with earlier recognition of clinical deterioration through ambulatory, continuous, remote monitoring using a discrete wearable sensor. We hope our results can power future, robust randomised trials.

AB  - Cancer patients assigned for abdominal surgery are often given exercise programmes (prehabilitation) prior to surgery, which aim to improve fitness in order to reduce pre-operative risk. However, only a small proportion of patients are able to partake in supervised hospital-based prehabilitation because of inaccessibility and a lack of resources, which often makes it difficult for health professionals to accurately monitor and provide feedback on exercise and activity levels. The development of a simple tool to detect the type and intensity of physical activity undertaken outside the hospital setting would be beneficial to both patients and clinicians. This paper aims to describe the key exercises of a prehabilitation programme and to determine whether the types and intensity of various prehabilitation exercises could be accurately identified using Fourier analysis of 3D accelerometer sensor data. A wearable sensor with an inbuilt 3D accelerometer was placed on both the ankle and wrist of five volunteer participants during nine prehabilitation exercises which were performed at low to high intensity. Here, the 3D accelerometer data are analysed using fast Fourier analysis, where the dominant frequency and amplitude components are extracted for each activity performed at low, moderate, and high intensity. The findings indicate that the 3D accelerometer located at the ankle is suitable for detecting activities such as cycling and rowing at low, moderate, and high exercise intensities. However, there is some overlap in the frequency and acceleration amplitude components for overland and treadmill walking at a moderate intensity.

AB  - Recent advances in wireless communication technologies are having a great impact on people's life, especially in the field of healthcare industry that provides a remote monitoring enabling medical staff to follow up the patient and diagnose his disease. LoRa wireless technology is becoming one of the most energetic effective solutions for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) communications. In this work, we propose a LoRa-based low power healthcare WBAN platform called HeaLoRa for an adaptive patient monitoring process. Physicians can remotely monitor patient's temperature, oxygen saturation level, blood pressure and heart rate to prevent any abnormality. Moreover, data acquisition and transmission are controlled based on a power consumption optimization strategy aiming to reduce redundant data. Based on the Early Warning Score (EWS), the system configuration is dynamically adapted, using a Fuzzy logic controller that makes the decision about the system sleep mode duration and the sent data rate. Furthermore, an analytical model of the energy consumption for acknowledged LoRa transmission is presented in this paper. The graphical abstract of the paper illustrates a medical application of a wireless body area network system where LoRa technology is used to transmit the data to a gateway then the data is transmitted to the doctor using IP based technology. By comparing with a reference system, the simulation results indicate that our system consumes 3 to 10 times less of energy depending on the studied scenario.

AB  - We present the development of a novel smart ink pen instrumented with force and motion sensors designed for the quantitative and ecological assessment of daily-life handwriting. This work aims at testing the pen's sensors and algorithms and the use of the smartpen to detect age-related changes in writing and tremor parameters during daily-life handwriting. A comparison against reference instruments was carried out to validate the pen tip force during static and dynamic conditions, the pen's tilt angle, and the algorithm for the segmentation of the force signal into strokes. The smartpen was tested on 43 healthy adults divided into three age groups (young, middle-old, and old) during unconstrained handwriting on paper. The validation of the pen's sensors and algorithms reported excellent results. A solid test-retest reliability was found in the writing and tremor indicators extracted from both young and old adults. As for the age-related analysis, the older age groups were characterized by an increase of temporal writing measures, a more uniform writing pressure, and more repetitive and predictable tremor oscillation components. The greatest accomplishment of our smart ink pen is the ability to combine the advantages of the digitizing tablet technology with the natural "feel," the ease of use, and the ecological validity of the traditional pen-and-paper approach. The proposed solution represents an important step toward a simple, ecologically valid, reliable quantitative assessment of daily-life handwriting. Our smartpen is particularly suitable for daily-life telemonitoring applications in a number of important health-related fields.

AB  - Exercise testing to assess the response to physical rehabilitation or lifestyle interventions is administered in clinics thus at best can be repeated only few times a year. This study explores a novel approach to collecting information on functional performance through walk tests, e.g., a 6-min walk test (6MWT), unintentionally performed in free-living activities. Walk tests are detected in step data provided by a wrist-worn device. Only those events of minute-to-minute variation in walking cadence, which is equal or lower than the empirically determined maximal SD (e.g., 5-steps), are considered as walk test candidates. Out of detected walk tests within the non-overlapping sliding time interval (e.g., 1-week), the one with the largest number of steps is chosen as the most representative. This approach is studied on a cohort of 99 subjects, assigned to the groups of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and healthy subjects below and over 40-years-old, who were asked to wear the device while maintaining their usual physical activity regimen. The total wear time was 8,864 subject-days after excluding the intervals of occasionally discontinued monitoring. About 82% (23/28) of patients with CVD and 88% (21/24) of healthy subjects over 40-years-old had at least a single 6MWT over the 1st month of monitoring. About 52% of patients with CVD (12/23) and 91% (19/21) of healthy subjects over 40-years-old exceeded 500 m. Patients with CVD, on average, walked 46 m shorter 6MWT distance (p = 0.04) compared to healthy subjects. Unintentional walk testing is feasible and could be valuable for repeated assessment of functional performance outside the clinical setting.

AB  - Due to the limited ability of conventional methods and the limited perspective of human diagnostics, patients are often diagnosed incorrectly or at a late stage as their disease condition progresses. They may then undergo unnecessary treatments due to inaccurate diagnoses. In this Perspective, we offer a brief overview on the integration of nanotechnology-based medical sensors and artificial intelligence (AI) for advanced clinical decision support systems to help decision-makers and healthcare systems improve how they approach information, insights, and the surrounding contexts, as well as to promote the uptake of personalized medicine on an individualized basis. Relying on these milestones, wearable sensing devices could enable interactive and evolving clinical decisions that could be used for evidence-based analysis and recommendations as well as for personalized monitoring of disease progress and treatment. We present and discuss the ongoing challenges and future opportunities associated with AI-enabled medical sensors in clinical decisions.

AB  - Background: MUNDUS is an assistive framework for recovering direct interaction capability of severely motor impaired people based on arm reaching and hand functions. It aims at achieving personalization, modularity and maximization of the user's direct involvement in assistive systems. To this, MUNDUS exploits any residual control of the end-user and can be adapted to the level of severity or to the progression of the disease allowing the user to voluntarily interact with the environment. MUNDUS target pathologies are high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurodegenerative and genetic neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia, and multiple sclerosis (MS). The system can be alternatively driven by residual voluntary muscular activation, head/eye motion, and brain signals. MUNDUS modularly combines an antigravity lightweight and non-cumbersome exoskeleton, closed-loop controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for arm and hand motion, and potentially a motorized hand orthosis, for grasping interactive objects.
   Methods: The definition of the requirements and of the interaction tasks were designed by a focus group with experts and a questionnaire with 36 potential end-users. Five end-users (3 SCI and 2 MS) tested the system in the configuration suitable to their specific level of impairment. They performed two exemplary tasks: reaching different points in the working volume and drinking. Three experts evaluated over a 3-level score (from 0, unsuccessful, to 2, completely functional) the execution of each assisted sub-action.
   Results: The functionality of all modules has been successfully demonstrated. User's intention was detected with a 100% success. Averaging all subjects and tasks, the minimum evaluation score obtained was 1.13 +/- 0.99 for the release of the handle during the drinking task, whilst all the other sub-actions achieved a mean value above 1.6. All users, but one, subjectively perceived the usefulness of the assistance and could easily control the system. Donning time ranged from 6 to 65 minutes, scaled on the configuration complexity.
   Conclusions: The MUNDUS platform provides functional assistance to daily life activities; the modules integration depends on the user's need, the functionality of the system have been demonstrated for all the possible configurations, and preliminary assessment of usability and acceptance is promising.

AB  - Advanced diagnosis systems provide doctors with an abundance of high-quality data, which allows for diagnosing dangerous diseases, such as brain cancers. Unfortunately, humans flooded with such plentiful information might overlook tumor symptoms. Hence, diagnostical devices are becoming more commonly combined with software systems, enhancing the decisioning process. This work picks up the subject of designing a neural network based system that allows for automatic brain tumor diagnosis from MRI images and points out important areas. The application intends to speed up the diagnosis and lower the risk of slipping up on a neoplastic lesion. The study based on two types of neural networks, Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers, aimed to assess the capabilities of the innovative ViT and its possible future evolution compared with well-known CNNs. The research reveals a tumor recognition rate as high as 90% with both architectures, while the Vision Transformer turned out to be easier to train and provided more detailed decision reasoning. The results show that computer-aided diagnosis and ViTs might be a significant part of modern medicine development in IoT and healthcare systems.

AB  - Multi-morbidity is the presence of two or more long-term health conditions, including defined physical or mental health conditions, such as diabetes or schizophrenia. One of the regular and critical health cases is an elderly person with a multi-morbid health condition and special complications who lives alone. These patients are typically not familiar with advanced Information and Communications Technology (ICT), but they are comfortable using smart devices such as wearable watches and mobile phones. The use of ICT improves medical quality, promotes patient security and data security, lowers operational and administrative costs, and gives the people in charge to make informed decisions. Additionally, the use of ICT in healthcare practices greatly reduces human errors, enhances clinical outcomes, ramps up care coordination, boosts practice efficiencies, and helps in collecting data over time. The proposed research concept provides a natural technique to implement preventive health care innovative solutions since several health sensors are embedded in devices that autonomously monitor the patients' health conditions in real-time. This enhances the elder's limited ability to predict and respond to critical health situations. Autonomous monitoring can alert doctors and patients themselves of unexpected health conditions. Real-time monitoring, modeling, and predicting health conditions can trigger swift responses by doctors and health officials in case of emergencies. This study will use data science to stimulate discoveries and breakthroughs in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and India, which will then be reproduced in other world areas to create major gains in health for people, communities, and populations.

AB  - An intelligent insole system may monitor the individual's foot pressure and temperature in real-time from the comfort of their home, which can help capture foot problems in their earliest stages. Constant monitoring for foot complications is essential to avoid potentially devastating outcomes from common diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Inspired by those goals, the authors of this work propose a full design for a wearable insole that can detect both plantar pressure and temperature using off-the-shelf sensors. The design provides details of specific temperature and pressure sensors, circuit configuration for characterizing the sensors, and design considerations for creating a small system with suitable electronics. The procedure also details how, using a low-power communication protocol, data about the individuals' foot pressure and temperatures may be sent wirelessly to a centralized device for storage. This research may aid in the creation of an affordable, practical, and portable foot monitoring system for patients. The solution can be used for continuous, at-home monitoring of foot problems through pressure patterns and temperature differences between the two feet. The generated maps can be used for early detection of diabetic foot complication with the help of artificial intelligence.

AB  - Blepharospasm (BL) is characterized by involuntary closures of the eyelids due to spasms of the orbicularis oculi muscle. The gold standard for clinical evaluation of BL involves visual inspection for manual rating scales. This approach is highly subjective and error prone. Unfortunately, there are currently no simple quantitative systems for accurate and objective diagnostics of BL. Here, we introduce a soft, flexible hybrid bioelectronic system that offers highly conformal, gentle lamination on the skin, while enabling wireless, quantitative detection of electrophysiological signals. Computational and experimental studies of soft materials and flexible mechanics provide a set of key fundamental design factors for a low-profile bioelectronic system. The nanomembrane soft electrodes, mounted around the eyes, are capable of accurately measuring clinical symptoms, including the frequency of blinking, the duration of eye closures during spasms, as well as combinations of blinking and spasms. The use of a deep-learning, convolutional neural network, with the bioelectronics offers objective, real-time classification of key pathological features in BL. The wearable bioelectronics outperform the conventional manual clinical rating, as shown by a pilot study with 13 patients. In vivo demonstration of the bioelectronics with these patients indicates the device as an easy-to-use solution for objective quantification of BL.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of preventable strokes. Screening asymptomatic individuals for AF may increase anticoagulant use for stroke prevention.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate 2 home-based AF screening interventions.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter randomized clinical trial recruited individuals from primary care practices aged 75 years or older with hypertension and without known AF. From April 5, 2015, to March 26, 2019, 856 participants were enrolled from 48 practices.
   INTERVENTIONS The control group received standard care (routine clinical follow-up plus a pulse check and heart auscultation at baseline and 6 months). The screening group received a 2-week continuous electrocardiographic (cECG) patch monitor to wear at baseline and at 3 months, in addition to standard care. The screening group also received automated home blood pressure (BP) machines with oscillometric AF screening capability to use twice-daily during the cECG monitoring periods.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES With intention-to-screen analysis, the primary outcomewas AF detected by cECG monitoring or clinically within 6 Mmonths. Secondary outcomes included anticoagulant use, device adherence, and AF detection by BP monitors.
   RESULTS Of the 856 participants, 487 were women (56.9%); mean (SD) age was 80.0 (4.0) years. Median cECG wear time was 27.4 of 28 days (interquartile range [IQR], 18.4-28.0 days). In the primary analysis, AF was detected in 23 of 434 participants (5.3%) in the screening group vs 2 of 422 (0.5%) in the control group (relative risk, 11.2; 95% CI, 2.7-47.1; P =.001; absolute difference, 4.8%; 95% CI, 2.6%-7.0%; P <.001; number needed to screen, 21). Of those with cECG-detected AF, median total time spent in AF was 6.3 hours (IQR, 4.2-14.0 hours; range 1.3 hours-28 days), and median duration of the longest AF episode was 5.7 hours (IQR, 2.9-12.9 hours). Anticoagulation was initiated in 15 of 20 patients (75.0%) with cECG-detected AF. By 6 months, anticoagulant therapy had been prescribed for 18 of 434 participants (4.1%) in the screening group vs 4 of 422 (0.9%) in the control group (relative risk, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.5-12.8; P =.007; absolute difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, 1.1%-5.3%; P =.003). Twice-daily AF screening using the home BP monitor had a sensitivity of 35.0% (95% CI, 15.4%-59.2%), specificity of 81.0% (95% CI, 76.7%-84.8%), positive predictive value of 8.9% (95% CI, 4.9%-15.5%), and negative predictive value of 95.9%(95% CI, 94.5%-97.0%). Adverse skin reactions requiring premature discontinuation of cECG monitoring occurred in 5 of 434 participants (1.2%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, among older community-dwelling individuals with hypertension, AF screening with a wearable cECG monitor was well tolerated, increased AF detection 10-fold, and prompted initiation of anticoagulant therapy in most cases. Compared with continuous ECG, intermittent oscillometric screening with a BP monitor was an inferior strategy for detecting paroxysmal AF. Large trials with hard clinical outcomes are now needed to evaluate the potential benefits and harms of AF screening.

AB  - BackgroundAn incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) refers to remaining sensorimotor function below the injury with the possibility for the patient to regain walking abilities. However, these patients often suffer from diverse gait deficits, which are not objectively assessed in the current clinical routine. Wearable inertial sensors are a promising tool to capture gait patterns objectively and started to gain ground for other neurological disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. In this work, we present a data-driven approach to assess walking for SCI patients based on sensor-derived outcome measures. We aimed to (i) characterize their walking pattern in more depth by identifying groups with similar walking characteristics and (ii) use sensor-derived gait parameters as predictors for future walking capacity.MethodsThe dataset analyzed consisted of 66 SCI patients and 20 healthy controls performing a standardized gait test, namely the 6-min walking test (6MWT), while wearing a sparse sensor setup of one sensor attached to each ankle. A data-driven approach has been followed using statistical methods and machine learning models to identify relevant and non-redundant gait parameters.ResultsClustering resulted in 4 groups of patients that were compared to each other and to the healthy controls. The clusters did differ in terms of their average walking speed but also in terms of more qualitative gait parameters such as variability or parameters indicating compensatory movements. Further, using longitudinal data from a subset of patients that performed the 6MWT several times during their rehabilitation, a prediction model has been trained to estimate whether the patient's walking speed will improve significantly in the future. Including sensor-derived gait parameters as inputs for the prediction model resulted in an accuracy of 80%, which is a considerable improvement of 10% compared to using only the days since injury, the present 6MWT distance, and the days until the next 6MWT as predictors.ConclusionsIn summary, the work presented proves that sensor-derived gait parameters provide additional information on walking characteristics and thus are beneficial to complement clinical walking assessments of SCI patients. This work is a step towards a more deficit-oriented therapy and paves the way for better rehabilitation outcome predictions.

AB  - Hard-to-heal wounds (i.e., severe and/or chronic) are typically associated with particular pathologies or afflictions such as diabetes, immunodeficiencies, compression traumas in bedridden people, skin grafts, or third-degree burns. In this situation, it is critical to constantly monitor the healing stages and the overall wound conditions to allow for better-targeted therapies and faster patient recovery. At the moment, this operation is performed by removing the bandages and visually inspecting the wound, putting the patient at risk of infection and disturbing the healing stages. Recently, new devices have been developed to address these issues by monitoring important biomarkers related to the wound health status, such as pH, moisture, etc. In this contribution, we present a novel textile chemical sensor exploiting an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) configuration based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) for uric acid (UA)-selective monitoring in wound exudate. The combination of special medical-grade textile materials provides a passive sampling system that enables the real-time and non-invasive analysis of wound fluid: UA was detected as a benchmark analyte to monitor the health status of wounds since it represents a relevant biomarker associated with infections or necrotization processes in human tissues. The sensors proved to reliably and reversibly detect UA concentration in synthetic wound exudate in the biologically relevant range of 220-750 mu M, operating in flow conditions for better mimicking the real wound bed. This forerunner device paves the way for smart bandages integrated with real-time monitoring OECT-based sensors for wound-healing evaluation.

AB  - Memory capacity (MC) refers to the limited capacity of working memory and is defined as the number of elements that an individual can remember for a short retention interval. MC is impaired in many human pathologies, such as schizophrenia and ageing. Fronto-striatal dopamine regulates working memory, through its action on dopamine D1- and D2-like receptors. Human and rodent studies have suggested that MC is improved by D2 dopamine receptor agonists. Although D1 receptors have been crucially involved in the maintenance of working memory during delay, their role in regulating the capacity of WM remains poorly explored.
   In this study, we tested the effects of systemic injection of the D1-like and D2-like receptor antagonists, SCH 23390 and Haloperidol respectively, on MC in mice. For this, we used a modified version of the object recognition task, the Different/Identical Objects Task (DOT/IOT), which allows the evaluation of MC in rodents. The results showed a negative interaction between the dose of both drugs and the number of objects that could be remembered. The doses of SCH 23390 and Haloperidol that impaired novel object discrimination in the highest memory load condition were about 4 and 3 time lower, respectively, of those impairing performance in the lowest memory load condition. However, while SCH 23390 specifically impaired memory load capacity, the effects of Haloperidol were associated to impairment in exploratory behaviors. These findings may help to predict the cognitive side effects induced by Haloperidol in healthy subjects.

AB  - In an era of many diseases and increased longevity, more attention has been paid to chronic diseases that require constant health care. Under this circumstance, the development of research and development (R&D) for smart-device-based constant health care has drawn great attention. With the emergence of wearable devices, personal health devices (PHDs), and smartphones, various contents for constant health care have been developed. By using these devices, the users are able to collect personal health records (PHRs) that include data such as activity amount, heart rate, stress, and blood sugar. The range of the collected PHRs can be limited depending on the equipment or the surrounding environment. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to make a comparison with similar users in a cluster. Also, it is necessary to provide a service that can analyze and visually display the collected personal-health information. In this paper, we propose the mining of health-risk factors using the PHR similarity in a hybrid P2P network. This is a method of predicting a user's health status using similarity-based data mining, where the PHRs are employed in a hybrid P2P environment consisting of a peer, a server, and a gateway. In a hybrid P2P environment, a user receives feedback on the result of a structured-data analysis. A peer searches for a different peer and gateway through a server and exchanges information. Depending on the data type, the PHR is divided into medical health examination, self-diagnosis, and personal-health data. The medical health examination contains the personal-health data that are generated regularly by a medical institution. Self-diagnosis represents the data of mental health, pains, and fatigue that can be changed often but cannot be collected by devices. Personal-health data mean the data that can be collected by individuals in everyday life. For the PHR-data analysis, an index is given to each attribute, and preprocessing is performed after a binary-code conversion. To predict a user's health status, the PHR data are clustered on the basis of similarity in a hybrid P2P environment. The similarity between a user's PHR and a PHR that is searched for in the network is measured. After the measurement, an index is given to the PHR that meets the minimum similarity and the PHR is incorporated into a Similarity PHR Group. The Similarity PHR Group flexibly changes depending on a user's PHR status and the statuses of the users who have accessed the hybrid P2P network. A representative value of the Similarity PHR Group is extracted and is then compared with the user's PHR to judge the user's health status. The proposed method is suitable for a smart health service for chronic diseases requiring constant care, elderly health, and aftercare. This is a user-oriented health-care and promotion service wherein a user's health status can be predicted through the mining of the health-risk factors of PHRs.

AB  - Adolescent stress is complex and impairing. Novel measures are needed to understand stress variability within individuals over time from a physiological as well as a subjective perspective. To test the feasibility of combining ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and wearable biosensors to assess adolescent stress, using an idiographic approach with experience sampling methods. A small sample (n = 23) of predominantly African American, economically disadvantaged adolescents were asked to complete EMA surveys four times per day and wear an armband measuring Heart rate (HR) and skin response for a 2-week period. Descriptive analyses examined number of hours of armband wear, percentage of viable data, and percentage of surveys completed by gender and race. Associations between biosensor data and EMA reports within and across individuals were also examined using hierarchical linear regression. EMA survey completion was good (81%) as was adherence to biosensor protocols, although technological difficulties interfered with collection of HR variability for youth with darker skin tones. Youth reported stressful events in 12.79% of EMA surveys, although 43% reported no negative mood experiences. Convergent validity was supported for detecting between-person (EMA) and within-person (EMA and biosensors) variability in stress across time, although associations across youth were highly variable. Results suggest value for biobehavioral methods in understanding day-to-day stress in adolescents but highlight variability in stress experiences as well as technological limitations, especially for youth of colour.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized health care sector drastically since last decade. Recent advances in digital world have helped to achieve prevention and management of chronic diseases by the IoMT technology based devices in medical field. Advanced science, cloud technology, and new generations of smart-phones, plus tablets with integrated apps have helped patients to track their diseases continuously on daily basis. Dentistry has also transformed completely due to establishment of computer-based advanced technologies, new preventive disease measures, and improved diagnostic techniques in last few years. Internet of Dental Things (IoDT) is an innovative approach to achieve prevention and management of dental caries, periodontal diseases, oral cancers, and other dental diseases. IoDT could play vital role in collection and monitoring of patients' data for oral health care; moreover this data could be used in eventual risk assessment and further research. This paper reviews IoMT and its possible application IoDT in dentistry; additionally it also introduces IoDT technology dependent oral heath-care model and architecture applied to dentistry. In addition, it also reviews data collection devices used with reference to IoDT technology. Thus the overview compiles recent studies on arising digital progressions in dentistry and recommends IoDT as the futuristic advent in the advanced clinical dentistry. To conclude, IoDT will influence positively clinical monitoring, and oral-health data collection; furthermore IoDT will also improve overall management of oral diseases.

AB  - Pressure sensors for living organisms can monitor both the movement behavior of the organism and pressure changes of the organ, and they have vast perspectives for the health management information platform and disease diagnostics/treatment through the micropressure changes of organs. Although pressure sensors have been widely integrated with e-skin or other wearable systems for health monitoring, they have not been approved for comprehensive surveillance and monitoring of living organisms due to their unsatisfied sensing performance. To solve the problem, here, we introduce a novel structural design strategy to manufacture reduced graphene oxide-polypyrrole aerogel-based microfibers with a typical coaxial heterogeneous structure, which significantly enhances the sensitivity, resolution, and stability of the derived pressure microsensors. The as-fabricated pressure microsensors exhibit ultrahigh sensitivities of 12.84, 18.27, and 4.46 kPa(-1) in the pressure ranges of 0-20, 20-40, and 40-65 Pa, respectively, high resolution (0.2 Pa), and good stability in 450 cycles. Furthermore, the microsensor is applied to detect the movement behavior and organic micropressure changes for mice and serves as a platform for monitoring micropressure for the integrative diagnosis both n vivo and in vitro of organisms.

AB  - Context: The hybrid assistive limb (HAL) is a wearable robot suit that assists in voluntary control of knee and hip joint motion by detecting bioelectric signals on the surface of the skin with high sensitivity. HAL has been reported to be effective for functional recovery in motor impairments. However, few reports have revealed the utility of HAL for patients who have undergone surgery for thoracic ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (thoracic OPLL). Herein, we present a postoperative thoracic OPLL patient who showed remarkable functional recovery after training with HAL.
   Findings: A 63-year-old woman, who could not walk due to muscle weakness before surgery, underwent posterior decompression and fusion. Paralysis was re-aggravated after the initial postoperative rising. We diagnosed that paralysis was due to residual compression from the anterior lesion and microinstability after posterior fixation, and prescribed bed rest for a further 3 weeks. The incomplete paralysis gradually recovered, and walking training with HAL was started on postoperative day 44 in addition to standard physical therapy. The patient underwent 10 sessions of HAL training until discharge on postoperative day 73. Results of a 10-m walk test were assessed after every session, and the patient's speed and cadence markedly improved. At discharge, the patient could walk with 2 crutches and no assistance. Furthermore, no adverse events associated with HAL training occurred.
   Conclusion: HAL training for postoperative thoracic OPLL patients may enhance improvement in walking ability, even if severe impairment of ambulation and muscle weakness exist preoperatively.

AB  - Terminology is the most basic information that researchers and literature analysis systems need to understand. Mining terms and revealing the semantic relationships between terms can help biomedical researchers find solutions to some major health problems and motivate researchers to explore innovative biomedical research issues. However, how to mine terms from biomedical literature remains a challenge. At present, the research on text segmentation in natural language processing (NLP) technology has not been well applied in the biomedical field. Named entity recognition models usually require a large amount of training corpus, and the types of entities that the model can recognize are limited. Besides, dictionary-based methods mainly use pre-established vocabularies to match the text. However, this method can only match terms in a specific field, and the process of collecting terms is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Many scenarios faced in the field of biomedical research are unsupervised, i.e. unlabelled corpora, and the system may not have much prior knowledge. This paper proposes the TermInformer project, which aims to mine the meaning of terms in an open fashion by calculating terms and find solutions to some of the significant problems in our society. We propose an unsupervised method that can automatically mine terms in the text without relying on external resources. Our method can generally be applied to any document data. Combined with the word vector training algorithm, we can obtain reusable term embeddings, which can be used in any NLP downstream application. This paper compares term embeddings with existing word embeddings. The results show that our method can better reflect the semantic relationship between terms. Finally, we use the proposed method to find potential factors and treatments for lung cancer, breast cancer, and coronavirus.

AB  - ObjectivesDisability in patients with epilepsy (PWEs) is multifactorial: beyond seizure frequency/severity, PWEs are prone to a range of neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and somatic comorbidities that significantly affect quality of life. Here, we explored how variations in seizure severity and the burden of self-reported somatic/neuropsychiatric symptoms correlate with disruptions to 24 h activity patterns (rest-activity rhythms [RARs]), determined through wrist accelerometry/actigraphy.
   MethodsMultiday wrist-actigraphy recordings were obtained from 59 adult patients with focal epilepsy (44% male, ages 18-72), who contemporaneously responded to validated psychometric instruments to measure anxiety, depression, sleepiness, and somatic symptoms. We conducted a similar in silico psychometric-actigraphic correlation in a publicly available data set of 1747 Hispanic subjects (35% male, ages 18-65) from the Study of Latinos (SOL) Sueno Ancillary Study. RARs were analyzed via a sigmoidally-transformed cosine model (quantifying amplitude, steepness, acrophase, and robustness) and nonparametric measures to estimate RAR stability, fragmentation, and sleep.
   ResultsCompared with matched SOL subjects, RARs from PWE subjects featured a significantly lower amplitude, a wider rest phase, and significantly more total daily sleep. Within PWEs, similar RAR distortions were associated with seizure intractability and/or anticonvulsant polytherapy, whereas high anxiety, depression, and somatic symptom scores were associated with lower RAR robustness and acrophase delay. We applied the SOL data set to train logistic regression models to dichotomously classify subjective anxiety, depression, and sleepiness symptoms using demographic and RAR parameters. When tested on PWEs, these models predicted prevalent anxiety and depression symptom burden (accuracy similar to 70%) but failed to predict subjective sleepiness.
   SignificanceTogether these results demonstrate that RAR features may encode prevalent depression and anxiety symptoms in patients with focal epilepsy, potentially offering wearable-derived endpoints to adjunct clinical care and drug/device trials. With larger PWE-specific actigraphic-psychometric data sets, we may identify RAR signatures that may more precisely correlate with varying seizure frequency, the burden of anticonvulsant therapy, and prevalent mood/anxiety symptoms.

AB  - it aimed to establish a maternal and child monitoring system based on medical Internet of Things (IoT) technology and explore the application of gold magnetic nanoparticles (Au-MNPs) in bacterial detection. The effect of active Bifidobacterium tablet (Siliankang) on intestinal flora of pregnant women and reaction to early pregnancy was analyzed. A real-time fetal heart rate monitoring method was established based on median filtering algorithm, and a maternal and infant monitoring system was established by organically combining portable monitoring equipment and hospital monitoring center through the IoT. Fe(3)O(4 & nbsp;)nanoparticles and Au-NPs were prepared by co-precipitation method and Turkevitch-Frens method. Fe3O4-Au-SiO2 NPs was obtained by polymerizing Au-NPs into Fe3O4 nanoparticles and coating the surface with SiO2. The characterization of NPs and its bacterial adsorption efficiency were analyzed, and a capture sensor for the detection of bacterial Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was prepared. A total of 120 patients with pregnancy reaction were selected as the research object, and were divided into the placebo group and the experimental group (compound probiotics supplement group) according to different treatment methods, with 60 patients in each group. The bacterial DNA detection sensor was used to detect the difference of bacterial flora in feces of patients in different groups. The results showed that the particle size of Fe3O4-Au-SiO2 NPs was 15-47 nm, and the adsorption efficiency of Fe3O4- Au-SiO2 NPs to S. aureus, S. epidermidi, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa was higher than 80%. The Fe3O4-Au-SiO2 NPs of the prepared bacterial DNA detection sensor could be hybridized with the target bacterial DNA sequence. the intestinal enterobacteria, enterococci, and Bacteroides of patients in test group were remarkably reduced in contrast to control group, while the Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Fusobacterium flora were greatly increased (P < 0.05). the number of NVP patients in the control group and test group was 19 case (31.7%) and 5 case (8.3%). The probability of early pregnancy reaction was notably reduced (P < 0.05). It showed that the maternal and infant monitoring system based on Internet of things technology had potential application value for maternal and infant health. Tetralogy of viable Bifidobacterium tablets (Siliankang) can reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the intestines of pregnant women, and then reduced the incidence of early pregnancy reactions.

AB  - The comfortable, continuous monitoring of vital parameters is still a challenge. The long-term measurement of respiration and cardiovascular signals is required to diagnose cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Similarly, sleep quality assessment and the recovery period following acute treatments require long-term vital parameter datalogging. To address these requirements, we have developed "VitalCore", a wearable continuous vital parameter monitoring device in the form of a T-shirt targeting the uninterrupted monitoring of respiration, pulse, and actigraphy. VitalCore uses polymer-based stretchable resistive bands as the primary sensor to capture breathing and pulse patterns from chest expansion. The carbon black-impregnated polymer is implemented in a U-shaped configuration and attached to the T-shirt with "interfacing" material along with the accompanying electronics. In this paper, VitalCore is bench tested and compared to gold standard respiration and pulse measurements to verify its functionality and further to assess the quality of data captured during sleep and during light exercise (walking). We show that these polymer-based sensors could identify respiratory peaks with a sensitivity of 99.44%, precision of 96.23%, and false-negative rate of 0.557% during sleep. We also show that this T-shirt configuration allows the wearer to sleep in all sleeping positions with a negligible difference of data quality. The device was also able to capture breathing during gait with 88.9-100% accuracy in respiratory peak detection.

AB  - Abnormal migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are the pathological basis of hyperplasia during vein graft disease. It remains unknown if circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in vein graft disease. In the present study, a rat vein graft model was constructed by the "cuff" technique, and whole transcriptome deep sequencing was applied to identify differential circRNAs in the grafted vein compared to the control. We identified a novel circRNA, named circTET3, whose structure was verified by Sanger sequencing and RNase R digestion. CircTET3 was increased in the grafted vein and stably located in the cytoplasm as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Knockdown of circTET3 suppressed VSMC migration by acting as an endogenous miR-351-5p sponge detected by RNA pull-down and dual-luciferase reporter assays. PTPN1 was the targeted gene due to the competitive binding of circTET3 to miR-351-5p. This regulatory pathway may serve as a potential therapeutic avenue against intimal hyperplasia in vein graft disease.

AB  - Conducting polymers tethered with molecular recognition elements are good candidates for biosensing applications such as detecting a target molecule with selectivity. We develop a new monomer, namely, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene bearing a pyridylboronic acid moiety (EDOT-PyBA), for label-free detection of sialic acid as a cancer biomarker. PyBA, which is known to show specific binding to sialic acid in acid conditions is used as a synthetic ligand instead of lectins. PyBA confirms the enhanced binding affinity for sialic acid at pH 5.0-6.0 compared with traditional phenylboronic acid. Poly(EDOT-PyBA) is electrodeposited on a planar glassy carbon electrode and the obtained film is successfully characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, water contact angle measurements, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The specific interaction of PyBA with sialic acid at the solution/electrode interface is detected by differential pulse voltammetry in a dynamic range 0.1-3.0 mM with a detection limit of 0.1 mM for a detection time of 3 min. The sensitivity covers the total level of free sialic acid in human serum and the assay time is the shorter than that of other methods. The poly(EDOT-PyBA) electrode successfully detects spiked sialic acid in human serum samples. Owing to its processability, mass productivity, and robustness, polythiophene conjugated with "boronolectin" is a candidate material for developing point-of-care and wearable biosensors.

AB  - Glucose monitoring sensors with high softness and flexibility are critical for the developments of wearable and implantable healthcare devices that enable diagnosis, prognosis, and management of diabetes. The design and implementation of such sensors have been extensively exploited by electrochemical strategies, which, however, suffer from poor reusability and complex modification procedures, and necessitate frequent calibration or sensor replacement due to enzymatic reaction instability. Here, a soft and plasmonic hydrogel optical sensor is created for quantitative and continuous glucose monitoring under physiological conditions. The optical sensor consists of a flexible optical fiber made from composites of gold nanoparticles and glucose-responsive hydrogels. The reversible binding of glucose to the nanocomposite optical fiber results in dynamic volume expansion of the hydrogel matrix, which modulates the localized surface plasmon resonance effect, enabling glucose to be quantified from the light transmission. To achieve robust readout, a dual-wavelength differential approach is employed to endow the sensor with self calibration capability. We show that the sensor is reversible and reusable for detecting physiological glucose levels with high linearity and negligible hysteresis. The soft and flexible glucose sensor holds great promises of serving as a minimally-invasive probe for point-of-care glucose monitoring in clinics.

AB  - A brain needle biopsy procedure is performed for suspected brain lesions in order to sample tissue that is subsequently analysed using standard histopathology techniques. A common complication resulting from this procedure is brain hemorrhaging from blood vessels clipped off during tissue extraction. Interstitial optical tomography (iOT) has recently been introduced by our group as a mean to assess the presence of blood vessels in the vicinity of the needle. The clinical need to improve safety requires the detection of blood vessels within 2 mm from the outer surface of the needle, since this distance is representative of the volume of tissue that is aspirated durirng tissue extraction. Here, a sensitivity analysis is presented to establish the intrinsic detection limits of iOT based on simulations and experiments using brain tissue phantoms. It is demonstrated that absorbers can be detected with diameters >300 mu m located up to >2 mm from the biopsy needle core for bulk optical properties consistent with brain tissue.

AB  - Wearable activity monitors, together with smartphone-based health and fitness applications (apps), are becoming more accessible and their widespread use provides an additional opportunity for the recording of cardiovascular metrics in patients with cardiovascular disease. The use of selected metrics by cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programmes allows the facilitation of individualized and tailored positive lifestyle changes to patients and places the patient at the centre of their recovery programme. To investigate the role of such devices on outcomes with patients on a CR programme, a cohort/case-control study was conducted. Patients post-myocardial infarction who were treated with either percutaneous coronary intervention or surgical coronary revascularisation at a single centre were invited to use a physical activity monitor linked to a customized app at their initial assessment for the rehabilitation programme. Those who accepted were allocated to the treatment group. The control group was selected from a larger pool of 400 historical and concurrent patients. Propensity matching was used to associate each case with their closest control. The changes in self-reported physical activity were similar for both groups at the end of the CR programme (EOP). The digitally monitored group tended to achieve greater METS (metabolic equivalent of task - a measure of exercise intensity) at 12 weeks (P < 0.059); however, no difference was observed in the overall change in METS at EOP (P < 0.333). Although no difference was noted in diastolic blood pressure, a statistically significant drop in the systolic blood pressure in the digitally monitored group (P < 0.004) was detected. In this study, the innovative combination of technology and face-to-face CR showed promising results and assisted the individualization of delivered content. This intervention could easily be replicated and expanded. Challenges are the recruitment of the elderly population, those who may be less engaged with or have less access to technology, and the underrepresentation of women in the study sample.

AB  - The extraction of tissue samples during brain needle biopsy can cause life-threatening hemorrhage because of significant blood vessel injury during the procedure. Vessel rupture can have significant consequences for patient health, ranging from transient neurological deficits to death. Here, we present a sub-diffuse optical tomography technique that can be integrated into neurosurgical workflow to detect the presence of blood vessels. A proof-of-concept study performed on a realistic brain tissue phantom is presented and demonstrates that interstitial optical tomography (iOT) can detect several 1 mm diameter high-contrast absorbing objects located <2 mm from the needle.

TI  - Bayesian structural time series for biomedical sensor data: A flexible modeling framework for evaluating interventions
T2  - PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The development of mobile-health technology has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine. Biomedical sensors (e.g. wearables) can assist with determining treatment plans for individuals, provide quantitative information to healthcare providers, and give objective measurements of health, leading to the goal of precise phenotypic correlates for genotypes. Even though treatments and interventions are becoming more specific and datasets more abundant, measuring the causal impact of health interventions requires careful considerations of complex covariate structures, as well as knowledge of the temporal and spatial properties of the data. Thus, interpreting biomedical sensor data needs to make use of specialized statistical models. Here, we show how the Bayesian structural time series framework, widely used in economics, can be applied to these data. This framework corrects for covariates to provide accurate assessments of the significance of interventions. Furthermore, it allows for a time-dependent confidence interval of impact, which is useful for considering individualized assessments of intervention efficacy. We provide a customized biomedical adaptor tool, MhealthCI, around a specific implementation of the Bayesian structural time series framework that uniformly processes, prepares, and registers diverse biomedical data. We apply the software implementation of MhealthCI to a structured set of examples in biomedicine to showcase the ability of the framework to evaluate interventions with varying levels of data richness and covariate complexity and also compare the performance to other models. Specifically, we show how the framework is able to evaluate an exercise intervention's effect on stabilizing blood glucose in a diabetes dataset. We also provide a future-anticipating illustration from a behavioral dataset showcasing how the framework integrates complex spatial covariates. Overall, we show the robustness of the Bayesian structural time series framework when applied to biomedical sensor data, highlighting its increasing value for current and future datasets.
   Author summary In this paper, we propose and describe a robust and flexible modelling framework called MhealthCI based on the Bayesian structural time series, for which we have found to excel at analyzing diverse biosensor data. While Bayesian modelling is often employed in various fields such as finance, marketing, and weather forecasting, it is rarely used in biomedicine, specifically for biosensor and wearable data relating to human health and behavior. We use and apply this framework with the goal of interpreting and quantifying the causal impact of an intervention, a widespread goal of biomedicine. We describe the diversity of data types to which it could apply, provide intuition to its mechanics, collect relevant data in various fields, provide a wrapper tool around well-known R packages that prepares and registers diverse biosensor data to be analyzed, and finally apply the method to showcase its strength in quantifying the impact of interventions.

AB  - We introduce a skin-friendly electronic system that enables human-computer interaction (HCI) for swallowing training in dysphagia rehabilitation. For an ergonomic HCI, we utilize a soft, highly compliant ("skin-like") electrode, which addresses critical issues of an existing rigid and planar electrode combined with a problematic conductive electrolyte and adhesive pad. The skin-like electrode offers a highly conformal, user-comfortable interaction with the skin for long-term wearable, high-fidelity recording of swallowing electromyograms on the chin. Mechanics modeling and experimental quantification captures the ultra-elastic mechanical characteristics of an open mesh microstructured sensor, conjugated with an elastomeric membrane. Systematic in vivo studies investigate the functionality of the soft electronics for HCI-enabled swallowing training, which includes the application of a biofeedback system to detect swallowing behavior. The collection of results demonstrates clinical feasibility of the ergonomic electronics in HCI-driven rehabilitation for patients with swallowing disorders.

AB  - Recent progress in Internet of Things (IoT) platforms has allowed us to collect large amounts of sensing data. However, there are significant challenges in converting this large-scale sensing data into decisions for real-world applications. Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes. Our results indicate that our activity predictor performs better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple approach for predicting activities from sensor data.

AB  - The use of digital technologies in medicine is developing largely in parallel with the IT industry. Today, every cardiologist in Germany uses IT systems to make appointments, store patient data and write doctor's letters. So why is it necessary to introduce a dedicated eCardiology program within the German Society of Cardiology (DGK)? So far, digitalization has failed in many respects to fulfill its promise of making the daily lives of physicians and patients easier. Clinical EDP solutions derive mainly from accounting systems and lead only to a limited extent to an improvement in patient care. Negative effects on burnout rates and job satisfaction of medical staff could even be observed. Additionally, since May 2018 the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation with its principles of purpose limitation and data minimization has made the storage and use of medical data more difficult. This also has fundamental implications for developments in artificial intelligence (AI), which are based on the availability and quality of big data (= large, complex data sets) and could permanently change the healthcare system. The technology-driven progress of medicine does not end at the doorstep of a hospital but causes a significant cultural change in our society. The use of so-called wearables, search engines on the Internet and social media is increasingly enabling e-patients to make their own diagnoses and independent decisions regarding their health. As a result, physicians often see well-informed, but also misinformed patients who have been advised on health-related data by their own smart devices. The DGK recognizes the enormous challenges and potential of digital medicine to improve the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases. As part of the eCardiology program, the Society has established five committees to promote and communicate important aspects of digital health: transsectoral collaboration, mobile health, precision digital health, society and policy, and education and media. We report here on the elements of each committee and its working groups.

AB  - Background Regular physical activity (PA), healthy habits, and an appropriate diet are recommended guidelines to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle can help to avoid chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. A monitoring and automatic personalized lifestyle recommendation system (i.e., automatic electronic coach or eCoach) with considering clinical and ethical guidelines, individual health status, condition, and preferences may successfully help participants to follow recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As a prerequisite for the prototype design of such a helpful eCoach system, it is essential to involve the end-users and subject-matter experts throughout the iterative design process. Methods We used an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to understend context of use and to collect qualitative data to develop a roadmap for self-management with eCoaching. We involved researchers, non-technical and technical, health professionals, subject-matter experts, and potential end-users in design process. We designed and developed the eCoach prototype in two stages, adopting different phases of the iterative design process. In design workshop 1, we focused on identifying end-users, understanding the user's context, specifying user requirements, designing and developing an initial low-fidelity eCoach prototype. In design workshop 2, we focused on maturing the low-fidelity solution design and development for the visualization of continuous and discrete data, artificial intelligence (AI)-based interval forecasting, personalized recommendations, and activity goals. Results The iterative design process helped to develop a working prototype of eCoach system that meets end-user's requirements and expectations towards an effective recommendation visualization, considering diversity in culture, quality of life, and human values. The design provides an early version of the solution, consisting of wearable technology, a mobile app following the "Google Material Design" guidelines, and web content for self-monitoring, goal setting, and lifestyle recommendations in an engaging manner between the eCoach app and end-users. Conclusions The adopted iterative design process brings in a design focus on the user and their needs at each phase. Throughout the design process, users have been involved at the heart of the design to create a working research prototype to improve the fit between technology, end-user, and researchers. Furthermore, we performed a technological readiness study of ProHealth eCoach against standard levels set by European Union (EU).

AB  - Soft multimodal sensors in practical applications for health monitoring and human-machine interfaces require them to show sufficiently high sensitivity over wide sensing rages, rapid response and excellent durability, and waterproof property. Herein, we demonstrate a dual-mode sensor based on a porous graphene foam composite to achieve the aforementioned challenging yet attractive performance parameters for strain and temperature sensing. The resulting dual-mode sensor exhibits a strain sensitivity of 2212.5 in the wide piecewise linear range of 0-65%, a rapid response of 0.11 s, an ultralow detection limit of 0.0167%, and outstanding stability over 15,000 cycles. The sensor can also detect temperature with a high sensitivity of 0.97 x 10-2 degrees C -1 over a wide linear range of 10-185 degrees C and a small detection limit for sensing both low- and high-temperature environments. Taken together with the waterproof property, the dual-mode sensor can accurately monitor the large, small, and even subtle motions and temperature variations in both dry and underwater conditions. The capability to detect the subtle yet rapidly changing motions from distal arteries and skeletal muscles paves the way for the development of future soft multimodal, waterproof electronic sensing devices toward human-computer interaction, health monitoring and early disease prevention, and personalized medicine.

AB  - Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac dysrhythmia with high morbidity and mortality rate. Evidence shows that in every three patients with AF, one is asymptomatic. The asymptomatic and paroxysmal nature of AF is the reason for unsatisfactory and delayed detection using traditional instruments. Research indicates that wearing a dynamic electrocardiogram (ECG) recorder can guide accurate and safe analysis, interpretation, and distinction of AF from normal sinus rhythm. This is also achievable in an upright position and after exercises, assisted by an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm. Methods This study enrolled 114 participants from the outpatient registry of our institution from June 24, 2020 to July 24, 2020. Participants were tested with a wearable dynamic ECG recorder and 12-lead ECG in a supine, an upright position and after exercises for 60 s. Results Of the 114 subjects enrolled in the study, 61 had normal sinus rhythm and 53 had AF. The number of cases that could not be determined by the wristband of dynamic ECG recorder was two, one and one respectively. Case results that were not clinically objective were defined as false-negative or false-positive. Results for diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity tested by wearable dynamic ECG recorders in a supine position were 94.74% (95% CI% 88.76-97.80%), 88.68% (95% CI 77.06-95.07%), and 100% (95% CI 92.91-100%), respectively. Meanwhile, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in an upright position were 97.37% (95% CI 92.21-99.44%), 94.34% (95% CI 84.03-98.65%), and 100% (95% CI 92.91-100%), respectively. Similar results as those of the upright position were obtained after exercise. Conclusion The widely accessible wearable dynamic ECG recorder integrated with an AI algorithm can efficiently detect AF in different postures and after exercises. As such, this tool holds great promise as a useful and user-friendly screening method for timely AF diagnosis in at-risk individuals.

AB  - Psoriasis increases the risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) and thromboembolic events (TE). There is limited information on the effect of psoriasis severity on AF and TE. In this study, psoriasis patients were enrolled from the Korean National Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (2004-2008). Diagnosis and disease severity were determined from claims data. Newly diagnosed non-valvular AF and TE were identified during a 9.6-year follow-up. The effect of psoriasis severity on AF and TE was evaluated. We identified 13,385 psoriasis patients (1,947 with severe psoriasis). Severe psoriasis significantly increased the risk of AF (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadjust] 1.44 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.82], p = 0.002) and TE (HRadjust 1.26 [95% CI 1.07-1.47], p = 0.005); mild psoriasis did not show any significant effects. Results were similar after propensity-score matching. Risk increments of AF and TE were prominent in patients with greater cardiovascular risk. A possible limitation of our study is that it has a retrospective design, and the effect of unmeasured confounders and risk of misclassification could bias the results. To conclude, our results showed that severe, but not mild, psoriasis significantly increased AF and TE risk. AF surveillance and active stroke prevention would be beneficial in such cases.

AB  - Substantial device mass and control complexity can hinder the impact of wearable robotic technologies, such as exoskeletons. Thus, despite promising previous research, the development of a simple, lightweight actuator for these systems has not yet been fully realized. The purpose of this study was to derive and demonstrate a proof-of-concept for a pneumatic interference actuator (PIA)a lightweight, soft actuator able to produce torque by the self-intersection of a fabric balloon that arises from changes in physical geometry. General closed-form equations are derived to express the expected actuator torque and mechanical work as functions of the balloon geometry, pressure, and deflection angle. Hard and soft cylindrical physical prototypes were constructed to assess the accuracy of the mathematical models. The proposed mathematical model was found to agree with the pressure-volume relationship and successfully predict the maximum torque as a function of geometry, pressure, and deflection at nonzero deflection angles. Peak powers up to 122.1 +/- 10.0 W (mean +/- standard deviation), with a resting internal pressure of 158.0 +/- 0.2kPa, were observed from the hard actuator prototype. For the soft actuator prototype, peak powers of 97.9 +/- 21.1 W were observed at a resting pressure of 166.8kPa. The work performed was within 3.2%+/- 3.4% and 14.4%+/- 8.2% of theoretical values across all trials, and within 19.1%+/- 4.4% of theoretical values when compared to the torque-angle relationship. This study highlights the promise of utilizing the self-intersection of a PIA to perform human-scale mechanical work, and future research will focus on implementations for wearable robotic systems.

AB  - In the kinematic design of wearable exoskeletons, the issue of axis misalignments between the human and the exoskeleton joints should be well dealt with. Otherwise, large physical human-robot interaction (p-HRI) forces may occur at the human-robot interfaces, which makes the p-HRI uncomfortable or even unsafe. To cope with this issue, a kinematically compatible design approach of wearable exoskeletons has been investigated by researchers, and great development has been made in recent years. Moreover, the influence of such a design on the exoskeleton's p-HRI performance should be evaluated to determine if the design is feasible. In this paper, a self-adapting lower-limb exoskeleton mechanism for three degrees of freedom gait training is proposed, and the mechanical structure of the exoskeleton mechanism is designed in detail. Then, based on the presented exoskeleton mechanism and the use of suitable force/torque sensors, a p-HRI force measurement system is developed. Subsequently, the p-HRI forces of the human-robot closed chain under the static and motion modes are detected, and the influence of the self-adapting design on the lower-limb exoskeleton mechanism's p-HRI force feature is evaluated. The results indicate that additional human-robot connective joints could reduce the p-HRI force significantly, the compatible design of the exoskeleton mechanism is effective, and is thus applied to human lower-limb gait training.

AB  - Background Currently, we lack objective measures to quantify outcomes in carpal tunnel syndrome. Instead, surgeons rely on patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) to assess the effect of carpal tunnel release (CTR). We assessed the validity and reliability of wearable activity monitors to objectively characterize the functional and sleep impact of CTR. We hypothesized that actigraphy could detect changes in sleep and activity and would demonstrate short-term impairment due the operative procedure. Methods This pilot, prospective, cohort study compared validated PROMS with actigraphy data obtained via wearable activity monitors (ActiGraph Link; ActiGraph Corp, Pensacola, Fla). Subjects completed baseline questionnaires and wore their device for 1 week preoperatively as a baseline. Subjects then underwent open CTR, wearing actigraphy devices for 4 weeks and completing questionnaires at 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively. Preintervention and postintervention data were compared using paired-samplettest. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) questionnaire data were analyzed in accordance with published PROMIS scoring manuals and raw scores were converted to standardizedTscores. Results Twenty subjects (5 males, 15 females) with moderate or severe carpal tunnel syndrome were enrolled. The mean age was 57.7 years. The PROMIS 29 average cumulativeTscore was 42.9 with average change of -0.072 preoperatively versus postoperatively. Average sleep disturbanceTscore was 38.9 preoperatively and 41.4 postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference inTscore in any domain. The mean actigraphy activity data demonstrated near immediate return to baseline activity. Actigraphy sleep data demonstrate improvement in sleep fragmentation and decreased duration of awakenings. Conclusions Overall, patient-generated data detected differences in sleep and activity preoperatively versus postoperatively and demonstrated only a short period of activity disruption after CTR, which may be used when counseling patients. These data support actigraphy as a viable adjunct to traditional PROMS to evaluate the impact of surgical intervention and therefore may be useful in the study of other diseases affecting the upper extremity.

AB  - Camera-based passive dietary intake monitoring is able to continuously capture the eating episodes of a subject, recording rich visual information, such as the type and volume of food being consumed, as well as the eating behaviours of the subject. However, there currently is no method that is able to incorporate these visual clues and provide a comprehensive context of dietary intake from passive recording (e.g., is the subject sharing food with others, what food the subject is eating, and how much food is left in the bowl). On the other hand, privacy is a major concern while egocentric wearable cameras are used for capturing. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserved secure solution (i.e., egocentric image captioning) for dietary assessment with passive monitoring, which unifies food recognition, volume estimation, and scene understanding. By converting images into rich text descriptions, nutritionists can assess individual dietary intake based on the captions instead of the original images, reducing the risk of privacy leakage from images. To this end, an egocentric dietary image captioning dataset has been built, which consists of in-the-wild images captured by head-worn and chest-worn cameras in field studies in Ghana. A novel transformer-based architecture is designed to caption egocentric dietary images. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and to justify the design of the proposed architecture for egocentric dietary image captioning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies image captioning for dietary intake assessment in real life settings.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis is of pivotal importance for patients with cardiac arrhythmias and ischemia to minimize the consequences like strokes and myocardial infarctions. The chance of capturing signals of arrhythmias or ischemia is substantially high when a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can be recorded at the moment when a patient experiences the symptoms. However, until now, available diagnostic systems (Holter monitors and other wearable ECG sensors) have not enabled patients to record a reliable 12-lead ECG at home.
   Objective: The objective of this project was to develop a user-friendly system that enables persons with cardiac complaints to record a reliable 12-lead ECG at home to improve the diagnostic process and, consequently, reduce the time between the onset of symptoms and adequate treatment.
   Methods: Using an iterative design approach, ECGraph was developed. The system consists of an ECG measurement system and a mobile app, which were developed with the help of several concept tests. To evaluate the design, a prototype of the final design was built and a final technical performance test and usability test were executed.
   Results: The ECG measurement system consists of a belt and 4 limb straps. Ten wet Ag/AgCl electrodes are placed in the belt to optimize skin-electrode contact. The product is controlled via an app on the mobile phone of the user. Once a person experiences symptoms, he or she can put on the belt and record ECGs within a few minutes. Short instructions, supported by visualizations, offer guidance during use. ECGs are sent wirelessly to the caregiver, and the designated expert can quickly interpret the results. Usability tests with the final prototype (n=6) showed that the participants were able to put on the product within 8 minutes during first-time use. However, we expect that the placement of the product can be executed faster when the user becomes more familiar with the product. Areas of improvement focus mainly on confidence during product use. In the technical performance test, a 12-lead ECG was made and reproduced 6 times.
   Conclusions: We developed a new 12-lead ECG system for home use. The product is expected to be more user-friendly than current hospital ECG systems and is designed to record more reliable data than current ECG systems for home use, which makes it suitable for expert interpretation. The system has great potential to be incorporated into an outpatient practice, so that arrhythmias and ischemia can be diagnosed and treated as early as possible.

TI  - Successes and challenges of implementing teleprehabilitation for onco-surgical candidates and patients' experience: a retrospective pilot-cohort study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - This study documents the implementation of a multimodal teleprehabilitation program (e.g., completion rate, exercise metrics, and program successes and challenges) for cancer patients undergoing surgery. It also documents the patients' experience of the program. This pilot-cohort study included adults scheduled for elective thoracic and abdominal cancer resection surgery, referred to the prehabilitation clinic to engage in physical activity, and received a teleprehabilitation program between August 1st, 2020, and February 28th, 2021. The technology platform provided to the patients included a tablet and a wearable device to facilitate communication and data collection. Data collected for this article were acquired through virtual physical activity monitoring in addition to patient charts. Qualitative data collected comprised of successes and challenges of implanting a teleprehabilitation program, in addition to patients' perspectives of the program. Quantitative data collected comprised of the exercise metrics, perioperative functional outcomes, in addition to the surgical and postoperative outcomes. Ten patients (8 males and 2 females; mean age: 68.3 years, SD 11.96) diagnosed with various thoracoabdominal malignancies were included in the current descriptive study. The successes identified were related to recruitment and assessment, improvement in functional capacity, clinic scheduling and interventions, and optimal medical follow-up. The challenges identified were related to the adoption of the technologies by patients and the multidisciplinary team, the accurate acquisition of patient physical activity data, and the initial costs to acquire the new technologies. Patients were satisfied with the teleprehabilitation program (i.e., services delivered; average appreciation: 96%), and they perceived the technologies provided to be 90% user-friendly. The findings of the current study highlight important concepts in view of the current international health paradigm changes prioritizing remote interventions facilitated through digital communication technologies. It provides important insight into the clinical application of telehealth in elderly populations, notably in the context of acute preoperative cancer care. This article may provide guidance for other cancer care facilities aiming to implement teleprehabilitation programs.

AB  - Intermuscular coherence allows the investigation of common input to muscle groups. Although beta-band (15-30 Hz) intermuscular coherence is well understood as originating from the cortex, the source of intermuscular coherence at lower frequencies is still unclear. We used a wearable device that recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals during a 24-h period in four lower limb muscles of seven spinal cord injury patients (American Spinal Cord Injury Association impairment scale: A. 6 subjects; B. 1 subject) while they went about their normal daily life activities. We detected natural spasms occurring during these long-lasting recordings and calculated intermuscular coherence between all six possible combinations of muscle pairs. There was significant intermuscular coherence at low frequencies, between 2 and 13 Hz. The most likely source for this was the spinal cord and its peripheral feedback loops, because the spinal lesions in these patients had interrupted connections to supraspinal structures. This is the first report to demonstrate that the spinal cord is capable of producing low-frequency intermuscular coherence with severely reduced or abolished descending drive.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first report to demonstrate that intermuscular coherence between lower limb muscles at low frequencies can be produced by the spinal cord with severely reduced or abolished descending drive.

AB  - Indoor air pollution (IAP) has become a serious concern for developing countries around the world. As human beings spend most of their time indoors, pollution exposure causes a significant impact on their health and well-being. Long term exposure to particulate matter (PM) leads to the risk of chronic health issues such as respiratory disease, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease. In India, around 200 million people use fuel for cooking and heating needs; out of which 0.4% use biogas; 0.1% electricity; 1.5% lignite, coal or charcoal; 2.9% kerosene; 8.9% cow dung cake; 28.6% liquified petroleum gas and 49% use firewood. Almost 70% of the Indian population lives in rural areas, and 80% of those households rely on biomass fuels for routine needs. With 1.3 million deaths per year, poor air quality is the second largest killer in India. Forecasting of indoor air quality (IAQ) can guide building occupants to take prompt actions for ventilation and management on useful time. This paper proposes prediction of IAQ using Keras optimizers and compares their prediction performance. The model is trained using real-time data collected from a cafeteria in the Chandigarh city using IoT sensor network. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a comparative study on the implementation of seven Keras Optimizers for IAQ prediction. The results show that SGD optimizer outperforms other optimizers to ensure adequate and reliable predictions with mean square error = 0.19, mean absolute error = 0.34, root mean square error = 0.43, R-2 score = 0.999555, mean absolute percentage error = 1.21665%, and accuracy = 98.87%.

AB  - Ultraviolet rays can cause serious damage to the skin and eyes, and in severe cases, it may lead to skin cancer. Therefore, the prediction, real-time monitoring, and protection of ultraviolet rays is an important aspect of scientific research. Herein, a novel photochromic hydrogel is developed by using acrylic acid (AA) and 2-(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) as the cross-linking agent for hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) with the addition of microcrystalline 2,2-diphenyl-2H-naphtho[1,2-b] pyran-6-carbaldehyde (NP) for the real-time monitoring and protection against ultraviolet rays. The binding mechanism of AA and DMAEMA is predicted using density functional theory (DFT). Also, the designed photochromic hydrogels exhibit excellent properties of pH and temperature sensitivity, rapid responsiveness, self-healing, pressure resistance, high transparency, and electrical conductivity. The optical performance indicate that the photochromic hydrogel has a fast response to ultraviolet rays with color change occurring in 0.5 s and maximum color development in 5 s. In addition, the hydrogels show excellent compression resistance, and their residual stress decrease by only 0.85% after five cycles of compression. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the multi-induction of these soft photochromic hydrogels could be applied in wearable devices, information storage equipment, display devices, and light printing.

AB  - Background Prior to the final deeming rule, federal law in the USA prohibited electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) from being marketed as smoking cessation products; for other therapeutic purposes and in ways that conveyed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval/endorsement. After August 2016, additional federal prohibitions were added including false/misleading and unauthorised modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) claims. No systematic investigation of e-cigarette health claims has been conducted in the retail environment. We sought to document and characterise claims made in vape shops. Methods Between November 2015 and February 2016, before final deeming rule implementation, two trained data collectors conducted unannounced observational assessments of 46 vape shops in North Carolina. Data collectors used wearable imaging technology to document health claims about e-cigarettes. Photos were coded for five claim types: (1) cessation device; (2) drug effect/device; (3) FDA-approved/endorsed; (4) false/misleading and (5) MRTP. Photos were double coded; differences between coders were adjudicated and reviewed by an expert panel. Results At least one health claim was displayed in 41.3% (n=19) of retailers, ranging from 0 to 27 claims per retailer. All claim types were found. Cessation device claims were the most prevalent (62.2%, n=84), followed by MRTP (27.4%, n=37), drug effect/device (8.1%, n=11), false/misleading (1.5%, n=2), and FDA approved/endorsed (0.7%, n=1). Retail chains made the majority of claims compared with independent shops (88.9% vs 11.1%). Conclusions Many vape shops displayed e-cigarette health claims, which are all now FDA prohibited. These claims could mislead consumers and influence behaviour. Findings highlight the need for retailer education, continued surveillance, enforcement specific to advertising and research on consumer perceptions of claims.

AB  - The presence of missing values in a time-series dataset is a very common and well-known problem. Various statistical and machine learning methods have been developed to overcome this problem, with the aim of filling in the missing values in the data. However, the performances of these methods vary widely, showing a high dependence on the type of data and correlations within the data. In our study, we performed some of the well-known imputation methods, such as expectation maximization, k-nearest neighbor, iterative imputer, random forest, and simple imputer, to impute missing data obtained from smart, wearable health trackers. In this manuscript, we proposed the use of data binning for imputation. We showed that the use of data binned around the missing time interval provides a better imputation than the use of a whole dataset. Imputation was performed for 15 min and 1 h of continuous missing data. We used a dataset with different bin sizes, such as 15 min, 30 min, 45 min, and 1 h, and we carried out evaluations using root mean square error (RMSE) values. We observed that the expectation maximization algorithm worked best for the use of binned data. This was followed by the simple imputer, iterative imputer, and k-nearest neighbor, whereas the random forest method had no effect on data binning during imputation. Moreover, the smallest bin sizes of 15 min and 1 h were observed to provide the lowest RMSE values for the majority of the time frames during the imputation of 15 min and 1 h of missing data, respectively. Although applicable to digital health data, we think that this method will also find applicability in other domains.

AB  - Hydrogels containing colorimetric nanoparticles have been used for ion sensing, glucose detection, and microbial metabolite analyses. In particular, the rapid chemical reaction owing to both the hydrogel form of water retention and the sensitive color change of nanoparticles enables the rapid detection of target substances. Despite this advantage, the poor dispersibility of nanoparticles and the mechanical strength of nanoparticle-hydrogel complexes have limited their application. In this study, we demonstrate a milliliter agarose gel containing homogeneously synthesized polyaniline nanoparticles (PAni-NPs), referred to as PAni-NP-hydrogel complexes (PNHCs). To fabricate the optimal PNHC, we tested various pH solvents based on distilled water and phosphate-buffered saline and studied the colorimetric response of the PNHC with thickness. The colorimetric response of the prepared PNHC to the changes in the pH of the solution demonstrated excellent linearity, suggesting the possibility of using PNHC as a pH sensor. In addition, it was verified that the PNHC could detect minute pH changes caused by the cancer cell metabolites without cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the PNHC can be stably maintained outside water for approximately 12 h without deformation, indicating that it can be used as a disposable patch-type wearable biosensing platform.

AB  - Practical applications of next-generation stretchable electronics hinge on the development of sustained power supplies to drive highly sensitive on-skin sensors and wireless transmission modules. Although the manufacture of stretchable self-charging power units has been demonstrated by integrating stretchable energy harvesters and power management circuits with energy storage units, they often suffer from low and unstable output power especially under mechanical deformation and human movements, as well as complex and expensive fabrication processes. This work presents a low-cost, scalable, and facile manufacturing approach based on laser-induced graphene foams to yield a self-powered wireless sensing platform. 3D porous foams with high specific surface area and excellent charge transport provide an efficient flow of triboelectric electrons in triboelectric nanogenerators. The surface coating or doping with second laser irradiation on these foams can also form a 3D composite to provide high energy density in micro-supercapacitor arrays. The integration of a triboelectric nanogenerator and power management circuits with micro-supercapacitor arrays can efficiently harvest intermittent mechanical energy from body movements into stable power output. 3D foams and their composites patterned into various geometries conveniently create various deformable sensors on large scale at low cost. The generated stable, yet high, power with adjustable voltage and current outputs drives various stretchable sensors and wireless transmission modules to wirelessly measure pulse, strain, temperature, electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and blood oxygen. The self-powered, wireless, wearable sensing platform paves the way to wirelessly detect clinically relevant biophysical and biochemical signals for early disease diagnostics and healthy aging.

AB  - Background
   Currently, it is not feasible to obtain laboratory-based measures of joint motion in large numbers of older adults. We assessed the utility of a portable depth-sensing camera for quantifying hip and knee joint motion of older adults during mobility testing in the community.
   Methods
   Participants were 52 older adults enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study of aging. In a subset, we compared dynamic hip and knee flexion/extension obtained via the depth-sensing camera with that obtained concurrently using a laboratory-based optoelectronic motion capture system. Then we recorded participants' annual instrumented gait assessment in the community setting with the depth-sensing camera and examined the inter-relationships of hip and knee range of motion (ROM) with mobility metrics derived from a wearable sensor and other mobility-related health measures.
   Results
   In the community, we successfully acquired joint motion from 49/52 participants using the depth-sensing camera. Hip and knee ROMs were related to diverse sensor-derived metrics of mobility performance (hip: Pearson's r = 0.31 to 0.58; knee: Pearson's r = 0.29 to 0.51), as well as daily physical activity, conventional motor measures, self-report hip and knee pain and dysfunction, mobility disability, and falls.
   Conclusions
   The depth-sensing camera's high rate of successful data acquisition and correlations of its hip and knee ROMs with other mobility measures suggest that this device can provide a cost-efficient means of quantifying joint motion in large numbers of community-dwelling older adults who span the health spectrum.

AB  - Wearable radiation sensors for workers of radiation-intensive industries provide a measure of radiation exposure but not of its effects on biological tissue. A biohybrid radiation sensing platform based on a new transduction mechanism for detecting biological radiation damage using the metabolic activity of a microorganism population is presented here. The sensor is a wearable, disposable, film-type device fabricated on a paper substrate with yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells patterned between two electrodes and used as a smart material. The device is sensitive to radiation when dry and is read by activating it with water. Yeast (S. cerevisiae) cells, that are exposed to ionizing radiation and subsequently allowed to ferment a glucose solution, exhibit an electrical conductivity that is lower than that of nonexposed yeast. The radiation damage to this microorganism is directly proportional to the measured impedance of the fermenting medium. An 18 x 18 mm(2) and 0.57 mm thick sensors with ground yeast (3.09 mg cm(-2) areal density filtered with a 50 mu m mesh) shows a sensitivity of 4.5% Omega/Omega(0) decade-rad upon exposure to Cs-137. The minimum detectable dose (resolution) is 1 mrad. Fluorescence microscopy results suggest that it is primarily due to damaged membranes in the cell wall and mitochondria.

AB  - BACKGROUND The variability of metabolic parameters might have an impact on the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF).
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the variability of 4 metabolic components including systolic blood pressure (BP), glucose level, total cholesterol (TC) level, and body mass index (BMI) on the risk of AF in the healthy population without hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia.
   METHODS We identified 6,819,829 adult subjects without hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia who had >= 3 health checkups provided by the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation between 2005 and 2012. Glucose level, BP, TC level, and BMI were measured at each visit. Variability was defined as variability independent of the mean (VIM), and VIM of each parameter was divided into 4 groups. High variability was defined as having values in the highest quartile of each parameter.
   RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 5.3 +/- 1.1 years, 31,302 subjects were newly diagnosed with AF (0.86 per 1000 person-years). Subjects with the highest VIM quartile of BP, TC level, and BMI showed an increased risk of AF compared with those with the lowest VIM quartile, whereas glucose level variability had a marginal association. The composite of the high variability of metabolic parameters showed a graded risk of AF. After multivariable adjustment, subjects having 1, 2, 3, and 4 parameters of the highest VIM had an similar to 7%, 13%, 20%, and 35% increased risk of AF compared with those without any highest variability of metabolic parameters.
   CONCLUSION The variability of metabolic parameters showed a close association with the risk of AF in those without cardiovascular comorbidities.

AB  - Background-Long-term continuous cardiac monitoring would aid in the early diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation (AF). This study examined the accuracy of a novel approach for AF detection using photo-plethysmography signals measured from a wrist-based wearable device.
   Methods and Results-ECG and contemporaneous pulse data were collected from 2 cohorts of AF patients: AF patients (n=20) undergoing electrical cardioversion (ECV) and AF patients (n=40) that were prescribed for 24 hours ECG Holter in outpatient settings (HOL). Photo-plethysmography and acceleration data were collected at the wrist and processed to determine the inter-pulse interval and discard inter-pulse intervals in presence of motion artifacts. A Markov model was deployed to assess the probability of AF given irregular pattern in inter-pulse interval sequences. The AF detection algorithm was evaluated against clinical rhythm annotations of AF based on ECG interpretation. Photo-plethysmography recordings from apparently healthy volunteers (n=120) were used to establish the false positive AF detection rate of the algorithm. A total of 42 and 855 hours (AF: 21 and 323 hours) of photo-plethysmography data were recorded in the ECV and HOL cohorts, respectively. AF was detected with >96% accuracy (ECV, sensitivity=97%; HOL, sensitivity=93%; both with specificity=100%). Because of motion artifacts, the algorithm did not provide AF classification for 44 +/- 16% of the monitoring period in the HOL group. In healthy controls, the algorithm demonstrated a <0.2% false positive AF detection rate.
   Conclusions-A novel AF detection algorithm using pulse data from a wrist-wearable device can accurately discriminate rhythm irregularities caused by AF from normal rhythm.

AB  - Successful self-management of diabetes requires Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs). These CGMs have several limitations such as being invasive, expensive and limited in terms of use. Many techniques, in vain, have been proposed to overcome these limitations. Nowadays, with the help of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technologies, researchers are working to find alternative solutions. They succeed to predict hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia peaks using Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, they failed to use it to estimate the Blood Glucose Concentration (BGC) directly and in real time. Three patients with 08 days of measurements from the D1namo dataset contributed to the study. A new technique has been proposed to estimate the BGC curves based on ECG signals. We used a convolutional neural network to segment the different regions of ECG signals as well as we extracted ECG features that were required for the next step. Then, five regression models have been employed to estimate BGC using as input sixth ECG parameters. We were able to segment the ECG signals with an accuracy of 94% using the convolutional neural network algorithm. The best performance among all simulated models was provided by Exponential Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values of 0.32, 0.41, 0.67 and R-squared (R-2) values of 98%, 80%, and 70% for patients 01, 02 and 03 respectively. The method indicates the potential use of ECG wearable devices as non-invasive for continuous blood glucose monitoring, which is affordable and durable.

AB  - Purpose: Inertial-based trackers have become a common tool in data capture for ambulatory studies that aim at characterizing physical activity. Many systems that perform remote recording of accelerometer data use commercial trackers and black-box aggregation algorithms, often resulting in data that are locked into proprietary formats and metrics that make later replication or comparison difficult. Methods: The primary purpose of this manuscript is to validate an open-source ambulatory assessment system that consists of hardware devices, algorithms, and software components of our approach. We report on two validation experiments, one lab-based treadmill study on a convenience sample of 16 volunteers and one 'in vivo' study with 28 volunteers suffering from diabetes or cardiovascular disease. Results: A comparison between data from ActiGraph GT9X trackers and our proposed system reveals that the original inertial sensor signals at the wrist strongly correlate (Pearson correlation coefficients for raw inertial sensor signals of 0.97 in the controlled treadmill-walking setting) and that estimated steps from an open-source wrist-based detection approach correlate with the hip-worn ActiGraph output (average Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.81 for minute-wise comparisons of detected steps) in day-long ambulatory data. Conclusion: Recording inertial sensor data in a standardized form and relying on open-source algorithms on these data form a promising methodology that ensures that datasets can be replicated or enriched long after the wearable trackers have been decommissioned.

AB  - Purpose: To perform a prospective trial testing the feasibility and utility of acquiring activity data as a measure of health status during concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
   Methods and Materials: Ambulatory patients who were planned for treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for cancers of the head and neck, lung, or gastrointestinal tract were provided with activity monitors before treatment initiation. Patients were asked to wear the devices continuously throughout the radiation therapy course. Step count data were downloaded weekly during radiation therapy and 2 and 4 weeks after radiation therapy completion. The primary objective was to demonstrate feasibility, defined as collection of step counts for 80% of the days during study subjects' radiation therapy courses. Secondary objectives included establishing step count as a dynamic predictor of unplanned hospitalization risk.
   Results: Thirty-eight enrolled patients were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Primary diagnoses included head and neck cancer (n=11), lung cancer (n=13), and a variety of gastrointestinal cancers (n=14). Step data were collected for 1524 of 1613 days (94%) during patients' radiation therapy courses. Fourteen patients were hospitalized during radiation therapy or within 4 weeks of radiation therapy completion. Cox regression modeling demonstrated a significant association between recent step counts (3-day average) and hospitalization risk, with a 38% reduction in the risk of hospitalization for every 1000 steps taken each day (hazard ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.83, P=.002). Inferior quality of life scores and impaired performance status were not associated with increased hospitalization risk.
   Conclusion: Continuous activity monitoring during concurrent chemoradiotherapy is feasible and well-tolerated. Step counts may serve as powerful, objective, and dynamic indicators of hospitalization risk. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Nocturia has been reported as a risk factor for mortality. However, evidence is limited and has a high risk of bias. We evaluated the association between nocturia and mortality using longitudinal data from the general Japanese population.
   Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the Nagahama Cohort Project, a longitudinal, general population cohort study. Nocturia was measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score. Mortality data were obtained from the Basic Resident Register in Nagahama City. We used Cox proportional hazard models and time-varying covariates at baseline and 5-year followup to analyze the association between nocturia and mortality.
   Results: We analyzed 9,762 participants (median age 56.8 years, male 32.8%). The prevalence rates of nocturnal voiding at 0, 1, 2 and 3 or more times were 44.3%, 39.1%, 11.7% and 4.9%, respectively. A total of 263 participants died. Followup assessment was performed 3,224 (SD 537) days after baseline. According to multivariable Cox proportional hazard regressions, mortality increased dose dependently with the nocturnal voiding frequency as HR 1.46 for 1 time (95% CI 1.02-2.09), HR 1.85 for 2 times (95% CI 1.23-2.77) and HR 2.06 (95% CI 1.28-3.32) for 3 or more times in comparison with 0 times (p for trend=0.00084). In the time varying Cox proportional hazard regression the association was still significant (p for trend=0.0017).

AB  - Surgical resections remain the primary curative interventions for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, lack of real-time intraoperative image guidance confines surgeons to subjective visual assessment of the surgical bed, leading to poor visualization of small positive nodules and the extension of diffuse HCC. To address this problem, we developed a wearable fluorescence imaging and display system (fluorescence goggle) for intraoperative imaging of HCCs in human patients. In this pilot study, both intravenous (IV) and transarterial hepatic (TAH) delivery of indocyanine green (ICG) were explored to facilitate fluorescence goggle-mediated HCC imaging. The results show that all primary tumors in patients (n = 4) who received TAH delivery of ICG were identified successfully by the fluorescence goggle. In addition, 6 satellite tumors were also detected by the goggle, 5 of which were neither identifiable via preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) nor by visual inspection and palpation. In the group (n = 5) that received ICG intravenously, only 2 of 6 tumors visible by preoperative MRI or CT were identified with the fluorescence goggle, demonstrating the limitation of this delivery route for a non-tumor-selective imaging agent. Comparative analysis shows that the HCC-to-liver florescence contrast detected by the goggle was significantly greater in patients that received TAN than IV delivery of ICG (P = 0.013). This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using the fluorescence goggle to identify multifocal lesion's and small tumor deposits using TAH ICG delivery in HCC patients.

AB  - There is the potential for high-dimensional information about patients collected in clinical trials (such as genomic, imaging, and data from wearable technologies) to be informative for the efficacy of a new treatment in situations where only a subset of patients benefits from the treatment. The adaptive signature design (ASD) method has been proposed for developing and testing the efficacy of a treatment in a high-efficacy patient group (the sensitive group) using genetic data. The method requires selection of three tuning parameters which may be highly computationally expensive. We propose a variation to the ASD method, the cross-validated risk scores (CVRS) design method, that does not require selection of any tuning parameters. The method is based on computing a risk score for each patient and dividing them into clusters using a nonparametric clustering procedure. We assess the properties of CVRS against the originally proposed cross-validated ASD using simulation data and a real psychiatry trial. CVRS, as assessed for various sample sizes and response rates, has a substantial reduction in the computational time required. In many simulation scenarios, there is a substantial improvement in the ability to correctly identify the sensitive group and the power of the design to detect a treatment effect in the sensitive group. We illustrate the application of the CVRS method on the psychiatry trial.

AB  - Clinical trials are a fundamental tool used to evaluate the efficacy and safety of new drugs and medical devices and other health system interventions. The traditional clinical trials system acts as a quality funnel for the development and implementation of new drugs, devices and health system interventions. The concept of a "digital clinical trial" involves leveraging digital technology to improve participant access, engagement, trial-related measurements, and/or interventions, enable concealed randomized intervention allocation, and has the potential to transform clinical trials and to lower their cost. In April 2019, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) held a workshop bringing together experts in clinical trials, digital technology, and digital analytics to discuss strategies to implement the use of digital technologies in clinical trials while considering potential challenges. This position paper builds on this workshop to describe the current state of the art for digital clinical trials including (1) defining and outlining the composition and elements of digital trials; (2) describing recruitment and retention using digital technology; (3) outlining data collection elements including mobile health, wearable technologies, application programming interfaces (APIs), digital transmission of data, and consideration of regulatory oversight and guidance for data security, privacy, and remotely provided informed consent; (4) elucidating digital analytics and data science approaches leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms; and (5) setting future priorities and strategies that should be addressed to successfully harness digital methods and the myriad benefits of such technologies for clinical research.

AB  - Study Objectives: Growing interest in monitoring sleep and well-being has created a market for consumer home sleep monitoring devices. Additionally, sleep disorder diagnostics, and sleep and dream research would benefit from reliable and valid home sleep monitoring devices. Yet, majority of currently available home sleep monitoring devices lack validation. In this study, the sleep parameter assessment accuracy of Beddit Sleep Tracker (BST), an unobtrusive and non-wearable sleep monitoring device based on ballistocardiography, was evaluated by comparing it with polysomnography (PSG) measures. We measured total sleep time (TST), sleep onset latency (SOL), wake after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep efficiency (SE). Additionally, we examined whether BST can differentiate sleep stages.
   Methods: We performed sleep studies simultaneously with PSG and BST in ten healthy young adults (5 female/5 male) during two non-consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory.
   Results: BST was able to distinguish SOL with some accuracy. However, it underestimated WASO and thus overestimated TST and SE. Also, it failed to discriminate between non-rapid eye movement sleep stages and did not detect the rapid eye movement sleep stage.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that BST is not a valid device to monitor sleep. Consumers should be careful in interpreting the conclusions on sleep quality and efficiency provided by the device.

AB  - Despite the rapid development of flexible wearable devices, the current ionic skins still remain a challenge to simultaneously realize visual dynamic display, multi-signal sensing, together with asymmetrical adhesive, antibacterial and self-powered functions for motion monitoring, thus severely limiting their practical applications in artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction. Herein, a multifunctional interactive ionic skin (MIIS) with these attractive functions is first presented by an asymmetrical double-layer structural color hydrogel (ADSCH) for visual and digital detecting human motions in real-time. The ADSCH is constructed by combining a highly stretchable, inverse opal structural polycationic hydrogel as the upper layer with a soft, adhesive polyanionic hydrogel as the lower layer using the sacrificial template and layer-by-layer polymerization methods respectively. The resultant ADSCH not only possesses electrical signal monitoring through the change of resistance, but also shows intuitive optical sensing by regulating the lattice spacing of photonic crystal under external strain and pressure stimuli at wide ranges (0-500%; 0-40 kPa). More importantly, the ADSCH is concurrently integrated with outstanding asymmetrical adhesion (adhesion strength: ~30 kPa), antibacterial (log reduction: >4.44) and self-powered functions. Therefore, this study provides novel insights into for the design and fabrication of multifunctional interactive wearable devices.

AB  - This paper presents a concept of a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) user interface (smart button) that can sense a user's touch and provide multi-sensory tactile and acoustic feedbacks through a single electrical input signal. The DEA relies on a multi-layer layout, in which a layer detects user-driven deformations (touches) via custom-built capacitance sensing electronics, and the remaining layers are used to provide actuation (audio-tactile feedbacks). Building upon a recently presented principle, combined tactile and acoustic feedbacks are produced by concurrently exciting different vibration modes of the same active membrane over different frequency ranges. An integrated demonstrator setup is presented, which includes a DEA, an acoustic enclosure, compact sensing and driving electronics. A characterization of the prototype is conducted, including an analysis of the sound pressure level, the force/stroke output at lower working frequencies, the ability to sense deformations with different profiles and produce combined audio-tactile outputs. Compared to previous works on multi-function DEAs, the system presented in this paper provides largely improved sensing performance (with lower working voltage) and features a deeper level of integration (with small-scale custom sensing electronics, and logics embedded onto scalable microcontrollers) and is thus specifically optimised for user-interaction applications. On this end, tests with users are presented here for the first time, which allowed evaluating the subjective perception of the interface's feedbacks. By means of further optimisation and miniaturisation of the power/sensing electronics and structural components, the layout and multifunction DEA principle presented here might lead, in the future, to the development of DEA-based smart buttons for active surfaces, or portable/wearable user interfaces and communicators.

AB  - BackgroundThe venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) score is a multi-organ Doppler approach to assess venous congestion. Despite growing use of VExUS in research and clinical practice, other veins can be visualized to assess for venous hypertension, which may overcome acquisition barriers of the VExUS exam. In this pilot, observational study, we used a wearable Doppler ultrasound to assess the relationship between jugular venous Doppler and the VExUS score under different preload conditions. We hypothesized that jugular Doppler morphology would accurately distinguish preload conditions, that it would most closely relate to the hepatic venous Doppler morphology in the fully supine position and that the VExUS score would be influenced by preload condition.ResultsWe recruited 15 healthy volunteers with no cardiovascular history. Preload change was achieved using a tilt-table with three positions: supine, fully upright, and 30-degree head-down tilt. In each position, a VExUS score was performed; furthermore, inferior vena collapsibility and sphericity index were calculated. At the same time, jugular venous Doppler was captured by a novel, wireless, wearable ultrasound system. A continuous jugular venous Doppler morphology was 96% accurate for detecting the low preload condition. The jugular venous Doppler morphology was highly correlated with the hepatic vein, but only in the supine position. Gravitational position did not significantly affect the sphericity index or the VExUS score.ConclusionsThe jugular vein Doppler morphology was able to accurately distinguish low from high preload conditions in healthy volunteers. Comparisons between VExUS Doppler morphologies and other veins should occur in the supine position when gravitational pressure gradients are minimized; finally, different preload conditions in healthy subjects did not affect the VExUS score.

AB  - Background: Septic arthritis is an infrequent disease although very important due to the possibility of disastrous outcomes if treatment is not adequately established. Adequate information concerning the epidemiology of septic arthritis is still lacking due to the uncommon nature of the disease as well as the struggle to establish a correct case-definition.
   Objective: To epidemiologically characterize the population seen at Hospital das Clinicas, University of Sao Paulo with a diagnosis of septic arthritis between 2006 and 2011.
   Methods: Sixty-one patients diagnosed with septic arthritis of the knee between 2006 and 2011 were retrospectively evaluated. The patients' clinical and epidemiological characteristics, the microorganisms that caused the infection and the patients' treatment and evolution were analyzed.
   Results: Septic arthritis of the knee was more common among men, with distribution across a variety of age ranges. Most diagnoses were made through positive synovial fluid cultures. The most prevalent clinical comorbidities were systemic arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and the most commonly reported joint disease was osteoarthritis. Staphylococcus aureus was the prevailing pathogen. Fever was present in 36% of the cases. All patients presented elevation in inflammatory tests. Gram staining was positive in only 50.8% of the synovial fluid samples analyzed. Six patients presented complications and unfavorable evolution of their condition.
   Conclusion: S. aureus is still the most common pathogen in acute knee infections in our environment. Gram staining, absence of fever and normal leukocyte count cannot be used to rule out septic arthritis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

AB  - According to the reports on aging population, the number of elderly people without a caregiver has increased. These people are always at high risks of adverse incidents such as increased blood pressure, a variety of stroke-leading health issues, as well as other accidents resulting in body instability and eventually hazardous falls. An uncontrolled fall can result in far worse situations than the original cause itself, if the unattended patient is not promptly transmitted to a treatment center. To reduce the adverse consequences of such unfortunate events, the demand for intelligent systems to prevent, detect, and report the incidents has significantly increased during the past decade. So far, many studies have been proposed considering different aspects of the fall detection problem, from simple applied systems to complex ones regarding the detection algorithm and feature extraction methods. In this paper, a framework for smart detection, identification and notification of elderly falls is introduced. Using a personal smartphone, the tri-axial acceleration of the person's movements is measured, and the related features are extracted following a pre-processing and timing the samples with a predefined window. The deep belief network (DBN) is used next for training and testing the system using two public datasets, with nine classes of fall and one class of daily activity. Simulation results on two generic datasets, TFall and MobiFall, show an accuracy of 97.56% sensitivity and 97.03% specificity, which is promising compared to nine other related studies.

AB  - Despite the popularity of commercially available wearable activity monitors (WAMs), there is a paucity of consistent methodology for analyzing large amounts of accelerometer data from these devices. This multimethod study aimed to inform appropriate Fitbit wear thresholds for physical activity (PA) outcomes assessment in a sample of 616 low-income, majority Latina patients with obesity enrolled in a behavioral weight-loss intervention. Secondly, this study aimed to understand intervention participants' barriers to Fitbit use. We applied a heart rate (HR) criterion (>= 10 h/day) and a step count (SC) criterion (>= 1000 steps/day) to 100 days of continuous activity monitor data. We examined the prevalence of valid wear and PA outcomes between analytic subgroups of participants who met the HR criterion, SC criterion, or both. We undertook qualitative analysis of research staff notes and participant interviews to explore barriers to valid Fitbit data collection. Overall, one in three participants did not meet the SC criterion for valid wear in Weeks 1 and 13; however, we found the SC criterion to be more inclusive of participants who did not use a smartphone than the HR criterion. Older age, higher body mass index (BMI), barriers to smartphone use, device storage issues, and negative emotional responses to WAM-based self-monitoring may predict higher proportions of invalid WAM data in weight-loss intervention research.

AB  - Motivation: Personalized medicine aims at providing patient-tailored therapeutics based on multi-type data toward improved treatment outcomes. Chronotherapy that consists in adapting drug administration to the patient's circadian rhythms may be improved by such approach. Recent clinical studies demonstrated large variability in patients' circadian coordination and optimal drug timing. Consequently, new eHealth platforms allow the monitoring of circadian biomarkers in individual patients through wearable technologies (rest-activity, body temperature), blood or salivary samples (melatonin, cortisol) and daily questionnaires (food intake, symptoms). A current clinical challenge involves designing a methodology predicting from circadian biomarkers the patient peripheral circadian clocks and associated optimal drug timing. The mammalian circadian timing system being largely conserved between mouse and humans yet with phase opposition, the study was developed using available mouse datasets.
   Results: We investigated at the molecular scale the influence of systemic regulators (e.g. temperature, hormones) on peripheral clocks, through a model learning approach involving systems biology models based on ordinary differential equations. Using as prior knowledge our existing circadian clock model, we derived an approximation for the action of systemic regulators on the expression of three core-clock genes: Bmal1, Per2 and Rev-Erba. These time profiles were then fitted with a population of models, based on linear regression. Best models involved a modulation of either Bmal1 or Per2 transcription most likely by temperature or nutrient exposure cycles. This agreed with biological knowledge on temperature-dependent control of Per2 transcription. The strengths of systemic regulations were found to be significantly different according to mouse sex and genetic background.

AB  - In the context of an integrated Lab-on-PCB wearable patch extracting interstitial fluid from the patient via integrated microneedles, the requirements from the integrated biosensing part are quite special compared to static glucose electrochemical biosensors. Hence, in this study, a fully PCB-integrated enzymatic glucose quantification Lab-on-Chip device is presented and evaluated considering these special requirements for such a patch implementation: a) range and limit of detection compatible with interstitial fluid glucose levels of diabetic patients and b) effect of sample flow rate on the biosensing platform performance. This work employs a chronoamperometric approach for glucose detection based on covalently immobilized glucose oxidase on PCB-integrated electrodes. The chronoamperometric measurements show that this platform exhibits uM range sensitivity, high specificity, and good reproducibility, and the assay can detect glucose from 10 mu M to 9 mM with a lower limit of detection of 10 mu M. The demonstrated detection range under continuous flow proved compatible with interstitial fluid glucose levels of diabetic patients. The sample-to-answer time of our Lab-on-PCB device is less than 1 min (sample delivery of few seconds and 20 s for electrochemical measurement), employing sample volumes of 50 mu L in this instance. Increased flow rates substantially improve the platform sensitivity (1.1 mu A/mM @0 mu L/min to 6.2 mu A/mM @10 mu L/min), with the measured current increasing exponentially to the flow rate, as opposed to the theoretically expected much lower dependence. This work demonstrates the feasibility of Lab-on-PCB patches in terms of biosensing performance, paving the way for the first cost-effective, painless diabetes management microsystem.

AB  - Background: Mobile devices are increasingly used to collect location-based information from individuals about their physical activities, dietary intake, environmental exposures, and mental well-being. Such research, which typically uses wearable devices or mobile phones to track location, benefits from the growing availability of fine-grained data regarding human mobility. However, little is known about the comparative geospatial accuracy of such devices.
   Objective: In this study, we compared the data quality of location information collected from two mobile devices that determine location in different ways-a global positioning system (GPS) watch and a mobile phone with Google's Location History feature enabled.
   Methods: A total of 21 chronically ill participants carried both devices, which generated digital traces of locations, for 28 days. A mobile phone based brief ecological momentary assessment (EMA) survey asked participants to manually report their location at 4 random times throughout each day. Participants also took part in qualitative interviews and completed surveys twice during the study period in which they reviewed recent mobile phone and watch trace data to compare the devices' trace data with their memory of their activities on those days. Trace data from the devices were compared on the basis of (1) missing data days, (2) reasons for missing data, (3) distance between the route data collected for matching day and the associated EMA survey locations, and (4) activity space total area and density surfaces.
   Results: The watch resulted in a much higher proportion of missing data days (P<.001), with missing data explained by technical differences between the devices as well as participant behaviors. The mobile phone was significantly more accurate in detecting home locations (P=.004) and marginally more accurate (P=.07) for all types of locations combined. The watch data resulted in a smaller activity space area and more accurately recorded outdoor travel and recreation.
   Conclusions: The most suitable mobile device for location-based health research depends on the particular study objectives. Furthermore, data generated from mobile devices, such as GPS phones and smartwatches, require careful analysis to ensure quality and completeness. Studies that seek precise measurement of outdoor activity and travel, such as measuring outdoor physical activity or exposure to localized environmental hazards, would benefit from the use of GPS devices. Conversely, studies that aim to account for time within buildings at home or work, or those that document visits to particular places (such as supermarkets, medical facilities, or fast food restaurants), would benefit from the greater precision demonstrated by the mobile phone in recording indoor activities.

AB  - Implantable medical devices (IMDs) enable patients to monitor their health anytime and receive treatment anywhere. However, due to the limited capacity of a battery, their functionalities are restricted, and the devices may not achieve their intended potential fully. The most promising way to solve this limited capacity problem is wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. In this study, a WPT based implantable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring device that continuously records ECG data has been proposed, and its effectiveness is verified through an animal experiment using a rat model. Our proposed device is designed to be of size 24 x 27 x 8 mm, and it is small enough to be implanted in the rat. The device transmits data continuously using a low power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication technology. To charge the battery wirelessly, transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) antennas were designed and fabricated. The animal experiment results clearly showed that our WPT system enables the device to monitor the ECG of a heart in various conditions continuously, while transmitting all ECG data in real-time.

AB  - Background. Solar radiations that reach the Earth can be divided into ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared. Overexposure to these radiations can facilitate adverse skin diseases such as sunburn, skin cancer, and photoaging. People who drive vehicles for an extended period are likely to develop skin cancer in the exposed body area. Method. This research proposes a wearable protective device around the upper arm to measure the transmitted radiation through the front and the side windows. A novel skin type classification algorithm using a color sensor was created to provide an accurate skin type identification. Also, the device was programmed to calculate the time before sunburn occurrence based on the ultraviolet index, sunscreen's sun protection factor, and skin type. Results. The prototype was tested inside a Toyota Camry model 2001 vehicle with an accuracy of 97%. The front window had transmitted more infrared radiation compared to the side window. The highest recorded value was 76.76 mW/cm(2). On the other hand, the side window had transmitted more ultraviolet compared to the front window as it lacks the protective polyvinyl butyral layer that the front window has. The highest recorded ultraviolet index was 3.5. Conclusion. These results highlight the importance of wearing the designed solar band and using appropriate UV and IR protection while driving a vehicle to prevent skin diseases from occurring.

AB  - Smoking cessation treatments that are easily accessible and deliver intervention content at vulnerable moments (e.g., high negative affect) have great potential to impact tobacco abstinence. The current study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a multi-component Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) for smoking cessation. Daily smokers interested in quitting were consented to participate in a 6-week cessation study. Visit 1 occurred 4 days pre-quit, Visit 2 was on the quit day, Visit 3 occurred 3 days post-quit, Visit 4 was 10 days post -quit, and Visit 5 was 28 days post-quit. During the first 2 weeks (Visits 1-4), the JITAI delivered brief mind-fulness/motivational strategies via smartphone in real-time based on negative affect or smoking behavior detected by wearable sensors. Participants also attended 5 in-person visits, where brief cessation counseling (Visits 1-4) and nicotine replacement therapy (Visits 2-5) were provided. Outcomes were feasibility and acceptability; biochemically-confirmed abstinence was also measured. Participants (N = 43) were 58.1 % female (AgeMean = 49.1, mean cigarettes per day = 15.4). Retention through follow-up was high (83.7 %). For par-ticipants with available data (n = 38), 24 (63 %) met the benchmark for sensor wearing, among whom 16 (67 %) completed at least 60 % of strategies. Perceived ease of wearing sensors (Mean = 5.1 out of 6) and treatment satisfaction (Mean = 3.6 out of 4) were high. Biochemically-confirmed abstinence was 34 % at Visit 4 and 21 % at Visit 5. Overall, the feasibility of this novel multi-component intervention for smoking cessation was mixed but acceptability was high. Future studies with improved technology will decrease participant burden and better detect key intervention moments.

AB  - Background Informal sector electronic waste (e-waste) recovery produces toxic emissions resulting from burning e-waste to recover valuable metals.
   Objectives To identify high-risk worker groups by measuring relative levels of personal inhalation exposure to particulate matter (PM) of fine (<= 2.5 mu m) and coarse (2.5-10 mu m) fractions (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10, respectively) across work activities among e-waste workers, and to assess how wind conditions modify levels of PM by activity and site location.
   Methods At the Agbogbloshie e-waste site, 170 partial-shift PM samples and time-activity data were collected from participants (N = 105) enrolled in the GeoHealth cohort study. Personal sampling included continuous measures of size-specific PM from the worker's breathing zone and time-activity derived from wearable cameras. Linear mixed models were used to estimate changes in personal PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 associated with activities and evaluate effect modification by wind conditions.
   Results Mean (+/- standard deviation) personal PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 concentrations were 80 (+/- 81) and 123 (+/- 139) mu g m(-3), respectively. The adjusted mean PM2.5 concentration for burning e-waste was 88 mu g m(-3), a 28% increase above concentrations during non-recovery activities (such as eating). Transportation-related and burning activities were associated with the highest PM2.5-10 concentrations. Frequent changes in wind direction were associated with higher PM2.5 concentrations when burning, and high wind speeds with higher PM2.5-10 concentrations when dismantling e-waste downwind of the burning zone.

AB  - Sleep apnea (SA) is a very common disease with serious health consequences, yet is very under-diagnosed, partially because of the high cost and limited accessibility of in-laboratory polysomnography (PSG). The purpose of this work is to introduce a newly developed portable system for the diagnosis of SA at home that is both reliable and easy to use. The system includes personal devices for recording breath sounds and airflow during sleep and diagnostic algorithms to process the recorded data. The data capturing device consists of a wearable face frame with an embedded electronic module featuring a unidirectional microphone, a differential microphone preamplifier, a microcontroller with an onboard differential analogue to digital converter, and a microSD memory card. The device provides continuous data capturing for 8 h. Upon completion of the recording session, the memory card is returned to a location for acoustic analysis. We recruited 49 subjects who used the device independently at home, after which each subject answered a usability questionnaire. Random data samples were selected to measure the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a gauge of hardware functionality. A subset of 11 subjects used the device on 2 different nights and their results were compared to examine diagnostic reproducibility. Independent of those, system's performance was evaluated against PSG in the lab environment in 32 subject. The overall success rate of applying the device in un-attended settings was 94 % and the overall rating for ease-of-use was 'excellent'. Signal examination showed excellent capturing of breath sounds with an average SNR of 31.7 dB. Nine of the 11 (82 %) subjects had equivalent results on both nights, which is consistent with reported inter-night variability. The system showed 96 % correlation with simultaneously performed in-lab PSG. Conclusion: Our results suggest excellent usability and performance of this system and provide a strong rationale to further improve it and test its robustness in a larger study.

AB  - Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has demonstrated versatile biomedical applications, ranging from tracking single cells to monitoring whole-body dynamics of small animals and diagnosing human breast cancer. Currently, PAT has two major implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). PACT uses a multi-element ultrasonic array for parallel detection, which is relatively complex and expensive. In contrast, PAM requires point-by-point scanning with a single-element detector, which has a limited imaging throughput. The trade-off between the system cost and throughput demands a new imaging method. To this end, we have developed photoacoustic topography through an ergodic relay (PATER). PATER can capture a wide-field image with only a single-element ultrasonic detector upon a single laser shot. This protocol describes the detailed procedures for PATER system construction, including component selection, equipment setup and system alignment. A step-by-step guide for in vivo imaging of a mouse brain is provided as an example application. Data acquisition, image reconstruction and troubleshooting procedures are also elaborated. It takes similar to 130 min to carry out this protocol, including similar to 60 min for both calibration and snapshot wide-field data acquisition using a laser with a 2-kHz pulse repetition rate. PATER offers low-cost snapshot wide-field imaging of fast dynamics, such as visualizing blood pulse wave propagation and tracking melanoma tumor cell circulation in mice in vivo. We envision that PATER will have wide biomedical applications and anticipate that the compact size of the setup will allow it to be further developed as a wearable device to monitor human vital signs.

AB  - Objective Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has been a fast-growing biomedical imaging modality in recent years. Absorbers are imaged in biological tissue by detecting laser-induced ultrasound waves via PAI. This provides hemodynamic information for the diagnosis of tumors, strokes, and other critical diseases. A typical photoacoustic microscope uses piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers to detect the photoacoustic signals. However, owing to the tradeoff between sensitivity and sensor size, building a miniaturized photoacoustic microscope with superior imaging capability is highly challenging. Therefore, the applications of PAI in wearable and endoscopic applications are limited. Our research group has developed a new optical ultrasonic sensor using a self-heterodyne fiber laser as the acoustically sensitive element. However, the laser, optical amplifier, photodetector, and signal demodulator may all cause noise and limit the detection capability. This study analyzes the noise characteristics and constructs a high-performance fiber-based photoacoustic microscope. This imaging probe can be used as a gastrointestinal endoscope for tumor screening or as a head-mounted microscope for brain imaging in a free-moving state.
   Methods We exploited a compact fiber laser as the ultrasound sensor. Ultrasound waves can deform the sensor and induce a change in the lasing frequency. To measure the acoustic response, we used both x- and y-polarized light and beat them at the photodetector to generate a radio-frequency. The variation in lasing frequency was then measured at radio frequency using modern electronics with high resolution. Here, we theoretically analyzed the noise of the fiber sensor, optical amplifier, photodetector, and signal demodulation acquisition module in the ultrasonic detection system. By measuring the noise n(0), beat signal power P-rf, and frequency noise Delta f(noise) with different input optical powers, we examined the dependence of the noise on the input power. Further, we implemented a photoacoustic microscope using an optical sensor for ultrasound detection and imaged the blood vessels in a biological sample. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were also measured while varying the input power of the sensing light.
   Results and Discussions First, we calculated the noise levels of the fiber laser and optical amplifier, shot and thermal noises of the photodetector, and the noise of the signal demodulation acquisition module (Fig. 2) . We found that when the input optical power is less than 8.5 mW, the noise from the data-acquisition system accounts for a large proportion of the total system noise and has a main contribution to the noise; when the input optical power exceeds 8.5 mW, the noise of laser and optical amplifier dominates. We then measured the system noise n(0), beat signal power P-rf, and image frequency noise Delta f(noise) as the functions of input optical power (Fig 3) . When the input optical power increases to more than 10 mW, the frequency noise Delta f(noise) approaches its minimum and the root-mean-square of Delta f(noise) is similar to 44 kHz. In photoacoustic microscopy, the optical ultrasound sensor was used to detect laser-induced ultrasound waves. We imaged a mouse ear in vivo with different input powers (Fig 5) . When the input optical power is 1.7 mW, the peak-to-peak frequency noise is 185 kHz. When the input optical power increases to 15.7 mW, the noise is reduced to 110 kHz and the imaging SNR is enhanced by 4.5 dB.
   Conclusions This paper studies the noise characteristics of a laser-based optical ultrasound sensor. We determine the dependence of noise n(0) of the optical fiber ultrasonic sensor system and that of the beat signal frequency noise Delta f(noise) on the input optical power P-rf of the signal light. By increasing P-rf, the frequency noise can be considerably reduced, yielding an enhancement in the SNR. The frequency fluctuation is reduced from 185 to 110 kHz when the input power is increased to 15.7 mW. The corresponding noise equivalent pressure (NEP) is reduced from 32.9 to 19.5 Pa, and the imaging SNR is enhanced by 4.5 dB.
   Optical fiber is thin, flexible, and suitable for both endoscopy and wearable instrumentation. This study demonstrates that optical fiber technology opens new possibilities to implement small high-performance photoacoustic imaging modalities. Here, we have considerably improved the sensitivity of the optical ultrasound sensor, thus providing better imaging results. With the improved sensor, we aim to implement a photoacoustic endoscope for gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis and a head-mounted photoacoustic microscope for free-state neuroimaging.

AB  - Robot-assisted training provides an effective approach to neurological injury rehabilitation. To meet the challenge of hand rehabilitation after neurological injuries, this study presents an advanced myoelectric pattern recognition scheme for real-time intention-driven control of a hand exoskeleton. The developed scheme detects and recognizes user's intention of six different hand motions using four channels of surface electromyography (EMG) signals acquired from the forearm and hand muscles, and then drives the exoskeleton to assist the user accomplish the intended motion. The system was tested with eight neurologically intact subjects and two individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). The overall control accuracy was 98.1 +/- 4.9% for the neurologically intact subjects and 90.0 +/- 13.9% for the SCI subjects. The total lag of the system was approximately 250 ms including data acquisition, transmission and processing. One SCI subject also participated in training sessions in his second and third visits. Both the control accuracy and efficiency tended to improve. These results show great potential for applying the advanced myoelectric pattern recognition control of the wearable robotic hand system toward improving hand function after neurological injuries.

AB  - Background There is a need for novel alcohol biosensors that are accurate, able to detect alcohol concentration close in time to consumption, and feasible and acceptable for many clinical and research applications. We evaluated the field accuracy and tolerability of novel (BACTrack Skyn) and established (Alcohol Monitoring Systems SCRAM CAM) alcohol biosensors. Methods The sensor and diary data were collected in a larger study of a biofeedback intervention and compared observationally in the present sub-study. Participants (high-risk drinkers, 40% female; median age 21) wore both Skyn and SCRAM CAM sensors for 1-6 days and were instructed to drink as usual. Data from the first cohort of participants (N = 27; 101 person-days) were used to find threshold values of transdermal alcohol that classified each day as meeting or not meeting defined levels of drinking (heavy, above-moderate, any). These values were used to develop scoring metrics that were subsequently tested using the second cohort (N = 20; 57 person-days). Data from both biosensors were compared to mobile diary self-report to evaluate sensitivity and specificity in relation to a priori standards established in the literature. Results Skyn classification rules for Cohort #1 within 3 months of device shipment showed excellent sensitivity for heavy drinking (94%) and exceeded expectations for above-moderate and any drinking (78% and 69%, respectively), while specificity met expectations (91%). However, classification worsened when Cohort #1 devices >= 3 months from shipment were tested (area under curve for receiver operator characteristic 0.87 vs. 0.79) and the derived classification threshold when applied to Cohort #2 was inadequately specific (70%). Skyn tolerability metrics were excellent and exceeded the SCRAM CAM (p <= 0.001). Conclusions Skyn tolerability was favorable and accuracy rules were internally derivable but did not yield useful scoring metrics going forward across device lots and months of usage.

AB  - The energy in wireless sensor networks is considered a scarce commodity, especially in scenarios where it is difficult or impossible to provide supplementary energy sources once the initially available energy is used up. Even in cases where energy harvesting is feasible, effective energy utilization is still a crucial step for prolonging the network lifetime. Enhancement of life-time through efficient energy management is one of the essential ingredients underlining the design of any credible wireless sensor network. In this paper, we propose a sensor selection method using a novel and unsupervised neural network structure referred to as partly-informed sparse autoencoder (PISAE) that aims to reconstruct all sensor readings from a select few. The PISAE comprises three submodules, namely: the gate (which selects the most important sensors), encoder (encodes and compresses the data from select sensors), and decoder (decodes the output of the encoder and regenerates the readings of all initial sensors). Our approach relies on the premise that many sensors are redundant because their readings are spatially and temporally correlated and are predictable from the readings of a few other sensors in the network. Thus, overall network reliability and lifetime are enhanced by putting sensors with redundant readings to sleep without losing significant information. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method on three benchmark datasets and compare with existing results. The experimental results indicate the superiority of our approach compared with existing approaches in terms of accuracy and lifetime extension factor.

AB  - Sensors fabricated on fabrics provide an elevated ease of use for wearable sensors. Such sensors will play a critical role in detecting the elevations in the concentrations of biochemical markers in human sweat. The ability of making such measurements is becoming an important tool for non-invasive and real-time health monitoring. We present a yarn-based flexible and superwettable electrochemical immunosensing strategy for highly selective and sensitive detection of cortisol in sweat. ZnO nanorods (ZnONRs)-coated flexible carbon yarns were prepared by using a hydrothermal method for immobilizing specific anti-cortisol antibodies and used as an immunosensing platform for detecting sweat cortisol levels. The morphology, elemental composition, crystallinity, and specific surface area were analyzed by using analytical techniques such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy coupled energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (FE-SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. The ZnONRs integrated carbon yarns showed excellent mechanical stability and superwettable properties. The immunosensor exhibited a wide linear detection range from 1 fg/mL to 1 mu g/mL. The detection limits of the immunosensor were calculated to be between 0.45 and 0.098 fg/mL by using CV and DPV techniques, respectively. Additionally, cell viability studies were performed to investigate the biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of this carbon yarn ZnO sensing platform. The immunosensor was applied to measure the cortisol concentration in human sweat samples, and the outcomes were validated by using a chemiluminescent immunoassay system.

AB  - Importance Hip and knee arthroplasty are the most common inpatient surgical procedures for Medicare beneficiaries in the US, with substantial variation in cost and quality. Whether remote monitoring incorporating insights from behavioral science might help improve outcomes and increase value of care remains unknown. Objective To evaluate the effect of activity monitoring and bidirectional text messaging on the rate of discharge to home and clinical outcomes in patients receiving hip or knee arthroplasty. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial conducted between February 7, 2018, and April 15, 2019. The setting was 2 urban hospitals at an academic health system. Participants were patients aged 18 to 85 years scheduled to undergo hip or knee arthroplasty with a Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool score of 6 to 8. Interventions Eligible patients were randomized evenly to receive usual care (n = 153) or remote monitoring (n = 147). Those in the intervention arm who agreed received a wearable activity monitor to track step count, messaging about postoperative goals and milestones, pain score tracking, and connection to clinicians as needed. Patients assigned to receive monitoring were further randomized evenly to remote monitoring alone or remote monitoring with gamification and social support. Remote monitoring was offered before surgery, began at hospital discharge, and continued for 45 days postdischarge. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was discharge status (home vs skilled nursing facility or inpatient rehabilitation). Prespecified secondary outcomes included change in average daily step count and rehospitalizations. Results A total of 242 patients were analyzed (124 usual care, 118 intervention); median age was 66 years (interquartile range, 58-73 years); 78.1% were women, 45.5% were White, 43.4% were Black; and 81.4% in the intervention arm agreed to receive monitoring. There was no significant difference in the rate of discharge to home between the usual care arm (57.3%; 95% CI, 48.5%-65.9%) and the intervention arm (56.8%; 95% CI, 47.9%-65.7%) and no significant increase in step count in those receiving remote monitoring plus gamification and social support compared with remote monitoring alone. There was a statistically significant reduction in rehospitalization rate in the intervention arm (3.4%; 95% CI, 0.1%-6.7%) compared with the usual care arm (12.2%; 95% CI, 6.4%-18.0%) (P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, the remote monitoring program did not increase rate of discharge to home after hip or knee arthroplasty, and gamification and social support did not increase activity levels. There was a significant reduction in rehospitalizations among those receiving the intervention, which may have resulted from goal setting and connection to the care team.
   Question Can a remote monitoring intervention that incorporates principles of behavioral science improve outcomes and value of care among patients undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty? Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 242 patients, the remote monitoring program did not increase rate of discharge to home after hip and knee arthroplasty, and gamification and social support did not increase activity levels. However, a significant reduction in rehospitalizations among those assigned to the intervention was found. Meaning In this study, remote monitoring did not increase discharge to home, but goal setting and connection to the care team may have reduced rehospitalizations.
   This randomized clinical trial evaluates the effectiveness of activity monitoring and bidirectional text messaging on discharge to home and clinical outcomes after total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty among Medicare beneficiaries with intermediate risk of discharge to a facility.

AB  - Demands for precise health information tracking techniques are increasing, especially for daily dietry requirements to prevent obesity, diabetes, etc. Many commercially available sensors that detect dynamic motions of the body lack accuracy, while novel strain sensors at the research level mostly lack the capability to analyze measurements in real life conditions. Here, a stretchable, patch-type calorie expenditure measurement system is demonstrated that integrates an ultrasensitive crack-based strain sensor and Bluetooth-enabled wireless communication circuit to offer both accurate measurements and practical diagnosis of motion. The crack-based strain gauge transformed into a pop-up-shaped structure provides reliable measurements and broad range of strain (approximate to 100%). Combined with the stretchable analysis circuit, the skin attachable tool translates variation of the knee flexion angle into calorie expenditure amount, using relative resistance change (R/R-0) data from the flexible sensor. As signals from the knee joint angular movement translates velocity and walking/running behavior, the total amount of calorie expenditure is accurately analyzed. Finally, theoretical, experimental, and simulation analysis of signal stability, dynamic noises, and calorie expenditure calculation obtained from the device during exercise are demonstrated. For further applications, the devices are expected to be used in broader range of dynamic motion of the body for diagnosis of abnormalities and for rehabilitation.

AB  - Although long-term proteasome inhibitor therapy improves outcomes in multiple myeloma, many patients cannot tolerate long-term treatment or might require or prefer to continue treatment outside the hospital or clinic. The US MM-6 study is evaluating the in-class transition from parenteral bortezomib- to oral ixazomib-based therapy in routine clinical practice. Preliminary results indicate feasibility, prolonged therapy duration, promising efficacy, and treatment adherence and satisfaction.
   Background: The ongoing US MM-6 study is investigating in-class transition (iCT) from parenteral bortezomib-based induction to all-oral IRd (ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) with the aim of increasing proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based treatment adherence and duration while maintaining patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and improving outcomes. Patients and Methods: US community sites are enrolling nonetransplant-eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) with no evidence of progressive disease after 3 cycles of bortezomib-based therapy to receive IRd ( up to 39 cycles or until progression or toxicity). The patients use mobile or wearable digital devices to collect actigraphy (activity and sleep) data and electronically complete HRQoL, treatment satisfaction and medication adherence questionnaires. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. The key secondary endpoints include response rates and therapy duration. Results: At the data cutoff, 84 patients had been treated (median age 73 years; 44% aged >= 75 years; 49% men; 15% Black or African American; and 10% Hispanic or Latino). Of the 84 patients, 62% were continuing therapy. The mean duration of total PI therapy was 10.1 months and for the IRd regimen was 7.3 months. With an 8-month median follow-up, the 12-month progression-free survival rate was 86% (95% confidence interval, 73%-93%) from both the start of bortezomib-based treatment and the start of IRd. The overall response rate was 62% (complete response, 4%; very good partial response, 25%; partial response, 33%) after bortezomib-based induction and 70% (complete response, 26%; very good partial response, 29%; partial response, 15%) after iCT. The IRd safety profile was consistent with previous clinical trial data, and HRQoL and treatment satisfaction were maintained. Conclusion: The patients included in the US MM-6 study are representative of the real-world US MM population. The use of iCT might permit prolonged PI-based therapy with promising efficacy, without impacting patients' HRQoL or treatment satisfaction. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BackgroundUsing Ambient Assisted Living sensors to detect acute stress could help people mitigate the harmful effects of everyday stressful situations. This would help both the healthy and those affected more by sudden stressors, e.g., people with diabetes or heart conditions. The study aimed to develop a method for providing reliable stress detection based on heart rate variability features extracted from portable devices.MethodsFeatures extracted from portable electrocardiogram sensor recordings were used for training various classification algorithms for stress detection purposes. Data were recorded in a clinical trial with 7 participants and two stressors, the Trier Social Stress Test and the Stroop colour word test, both validated by standardised questionnaires. Different heart rate variability feature sets (all, time-domain and non-linear only, frequency-domain only) were tested to investigate how classification performance is affected, in addition to various time window length setups and participant-wise training sessions. The accuracy and F1 score of the trained models were compared and analysed.ResultsThe best results were achieved with models using time-domain and non-linear heart rate variability features with 5-min-long overlapping time windows, yielding 96.31% accuracy and 96.26% F1 score. Shorter overlapping windows had slightly lower performance, with 91.62-94.55% accuracy and 91.77-94.55% F1 score ranges. Non-overlapping window configurations were less effective, with both accuracy and F1 score below 88%. For participant-wise learning, average F1 scores of 99.47%, 98.93% and 96.1% were achieved for feature sets using all, time-domain and non-linear, and frequency-domain features, respectively.ConclusionThe tested stress detector models based on heart rate variability data recorded by a single electrocardiogram sensor performed just as well as those published in the literature working with multiple sensors, or even better. This suggests that once portable devices such as smartwatches provide reliable hear rate variability recordings, efficient stress detection can be achieved without the need for additional physiological measurements.

AB  - Printable organic sensors fabricated from solution-processed pi-conjugated polymers (pi-CPs) are promising candidates to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) due to the intriguing physical, chemical and electronic properties of pi-CPs. These devices, often termed organic chemiresistors, require good sensing capabilities to transduce stimuli from specific VOCs at low concentrations into analytical electric signals. However, discriminating such VOCs using organic chemiresistors has proven very challenging. Herein, we report that the molecular-level electrochemical doping of pi-CPs with solid-state ionic liquids (SILs) significantly improves their electrical conductivity (similar to 10(-1)S cm(-1)) and selective VOC interactions, which can be manipulated through different pi-CPs:SIL blend ratios. These characteristics enable the fine discrimination of VOCs at concentrations in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range under low power consumption (<0.1 mu W) and room temperature conditions. Our result provides a new opportunity for developing highly sensitive and selective VOC monitoring platform technologies that are printable on large-area, wearable, flexible and transparent substrates.

AB  - Purpose The advantage of prone setup compared with supine for left-breast radiotherapy is controversial. We evaluate the dosimetric gain of prone setup and aim to identify predictors of the gain.
   Methods Left-sided breast cancer patients who had dual computed tomography (CT) planning in prone free breathing (FB) and supine deep inspiration breath-hold (DiBH) were retrospectively identified. Radiation doses to heart, lungs, breasts, and tumor bed were evaluated using the recently developed mean absolute dose deviation (MADD). MADD measures how widely the dose delivered to a structure deviates from a reference dose specified for the structure. A penalty score was computed for every treatment plan as a weighted sum of the MADDs normalized to the breast prescribed dose. Changes in penalty scores when switching from supine to prone were assessed by paired t-tests and by the number of patients with a reduction of the penalty score (i.e., gain). Robust linear regression and fractional polynomials were used to correlate patients' characteristics and their respective penalty scores.
   Results Among 116 patients identified with dual CT planning, the prone setup, compared with supine, was associated with a dosimetric gain in 72 (62.1%, 95% CI: 52.6-70.9%). The most significant predictors of a gain with the prone setup were the breast depth prone/supine ratio (>1.6), breast depth difference (>31 mm), prone breast depth (>77 mm), and breast volume (>282 mL).
   Conclusion Prone compared with supine DiBH was associated with a dosimetric gain in 62.1% of our left-sided breast cancer patients. High pendulousness and moderately large breast predicted for the gain.

AB  - Background: Chronic inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, there is a paucity of information about whether Behcet's disease (BD) is associated with an increased risk of AF. This population-based study aimed to determine the risk of AF in patients with BD.
   Methods: A total of 6636 newly diagnosed BD patients without a history of AF were included from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database between 2010 and 2014. Newly diagnosed non-valvular AF was identified using the claims data. An age-and sex-matched non-BD subjects were extracted at a ratio of 1:5 (n = 31,040). The incidence and risk of AF were compared between groups.
   Results: During a mean follow-up of 3.6 +/- 1.5 years, AF was newly diagnosed in 173 patients (51 in the BD group, 122 in the control group). The incidence was 2.3 and 1.1 per 1000 person-years, respectively. After adjustment, the BD group showed a 1.8-fold higher risk of AF compared to the control group. Patients with BD aged <= 40 years had a higher risk of AF, while patients aged = 65 years showed a similar risk. Men with BD had a 2.5-fold increased risk of AF, whereas women with BD did not. Severe BD had a higher risk for AF compared to non-severe BD and controls.
   Conclusions: BD was associated with an increased risk of AF, particularly in men and young patients. Active surveillance and treatment are needed in BD patients and those with arrhythmic symptoms. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Wearable technology for fall alerts among older adult care recipients is one of the more frequently studied areas of technology, given the concerning consequences of falls among this population. Falls are quite prevalent in later life. While there is a growing amount of literature on older adults' acceptance of technology, less is known about how caregivers' attitudes toward technology can impact care recipients' use of such technology.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to examine associations between caregivers' attitudes toward technology for caregiving and care recipients' use of fall alert wearables.
   Methods: This study examined data collected with an online survey from 626 caregivers for adults 50 years and older. Adapted from the technology acceptance model, a structural equation model tested the following prespecified hypotheses: (1) higher perceived usefulness of technologies for caregiving would predict higher perceived value of and greater interest in technologies for caregiving; (2) higher perceived value of technologies for caregiving would predict greater interest in technologies for caregiving; and (3) greater interest in technologies for caregiving would predict greater use of fall alert wearables among care recipients. Additionally, we included demographic factors (eg, caregivers' and care recipients' ages) and caregiving context (eg, caregiver type and caregiving situation) as important predictors of care recipients' use of fall alert wearables.
   Results: Of 626 total respondents, 548 (87.5%) with all valid responses were included in this study. Among care recipients, 28% used fall alert wearables. The final model had a good to fair model fit: a confirmatory factor index of 0.93, a standardized root mean square residual of 0.049, and root mean square error of approximation of 0.066. Caregivers' perceived usefulness of technology was positively associated with their attitudes toward using technology in caregiving (b=.70, P<.001) and interest in using technology for caregiving (b=.22, P=.003). Greater perceived value of using technology in caregiving predicted greater interest in using technology for caregiving (b=.65, P<.001). Greater interest in using technology for caregiving was associated with greater likelihood of care recipients using fall alert wearables (b=.27, P<.001). The caregiver type had the strongest inverse relationship with care recipients' use of fall alert wearables (unpaid vs paid caregiver) (b=-.33, P<.001).
   Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of caregivers' attitudes in care recipients' technology use for falls management. Raising awareness and improving perception about technologies for caregiving may help caregivers and care recipients adopt and better utilize technologies that can promote independence and enhance safety.

AB  - The analysis of ribonucleic acid (RNA) plays an important role in the early diagnosis of diseases and will greatly benefit patients with a higher cure rate. However, the low abundance of RNA in physiological environments requires ultrahigh sensitivity of a detection technology. Here, we construct a portable and smart-phone-controlled biosensing platform based on disposable organic electrochemical transistors for ultrasensitive analysis of microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers within 1 h. Due to their inherent amplification function, the devices can detect miRNA cancer biomarkers from little-volume solutions with concentrations down to 10(-14) M. The devices can distinguish blood miRNA expression levels at different cancer stages using a 4T1 mouse tumor model. The technique for ultrasensitive and fast detection of RNA biomarkers with high selectivity opens a window for mobile diagnosis of various diseases with low cost.

AB  - In order to develop effective interventions for restoring upper extremity function after cervical spinal cord injury, tools are needed to accurately measure hand function throughout the rehabilitation process. However, there is currently no suitable method to collect information about hand function in the community, when patients are not under direct observation of a clinician. We propose a wearable system that can monitor functional hand use using computer vision techniques applied to egocentric camera videos. To this end, in this study we demonstrate the feasibility of detecting interactions of the hand with objects in the environment from egocentric video. The system consists of a preprocessing step where the hand is segmented out from the background. The algorithm then extracts features associated with hand-object interactions. This includes comparing motion cues in the region near the hand (i.e., where the object is most likely to be located) to the motion of the hand itself, as well as to the motion of the background. Features representing hand shape are also extracted. The features serve as inputs to a random forest classifier, which was tested with a dataset of 14 activities of daily living as well as noninteractive tasks in five environment (total video duration of 44.16 min). The average F-score for the classifier was 0.85 for leave-one-activity out in our dataset set and 0.91 for a publicly available set (1.72 min) when filtered with a moving average. These results suggest that using egocentric video to monitor functional hand use at home is feasible.

AB  - Background Circadian rhythms in body temperature coordinate peripheral molecular clocks, hence they could potentially predict optimal treatment timing (chronotherapy) in individual patients. Circadian parameters in chest surface body temperature (Chesttemp) were recorded remotely and in real time through the use of wearable sensors. Methods The dynamics of circadian oscillations in Chesttemp and core body temperature (Coretemp) and their moderation by sex and age were analysed in 38 men and 50 women, aged 21-78 years. In two studies (ST1 and ST2), Chesttemp was measured every minute and teletransmitted using a BLE-connected sensor for 3.6-28.3 days. Additionally, in ST2, Coretemp was recorded per minute in 33 age- and sex-stratified subjects using electronic ingestible pills with radio-frequency transmissions. Circadian parameters were computed using spectral analysis and cosinor modelling. The temporal relations between Chesttemp and Coretemp cosinor parameters were summarised with principal component (PC) analysis. The effect of sex and age was analysed through multivariate regression. Results Using spectral analysis, a dominant period of 24- or 12-h was identified in 93.2% of the Chesttemp and in 100% of the Coretemp time series. The circadian parameters varied largely between-subjects both for Chesttemp (ranges: mesors, 33.2-36.6 degrees C; amplitudes, 0.2-2.5 degrees C; acrophases, 14:05-7:40), and Coretemp (mesors, 36.6-37.5 degrees C; amplitudes, 0.2-0.7 degrees C; bathyphases, 23:50-6:50). Higher PC loadings mainly corresponded to (i) large Chesttemp amplitudes, and phase advance of both temperature rhythms for the first PC (PC1, 27.2% of variance var.), (ii) high mesors in both temperature rhythms for PC2 (22.4% var.), and (iii) large Coretemp amplitudes for PC3 (12.9% var.). Chesttemp and Coretemp mesors and PC2 loadings decreased in females, while remaining quite stable in males as a function of age. In contrast, Coretemp amplitude and PC3 loadings increased with age in females, but decreased in males. Finally, older subjects, both female and male, displayed a reduction in ultradian variabilities, and an increase in both Chesttemp circadian amplitude and PC1 loadings. Interpretation The dynamics relations between Chesttemp and Coretemp rhythms were largely moderated by age and sex, with results suggesting that treatment timing could be most critical for therapeutic index in women and in order people.

AB  - There is an increased interest in using wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) in clinical contexts for the diagnosis and rehabilitation of gait pathologies. Despite this interest, there is a lack of research regarding optimal sensor placement when measuring joint kinematics and few studies which examine functionally relevant motions other than straight level walking. The goal of this clinical measurement research study was to investigate how the location of IMU sensors on the lower body impact the accuracy of IMU-based hip, knee, and ankle angular kinematics. IMUs were placed on 11 different locations on the body to measure lower limb joint angles in seven participants performing the timed-up-and-go (TUG) test. Angles were determined using different combinations of IMUs and the TUG was segmented into different functional movements. Mean bias and root mean square error values were computed using generalized estimating equations comparing IMU-derived angles to a reference optical motion capture system. Bias and RMSE values vary with the sensor position. This effect is partially dependent on the functional movement analyzed and the joint angle measured. However, certain combinations of sensors produce lower bias and RMSE more often than others. The data presented here can inform clinicians and researchers of placement of IMUs on the body that will produce lower error when measuring joint kinematics for multiple functionally relevant motions. Optimization of IMU-based kinematic measurements is important because of increased interest in the use of IMUs to inform diagnose and rehabilitation in clinical settings and at home.

AB  - Non-specific sympathetic arousal responses to different stressful elicitations can be easily recognized from the analysis of physiological signals. However, neural patterns of sympathetic arousal during physical and mental fatigue are clearly not unitary. In the context of physiological monitoring through wearable and non-invasive devices, electrodermal activity (EDA) is the most effective and widely used marker of sympathetic activation. This study presents ComEDA, a novel approach for the characterization of complex dynamics of EDA. ComEDA overcomes the methodological limitations related to the application of nonlinear analysis to EDA dynamics, is not parameter-sensitive and is suitable for the analysis of ultra-short time series. We validated the proposed algorithm using synthetic series of white noise and 1/f noise, varying the number of samples from 50 to 5000. By applying our approach, we were able to discriminate a statistically significant increase of complexity in the 1/f noise with respect to white noise, obtaining p-values in the range [4.35 x 10(-6), 0.03] after the Mann-Whitney test. Then, we tested ComEDA on both EDA signal and its tonic and phasic components, acquired from healthy subjects during four experimental protocols: two inducing a sympathetic activation through physical efforts and two based on mentally stressful tasks. Results are encouraging and promising, outperforming state of the art metrics such as the Sample Entropy. ComEDA shows good performance not only in discriminating between stressful tasks and resting state (p-value < 0.01 after the Wilcoxon non-parametric statistical test applied to EDA signals of all the four datasets), but also in differentiating different trends of complexity of EDA dynamics when induced by physical and mental stressors. These findings suggest future applications to automatically detect and selectively identify threats due to overwhelming stress impacting both physical and mental health or in the field of telemedicine to monitor autonomic diseases correlated to atypical sympathetic activation. The Matlab code implementing the ComEDA algorithm is available online.

AB  - A finger held in the air exhibits microvibrations, which are reduced when it touches a static object. When a finger moves along a surface, the friction between them produces vibrations, which can not be produced with a free-moving finger in the air. With an inertial measurement unit (IMU) capturing such motion characteristics, we demonstrate the feasibility to detect contact between the finger and static objects. We call our technique ActualTouch. Studies show that a single nail-mounted IMU on the index finger provides sufficient data to train a binary touch status classifier (i.e., touch vs. no-touch), with an accuracy above 95%, generalised across users. This model, trained on a rigid tabletop surface, was found to retain an average accuracy of 96% for 7 other types of everyday surfaces with varying rigidity, and in walking and sitting scenarios where no touch occurred. ActualTouch can be combined with other interaction techniques, such as in a uni-stroke gesture recogniser on arbitrary surfaces, where touch status from ActualTouch is used to delimit the motion gesture data that feed into the recogniser. We demonstrate the potential of ActualTouch in a range of scenarios, such as interaction for augmented reality applications, and leveraging daily surfaces and objects for ad-hoc interactions.

AB  - Adhesives that involve adhesion to the skin have been of great technological importance in medical or pharmaceutical fields, including recently emerging wearable sensors and electronics. The objective of this work was to evaluate the performances of silicone-based adhesives with skin, using a peel adhesion test. Specifically, we explored the effect of adhesive cleansing, which is an inevitable daily event for patients' comfort in long-term applications. Firstly, three medical grade silicone gels, Silbione (R) RT 4717, Silbione (R) RT 4642, and Silpuran (R) 2130, were used to fabricate adhesive pads. Their peel strength values were subsequently measured and compared, among which Silbione (R) RT gel 4717 possessed the highest peel strength. Therefore, it was selected as the raw material to fabricate the pads with a thickness range of 640-740 mu m. Secondly, the peel adhesion of Silbione (R) RT 4717 adhesive pad was further compared with a series of commercial products that employ various medical-grade adhesives. The peel strength results indicated that our custom-made adhesive pad had an adequately strong adhesion for clinical use. Thirdly, in order to observe and predict the long-term performance of the adhesives, an aging test was performed in an ambient environment, revealing that Silbione (R) RT 4717 adhesive remained highly sticky for 5 days. Lastly, adequate cleansing protocols were established by monitoring the changes in peel strength after washing and wiping events. The reusability analysis showed that Silbione (R) 4717 adhesive pad was reusable in a one-week period for the washing method

AB  - Background: Epileptic seizures are spontaneous events that severely affect the lives of patients due to their recurrence and unpredictability. The integration of new wearable and mobile technologies to collect electroencephalographic (EEG) and extracerebral signals in a portable system might be the solution to prospectively identify times of seizure occurrence or propensity. The performances of several seizure detection devices have been assessed by validated studies, and patient perspectives on wearables have been explored to better match their needs. Despite this, there is a major gap in the literature on long-term, real-life acceptability and performance of mobile technology essential to managing chronic disorders such as epilepsy.
   Objective: EEG@HOME is an observational, nonrandomized, noninterventional study that aims to develop a new feasible procedure that allows people with epilepsy to independently, continuously, and safely acquire noninvasive variables at home. The data collected will be analyzed to develop a general model to predict periods of increased seizure risk.
   Methods: A total of 12 adults with a diagnosis of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy and at least 20 seizures per year will be recruited at King's College Hospital, London. Participants will be asked to self-apply an easy and portable EEG recording system (ANT Neuro) to record scalp EEG at home twice daily. From each serial EEG recording, brain network ictogenicity (BNI), a new biomarker of the propensity of the brain to develop seizures, will be extracted. A noninvasive wrist-worn device (Fitbit Charge 3; Fitbit Inc) will be used to collect non-EEG biosignals (heart rate, sleep quality index, and steps), and a smartphone app (Seer app; Seer Medical) will be used to collect data related to seizure occurrence, medication taken, sleep quality, stress, and mood. All data will be collected continuously for 6 months. Standardized questionnaires (the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire and System Usability Scale) will be completed to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the procedure. BNI, continuous wrist-worn sensor biosignals, and electronic survey data will be correlated with seizure occurrence as reported in the diary to investigate their potential values as biomarkers of seizure risk.
   Results: The EEG@HOME project received funding from Epilepsy Research UK in 2018 and was approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee in March 2020. The first participants were enrolled in October 2020, and we expect to publish the first results by the end of 2022.
   Conclusions: With the EEG@HOME study, we aim to take advantage of new advances in remote monitoring technology, including self-applied EEG, to investigate the feasibility of long-term disease self-monitoring. Further, we hope our study will bring new insights into noninvasively collected personalized risk factors of seizure occurrence and seizure propensity that may help to mitigate one of the most difficult aspects of refractory epilepsy: the unpredictability of seizure occurrence.

AB  - Research of human hand movements recognition can be applied to artificial limb control, motion recognition of wearable exoskeleton, human-computer interaction in virtual reality and so on. Surface Electromyogram (sEMG) signal is the preferred source. There are many researches on how to extract information from sEMG signal and apply it to human motion recognition. However, how to extract the feature signal from sEMG signal is a difficult problem in the research of human hand movement recognition based on sEMG signal. In this paper, a method based on Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and composite permutation entropy index (CPEI) method is proposed for hand motion classification. Previously, the VMD method had not been used in human hand motion recognition studies. The method proposed in this work applies the VMD method to decompose the original sEMG signal into multiple Variational Mode Functions (VMFs) and calculate the corresponding CPEI of each signal component. Three feature selection methods (Infinite Latent Feature Selection (ILFS), ReliefF, and Laplacian Score) were applied to rank the features and remove the unimportant features. Three classifiers (Naive Bayes, K-NN, and Bagging) were used to recognize the hand actions. Ten volunteers participated in the experiment, and the experimental data were used to verify the proposed method. The average accuracy was 94.28 +/- 1.26% for the proposed method with Laplacian Score for feature sorting and selection, and Bagging as classifier.

AB  - Biomolecule-based piezoelectric nanostructures emerged as a new class of energy-converse materials, and designing tailored piezoelectric amino acid arrays is essential to achieve efficient electrical-mechanical coupling and fulfill their application potential. However, the controlled growth of amino acid nanostructures is still challenging due to the limited understanding of their growth mechanism. Herein, we base on the Stranski-Krastanov (S-K) growth mode and propose a mechanism for the growth of ordered amino acid array structures via physical vapor deposition. The growth of vertical valine sheet arrays is examined by changing the substrate temperature, chamber pressure, and source-substrate distance, and a "layer-plus-sheet" growth process is revealed. The modified S-K growth mode is applied to fabricate other amino acid nanostructures like leucine and isoleucine. The growth mode not only explains the formation of uniform and controllable morphology of amino acid structures but also leads to the significant enhancement of their piezoelectric properties. The maximal effective piezoelectric constant of valine sheets is 11.4 pm V-1, which approaches its highest predicted value. The output voltage of the valine array-based nanogenerator is similar to 4.6 times the output voltage of the valine powder-based nanogenerator. This work provides new insights into the growth mechanism of ordered piezoelectric amino acid arrays, making them promising candidates for applications in wearable or implantable electronic devices.

AB  - Gastric emptying rate (GER) signifies the rate at which the stomach empties following ingestion of a meal and is relevant to a wide range of clinical conditions. GER also represents a rate limiting step in small intestinal absorption and so is widely assessed for research purposes. Despite the clinical and physiological importance of gastric emptying, methods used to measure GER possess a series of limitations (including being invasive, slow or unsuitable for certain patient populations). Here, we present a new technique based on transcutaneous (through-the-skin) fluorescence spectroscopy that is fast, non-invasive, and does not require the collection of samples or laboratory-based analysis. Thus, this approach has the potential to allow immediate reporting of clinical results. Using this new method, participants receive an oral dose of a fluorescent contrast agent and a wearable probe detects the uptake of the agent from the gut into the blood stream. Analysis of the resulting data then permits the calculation of GER. We compared our spectroscopic technique to the paracetamol absorption test (a clinically approved GER test) in a clinical study of 20 participants. Results demonstrated good agreement between the two approaches and, hence, the clear potential of transcutaneous fluorescence spectroscopy for clinical assessment of GER.

AB  - The standard method for determining diesel particulate matter (DPM) exposures in underground metal/nonmetal mines provides the average exposure concentration for an entire working shift, and several weeks might pass before results are obtained. The main problem with this approach is that it only indicates that an overexposure has occurred rather than providing the ability to prevent an overexposure or detect its cause. Conversely, real-time measurement would provide miners with timely information to allow engineering controls to be deployed immediately and to identify the major factors contributing to any overexposures. Toward this purpose, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a laser extinction method to measure real-time elemental carbon (EC) concentrations (EC is a DPM surrogate). To employ this method, NIOSH developed a person-wearable instrument that was commercialized in 2011. This paper evaluates this commercial instrument, including the calibration curve, limit of detection, accuracy, and potential interferences. The instrument was found to meet the NIOSH accuracy criteria and to be capable of measuring DPM concentrations at levels observed in underground mines. In addition, it was found that a submicron size selector was necessary to avoid interference from mine dust and that cigarette smoke can be an interference when sampling in enclosed cabs.

TI  - The RITMIA (TM) Smartphone App for Automated Detection of Atrial Fibrillation: Accuracy in Consecutive Patients Undergoing Elective Electrical Cardioversion
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
KW  - PREVALENCE
KW  - STROKE
AB  - Background. The RITMIA (TM) app (Heart Sentinel (TM), Parma, Italy) is a novel application that combined with a wearable consumer-grade chest-strap Bluetooth heart rate monitor, provides automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), and may be promising for sustainable AF screening programs, since it is known that prolonged monitoring leads to increased AF diagnosis. Objective. The purpose of this study was to examine whether RITMIA (TM) could accurately differentiate sinus rhythm (SR) from AF compared with gold-standard physician-interpreted 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Design. In this observational prospective study consecutive patients presenting for elective cardioversion (ECV) of AF, from November 2017 to November 2018, were enrolled. Patients underwent paired 12-lead ECG and RITMIA (TM) recording, both before and after ECV procedure. The RITMIA (TM) automated interpretation was compared with 12-lead ECG interpreted by the agreement of two cardiologists. The latter were blinded to the results of the App automated diagnosis. Feasibility, sensitivity, specificity, and K coefficient for RITMIA (TM) automated diagnosis were calculated. Results. A total of 100 consecutive patients were screened and enrolled. Five patients did not undergo ECV due to spontaneous restoration of SR. 95 patients who actually underwent ECV were included in the final analysis. Mean age was 66.2 +/- 10.7 years; female patients were 20 (21.1%). There were 190 paired ECGs and RITMIA (TM) recordings. The RITMIA (TM) app correctly detected AF with 97% sensitivity, 95.6% specificity, and a K coefficient of 0.93. Conclusions. The automated RITMIA (TM) algorithm very accurately differentiated AF from SR before and after elective ECV. The only hardware required by this method is a cheap consumer-grade Bluetooth heart rate monitor of the chest-strap type. This robust and affordable RITMIA (TM) technology could be used to conduct population-wide screening in patients at risk for silent AF, thanks to the long-term monitoring applicability.

AB  - Background Mobile dietary self-monitoring methods allow for objective assessment of adherence to self-monitoring; however, the best way to define self-monitoring adherence is not known.
   Objective The objective was to identify the best criteria for defining adherence to dietary self-monitoring with mobile devices when predicting weight loss.
   Design This was a secondary data analysis from two 6-month randomized trials: Dietary Intervention to Enhance Tracking with Mobile Devices (n=42 calorie tracking app or n=39 wearable Bite Counter device) and Self-Monitoring Assessment in Real Time (n=20 kcal tracking app or n=23 photo meal app).
   Participants/setting Adults (n=124; mean body mass index=34.7 +/- 5.6) participated in one of two remotely delivered weight-loss interventions at a southeastern university between 2015 and 2017.
   Intervention All participants received the same behavioral weight loss information via twice-weekly podcasts. Participants were randomly assigned to a specific diet tracking method.
   Main outcome measures Seven methods of tracking adherence to self-monitoring (eg, number of days tracked, and number of eating occasions tracked) were examined, as was weight loss at 6 months.
   Statistical analyses performed Linear regression models estimated the strength of association (R-2) between each method of tracking adherence and weight loss, adjusting for age and sex.
   Results Among all study completers combined (N=91), adherence defined as the overall number of days participants tracked at least two eating occasions explained the most variance in weight loss at 6 months (R-2=0.27; P<0.001). Self-monitoring declined over time; all examined adherence methods had fewer than half the sample still tracking after Week 10.
   Conclusions Using the total number of days at least two eating occasions are tracked using a mobile self-monitoring method may be the best way to assess self-monitoring adherence during weight loss interventions. This study shows that self-monitoring rates decline quickly and elucidates potential times for early interventions to stop the reductions in self-monitoring.

AB  - Walking is for humans an essential task in our daily life. However, there is a huge (and growing) number of people who have this ability diminished or are not able to walk due to motor disabilities. In this paper, a system to detect the start and the stop of the gait through electroencephalographic signals has been developed. The system has been designed in order to be applied in the future to control a lower limb exoskeleton to help stroke or spinal cord injured patients during the gait. The brain-machine interface (BMI) training has been optimized through a preliminary analysis using the brain information recorded during the experiments performed by three healthy subjects. Afterward, the system has been verified by other four healthy subjects and three patients in a real-time test. In both preliminary optimization analysis and real-time tests, the results obtained are very similar. The true positive rates are 54.8% and 56.1% respectively. Regarding the false positive per minute, the values are also very similar, decreasing from 2.66 in preliminary tests to 1.90 in real-time. Finally, the average latencies in the detection of the movement intentions are 794 and 798 ms, preliminary and real-time tests respectively.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation is the most common recurrent arrhythmia in clinical practice, with most clinical events occurring outside the hospital. Low detection and nonadherence to guidelines are the primary obstacles to atrial fibrillation management. Photoplethysmography is a novel technology developed for atrial fibrillation screening. However, there has been limited validation of photoplethysmography-based smart devices for the detection of atrial fibrillation and its underlying clinical factors impacting detection.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore the feasibility of photoplethysmography-based smart devices for the detection of atrial fibrillation in real-world settings.
   Methods: Subjects aged >= 18 years (n=361) were recruited from September 14 to October 16, 2018, for screening of atrial fibrillation with active measurement, initiated by the users, using photoplethysmography-based smart wearable devices (ie, a smart band or smart watches). Of these, 200 subjects were also automatically and periodically monitored for 14 days with a smart band. The baseline diagnosis of "suspected" atrial fibrillation was confirmed by electrocardiogram and physical examination The sensitivity and accuracy of photoplethysmography-based smart devices for monitoring atrial fibrillation were evaluated.
   Results: A total of 2353 active measurement signals and 23,864 periodic measurement signals were recorded. Eleven subjects were confirmed to have persistent atrial fibrillation, and 20 were confirmed to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Smart devices demonstrated >91% predictive ability for atrial fibrillation. The sensitivity and specificity of devices in detecting atrial fibrillation among active recording of the 361 subjects were 100% and about 99%, respectively. For subjects with persistent atrial fibrillation, 127 (97.0%) active measurements and 2240 (99.2%) periodic measurements were identified as atrial fibrillation by the algorithm. For subjects with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, 36 (17%) active measurements and 717 (19.8%) periodic measurements were identified as atrial fibrillation by the algorithm. All persistent atrial fibrillation cases could be detected as "atrial fibrillation episodes" by the photoplethysmography algorithm on the first monitoring day, while 14 (70%) patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation demonstrated "atrial fibrillation episodes" within the first 6 days. The average time to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was 2 days (interquartile range: 1.25-5.75) by active measurement and 1 day (interquartile range: 1.00-2.00) by periodic measurement (P=.10). The first detection time of atrial fibrillation burden of <50% per 24 hours was 4 days by active measurement and 2 days by periodic measurementThe first detection time of atrial fibrillation burden of >50% per 24 hours was 1 day for both active and periodic measurements (active measurement: P=.02, periodic measurement: P=.03).
   Conclusions: Photoplethysmography-based smart devices demonstrated good atrial fibrillation predictive ability in both active and periodic measurements. However, atrial fibrillation type could impact detection, resulting in increased monitoring time.

AB  - Background: Clinical rating of bradykinesia in Parkinson disease (PD) is challenging as it must combine several movement features into a single score. Additionally, in-clinic assessment cannot capture fluctuations throughout the day.
   Objective: To evaluate the reliability and responsiveness of a motion sensor-based tablet app for objective bradykinesia assessment in clinic and at home as compared to clinical ratings.
   Methods: Thirty-two PD patients treated with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) were outfitted with a motion sensor on the index finger of the more affected hand to perform two repetitions of finger-tapping, hand opening-closing, and arm pronation-supination tasks with DBS on and 10, 20, and 30 minutes after turning DBS off. Tasks were videotaped for blinded clinician rating using the Modified Bradykinesia Rating Scale (MBRS). Participants were then sent home with an app-based system to perform two repetitions of the same tasks six times per day spaced two hours apart, three days per week, for two weeks. Intraclass correlation (ICC) and minimal detectable change (MDC) were calculated.
   Results: As the effects of DBS wore off, motion sensors detected worsening of amplitude sooner than did clinician-rated MBRS for all three tasks. ICCs were significantly higher and MDCs were significantly lower for motion sensors in the clinic and at home than for clinician ratings (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: The tablet-based app demonstrated higher reliability and responsiveness in capturing bradykinesia-related tasks in the clinic and at home than did clinician ratings. This tool may enhance the assessment of novel therapies.

AB  - Background: Obesity is a well-known risk factor for development of atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the impact of underweight on AF has not been previously recognized. We sought to determine the risk of AF in subjects with underweight in this study.
   Methods: We analyzed clinical data from a total of 132,063 individuals with the age of 40 years or older who received health care checkups arranged by the national insurance program between 2003 and 2004. Newly diagnosed nonvalvular AF was identified using claim data during a median follow-up duration of 9.0 years.
   Results: The mean body mass index (BMI) of patients was 23.9 kg/m(2), and 3,323 individuals (2.5%) were classified as being underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m(2)). During the study period, 3,237 individuals (2.5%) developed AF. There was a U-shaped relationship between BMI and AF occurrence: Each 1.0 kg/m(2) increase of BMI above 20 kg/m(2) was associated with a 6% increased risk of AF (p < 0.001), while each 1.0 kg/m(2) lower BMI below 20 kg/m(2) was associated with a 13% increased risk of AF (p < 0.001) after multivariable adjustment. Underweight was significantly associated with 23% increased risk of AF, while obesity classes I and II were with 26% and 120% increased risk of AF, respectively. Excess risk of AF in the underweight was independent of thyroid disease, chronic lung disease, or history of malignancy, and was not attributable to cigarette smoking, low socioeconomic status, excessive physical activity, or heavy alcohol consumption.
   Conclusion: BMI has a U-shaped relationship with the risk of AF. Underweight was an independent risk factor for AF independent of confounding factors such as chronic lung disease and malignancy. These findings suggest that underweight is associated with biological effects that contribute to the development of AF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We present a 3D deep neural network known as URDNet for detecting ground-glass opacity (GGO) nodules in 3D CT images. Prior work on GGO detection repurposes classifiers on a large number of windows to perform detection or fine-tuning by box regression based on a previous window classification step. Instead, we consider GGO detection as a multitarget regression problem to focus on the location of GGO. Furthermore, to capture multiscale information, we introduce a backbone network which is a contracting-expanding structure similar to 2D U-net, but we inject the source CT inputs into each layer in the contracting pathway to prevent source information loss at different scales. At last, we propose a two-stage training method for URDNet. In the first stage, the backbone of the network for feature extraction is trained, and in the second, the overall URDNet is fine-tuned based on the previous pretrained weights. By using this training method in conjunction with data augmentation and hard negative mining techniques, our URDNet can be effectively trained even on a small amount of annotated CT images. We evaluate the proposed method on the LIDC-IDRI dataset. It achieves the sensitivity of 90.8% with only 1 false positive per scan. Experimental results show that our detection method achieves the superior detection performance over the state-of-the-art methods. Due to its simplicity and effective, URDNet can be easier to apply to medical IoT systems for improving the efficiency of overall health systems.

TI  - Sustainable polyethylene fabrics with engineered moisture transport for passive cooling

LA  - English
AB  - Polyethylene (PE) has emerged recently as a promising polymer for incorporation in wearable textiles owing to its high infrared transparency and tuneable visible opacity, which allows the human body to cool via thermal radiation, potentially saving energy on building refrigeration. Here, we show that single-material PE fabrics may offer a sustainable, high-performance alternative to conventional textiles, extending beyond radiative cooling. PE fabrics exhibit ultra-light weight, low material cost and recyclability. Industrial materials sustainability (Higg) index calculations predict a low environmental footprint for PE fabrics in the production phase. We engineered PE fibres, yarns and fabrics to achieve efficient water wicking and fast-drying performance which, combined with their excellent stain resistance, offer promise in reducing energy and water consumption as well as the environmental footprint of PE textiles in their use phase. Unlike previously explored nanoporous PE materials, the high-performance PE fabrics in this study are made from fibres melt spun and woven on standard equipment used by the textile industry worldwide and do not require any chemical coatings. We further demonstrate that these PE fibres can be dry coloured during fabrication, resulting in dramatic water savings without masking the PE molecular fingerprints scanned during the automated recycling process.
   The textile industry is one of the largest polluters. Here the authors show that polyethylene is a sustainable alternative textile with water wicking and fast-drying performance. The fabrication of polyethylene fabrics is compatible with standard equipment and could be dry-coloured, further reducing water consumption.

AB  - The development of power generators that can function in harsh snowy environments and in contact with snow can be beneficial but challenging to accomplish. Herein, we introduce the first snow-based triboelectric nano-generator (snow-TENG) that can be used as an energy harvester and a multifunctional sensor based on the principle of snow-triboelectrification. In this work, we used a 3D printing technique for the precise design and deposition of the electrode and triboelectric layer, leading to flexible, stretchable and metal-free triboelectric generators. Based on the single electrode mode, the device can generate an instantaneous output power density as high as 0.2 mW/m(2), an open circuit voltage up to 8 V, and a current density of 40 mu A/m(2). In addition, the snow-TENG can function as a miniaturized weather station to monitor the weather in real time to provide accurate information about the snowfall rate, snow accumulation depth, wind direction, and speed in snowy and/or icy environments. In addition, the snow-TENG can be used as a wearable power source and biomechanical sensor to detect human body motions, which may prove useful for snow-related sports. Unlike conventional sensor platforms, our design works without the need for batteries or image processing systems. We envision these devices could potentially be integrated into solar panels to ensure continuous power supply during snowy weather conditions.

AB  - Lead(II) acetate [Pb(Ac)(2)] reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form colored brownish precipitates of lead sulfide. Thus far, in order to detect leakage of H2S gas in industrial sectors, Pb(Ac)(2) has been used as an indicator in the form of test papers with a detection limit only as low as 5 ppm. Diagnosis of halitosis by exhaled breath needs sensors able to detect down to 1 ppm of H2S gas. In this work, high surface area and porous Pb(Ac)(2) anchored nanofibers (NFs) that overcome limitations of the conventional Pb(Ac)(2)-based H2S sensor are successfully achieved. First, lead(II) acetate, which melts at 75 degrees C, and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) polymer are mixed and stirred in dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent at 85 degrees C, enabling uniform dispersion of fine liquid droplets in the electrospinning solution. During the subsequent electrospinning, Pb(Ac)(2) anchored NFs are obtained, providing an ideal nanostructure with high thermal stability against particle aggregation, numerous reactions sites, and enhanced diffusion of H2S into the three-dimensional (3D)-networked NF web. This newly obtained sensing material can detect down to 400 ppb of H2S at a relative humidity of 90%, exhibiting high potential feasibility as a high-performance colorimetric sensor platform for diagnosis of halitosis.

AB  - Background:Walking ability recently emerged as a sub-clinical marker of cognitive decline. Hence, the relationship between baseline gait and future cognitive decline was examined in geriatric patients. Because a loss of complexity (LOC) is a key phenomenon of the aging process that exhibits in multiple systems, we propose the idea that age- and cognition-related LOC may also become manifested in gait function. The LOC theory suggests that even healthy aging is associated with a (neuro)physiological breakdown of system elements that causes a decline in variability and an overall LOC. We used coordination dynamics as a conceptual framework and hypothesized that a LOC is reflected in dynamic gait outcomes (e.g. gait regularity, complexity, stability) and that such outcomes could increase the specificity of the gait-cognition link.Methods:19 geriatric patients (age 80.05.8) were followed for 14.46.6 months. An iPod collected three-dimensional (3D) trunk accelerations while patients walked for 3 minutes. Cognition was evaluated with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Seven-Minute screen (7MS) test. The Reliable Change Index (RCI) quantified the magnitude of cognitive change. Spearman's Rho coefficients () indexed correlations between baseline gait and future cognitive change.Results:Seven patients showed reliable cognitive decline (Cognitive Decline group), and 12 patients remained cognitively stable (Cognitive Stable group) over time. Future cognitive decline was correlated with a more regular ( = 0.579*) and predictable ( = 0.486*) gait pattern, but not with gait speed.Conclusions:The increase in gait regularity and predictability possibly reflects a LOC due to age- and cognition-related (neuro)physiological decline. Because dynamic versus traditional gait outcomes (i.e. gait speed and (variability of) stride time) were more strongly correlated with future cognitive decline, the use of wearable sensors in predicting and monitoring cognitive and physical health in vulnerable geriatric patients can be considered promising. However, our results are preliminary and do require replication in larger cohorts.

AB  - This perspective article will discuss the potential role of body-worn movement monitors for balance and gait assessment and treatment in rehabilitation. Recent advances in inexpensive, wireless sensor technology and smart devices are resulting in an explosion of miniature, portable sensors that can quickly and accurately quantify body motion. Practical and useful movement monitoring systems are now becoming available. It is critical that therapists understand the potential advantages and limitations of such emerging technology. One important advantage of obtaining objective measures of balance and gait from body-worn sensors is impairment-level metrics characterizing how and why functional performance of balance and gait activities are impaired. Therapy can then be focused on the specific physiological reasons for difficulty in walking or balancing during specific tasks. A second advantage of using technology to measure balance and gait behavior is the increased sensitivity of the balance and gait measures to document mild disability and change with rehabilitation. A third advantage of measuring movement, such as postural sway and gait characteristics, with body-worn sensors is the opportunity for immediate biofeedback provided to patients that can focus attention and enhance performance. In the future, body-worn sensors may allow therapists to perform telerehabilitation to monitor compliance with home exercise programs and the quality of their natural mobility in the community. Therapists need technological systems that are quick to use and provide actionable information and useful reports for their patients and referring physicians. Therapists should look for systems that provide measures that have been validated with respect to gold standard accuracy and to clinically relevant outcomes such as fall risk and severity of disability.

AB  - Background The Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) proposed the concept of locomotive syndrome (LS) in 2007 for detecting high-risk individuals with mobility limitation. In 2020, the JOA revised the clinical decision limits and introduced LS stage 3, which carried the highest-risk for LS compared to the conventional stages, 1 and 2. The purpose of this study was to characterize the prevalence, comorbidities, and physical characteristics in each LS stage, as per the LS criteria 2020. Methods We analyzed 2077 participants (64.9% women; mean age, 68.3 +/- 5.4 years) from the Nagahama Study aged >= 60 years. Participants were classified into 4 groups, non-LS and LS stages 1, 2, and 3, based on a 25-question Geriatric Locomotive Function Scale. The prevalence of comorbidities (sarcopenia, osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, low back pain [LBP], and knee pain) were investigated. Physical characteristics were measured based on the physical performance tests including gait speed, five-times chair-stand, single-leg stand, and short physical performance battery; muscle strength tests including grip, knee extension, hip flexion, and abduction; and body-composition analysis including muscle quantity and quality. Differences in the prevalence of comorbidities between LS stages were tested using the chi-square test. The general linear model was performed for univariate and multivariate analyses with post-hoc test to compare the differences in physical characteristics among the LS stages. Results The prevalence of LS increased with age, and the mean prevalence of LS stages 1, 2, and 3 were 24.4, 5.5, and 6.5%, respectively. The prevalence of comorbidities, including sarcopenia, osteoporosis, LBP, and knee pain, increased with worsening LS stage. Physical performance tests were significantly different between LS stages 2 and 3; and muscle strength differed significantly between LS stages 1 and 2. Additionally, in terms of body composition analysis, muscle quality but not muscle quantity showed significant differences among all the LS stages. Conclusions Our findings suggest that muscle strengthening and dynamic training, including balance training in LS stage 1 and 2, respectively, were needed for preventing the LS progression.

AB  - Under physiological conditions biomarker concentrations tend to rise and fall over time e.g. for inflammation. Ex vivo measurements provide a snapshot in time of biomarker concentrations, which is useful, but limited. Approaching real time monitoring of biomarker concentration(s) using a wearable, implantable or injectable in vivo sensor is therefore an appealing target. As an early step towards developing an in vivo biomarker sensor, antibody (AB) tagged magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are used here to demonstrate the in vitro measurement of similar to 5 distinct biomarkers with high specificity and sensitivity. In previous work, aptamers were used to target a given biomarker in vitro and generate magnetic clusters that exhibit a characteristic rotational signature quite different from free NPs. Here the method is expanded to detect a much wider range of biomarkers using polyclonal ABs attached to the surface of the NPs. Commercial ABs exist for a wide range of targets allowing accurate and specific concentration measurements for most significant biomarkers. We show sufficient detection sensitivity, using an in-house spectrometer to measure the rotational signatures of the NPs, to assess physiological concentrations of hormones, cytokines and other signaling molecules. Detection limits for biomarkers drawn mainly from pain and inflammation targets were: 10 pM for mouse Granzyme B (mGZM-B), 40 pM for mouse interferon-gamma (mIFN-gamma), 7 pM for mouse interleukin-6 (mIL-6), 40 pM for rat interleukin-6 (rIL-6), 40 pM for mouse vascular endothelial growth factor (mVEGF) and 250 pM for rat calcitonin gene related peptide (rCGRP). Much lower detection limits are certainly possible using improved spectrometers and nanoparticles.

AB  - A flexible sensor is presented for electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid in sweat based on single-step modified gold microelectrodes. The modification consists of electrodeposition of alginate membrane with trapped CuO nanoparticles. The electrodes are fabricated at a thin polyimide support and the soft nature of the membrane can withstand mechanical stress beyond requirements for skin monitoring. After characterization of the membrane via optical and scanning electron microscopy and cyclic voltammetry, the oxidative properties of CuO are exploited toward ascorbic acid for amperometric measurement at micromolar levels in neutral buffer and acidic artificial sweat, at ultralow applied potential (- 5 mV vs. Au pseudo-reference electrode). Alternatively, measurement of the horizontal shift of redox peaks by cyclic voltammetry is also possible. Obtaining a limit of detection of 1.97 mu M, sensitivity of 0.103 V log (mu M)(-1) of peak shift, and linear range of 10-150 mu M, the effect of possible interfering species present in sweat is minimized, with no observable cross-reaction, thus maintaining a high degree of selectivity despite the absence of enzymes in the fabrication scheme. With a lateral flow approach for sample delivery, repeated measurements show recovery in few seconds, with relative standard deviation of about 20%, which can serve to detect increased loss or absence of vitamin, and yet be improved in future by optimized device designs. This sensor is envisioned as a promising component of wearable devices for e.g. non-invasive monitoring of micronutrient loss through sweat, comprising features of light weight, low cost, and easy fabrication needed for such application.

AB  - Quantitative Doppler ultrasound of the carotid artery has been proposed as an instantaneous surrogate for monitoring rapid changes in left ventricular output. Tracking immediate changes in the arterial Doppler spectrogram has value in acute care settings such as the emergency department, operating room and critical care units. We report a novel, hands-free, continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound patch that adheres to the neck and tracks Doppler blood flow metrics in the common carotid artery using an automated algorithm. String and blood-mimicking test objects demonstrated that changes in velocity were accurately measured using both manually and automatically traced Doppler velocity waveforms. In a small usability study with 22 volunteer users (17 clinical, 5 lay), all users were able to locate the carotid Doppler signal on a volunteer subject, and, in a subsequent survey, agreed that the device was easy to use. To illustrate potential clinical applications of the device, the Doppler ultrasound patch was used on a healthy volunteer undergoing a passive leg raise (PLR) as well as on a congestive heart failure patient at resting baseline. The wearable carotid Doppler patch holds promise because of its ease-of-use, velocity measurement accuracy, and ability to continuously record Doppler spectrograms over many cardiac and respiratory cycles.

AB  - Study design: This is an analytical descriptive study.
   Objectives: The main goal of this study was to compare the modular organization of bilateral lower limb control in incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) patients during overground walking, using muscle synergies analysis. The secondary goal was to determine whether the similarity between the patients and control group correlate with clinical indicators of walking performance.
   Setting: This study was conducted in National Hospital for Spinal Cord Injury (Toledo, Spain).
   Methods: Eight iSCI patients and eight healthy subjects completed 10 walking trials at matched speed. For each trial, three-dimensional motion analysis and surface electromyography (sEMG) analysis of seven leg muscles from both limbs were performed. Muscle synergies were extracted from sEMG signals using a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. The optimal number of synergies has been defined as the minimum number needed to obtain variability accounted for (VAF) >= 90%.
   Results: When compared with healthy references, iSCI patients showed fewer muscle synergies in the most affected side and, in both sides, significant differences in the composition of synergy 2. The degree of similarity of these variables with the healthy reference, together with the composition of synergy 3 of the most affected side, presented significant correlations (P<0.05) with walking performance.
   Conclusion: The analysis of muscle synergies shows potential to detect differences between the two sides in patients with iSCI. Specifically, the VAF may constitute a new neurophysiological metric to assess and monitor patients' condition throughout the gait recovery process.

AB  - In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, adaptive solutions are needed to allow us to make fast decisions and take effective sanitation measures, e.g., the fast screening of large groups (employees, passengers, pupils, etc.). Although being reliable, most of the existing SARS-CoV-2 detection methods cannot be integrated into garments to be used on demand. Here, we report an organic field-effect transistor (OFET)-based biosensing device detecting of both SARS-CoV-2 antigens and anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in less than 20 min. The biosensor was produced by functionalizing an intrinsically stretchable and semiconducting triblock copolymer (TBC) film either with the anti-S1 protein antibodies (S1 Abs) or receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 protein, targeting CoV-2-specific RBDs and anti-S1 Abs, respectively. The obtained sensing platform is easy to realize due to the straightforward fabrication of the TBC film and the utilization of the reliable physical adsorption technique for the molecular immobilization. The device demonstrates a high sensitivity of about 19%/dec and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.36 fg/mL for anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies and, at the same time, a sensitivity of 32%/dec and a LOD of 76.61 pg/mL for the virus antigen detection. The TBC used as active layer is soft, has a low modulus of 24 MPa, and can be stretched up to 90% with no crack formation of the film. The TBC is compatible with roll-to-roll printing, potentially enabling the fabrication of low-cost wearable or on-skin diagnostic platforms aiming at point-of-care concepts.

AB  - Introduction: Calibration equations offer potential to improve the accuracy and utility of self-report measures of physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB) by rescaling potentially biased estimates. The present study evaluates calibration models designed to estimate PA and SB in a representative sample of adults from the Physical Activity Measurement Study. Methods: Participants in the Physical Activity Measurement Study project completed replicate single-day trials that involved wearing a Sensewear armband (SWA) monitor for 24 h followed by a telephone administered 24-h PA recall (PAR). Comprehensive statistical model selection and validation procedures were used to develop and test separate calibration models designed to predict objectively measured SB and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) from self-reported PAR data. Equivalence testing was used to evaluate the equivalence of the model-predicted values with the objective measures in a separate holdout sample. Results: The final prediction model for both SB and MVPA included reported time spent in SB and MVPA, as well as terms capturing sex, age, education, and body mass index. Cross-validation analyses on an independent sample exhibited high correlations with observed SB (r = 0.72) and MVPA (r = 0.75). Equivalence testing demonstrated that the model-predicted values were statistically equivalent to the corresponding objective values for both SB and MVPA. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that simple regression models can be used to statistically adjust for overestimation or underestimation in self-report measures among different segments of the population. The models produced group estimates from the PAR that were statistically equivalent to the observed time spent in SB and MVPA obtained from the objective SWA monitor; however, additional work is needed to correct for estimates of individual behavior.

AB  - Background: A successful innovative medical device is not only technically challenging to develop but must also be readily usable to be integrated into health care professionals' daily practice. Through a user-centered design (UCD) approach, usability can be improved. However, this type of approach is not widely implemented from the early stages of medical device development.
   Objective: The case study presented here shows how UCD may be applied at the very early stage of the design of a disruptive medical device used in a complex hospital environment, while no functional device is available yet. The device under study is a connected sensor system to detect colorectal anastomotic leakage, the most detrimental complication following colorectal surgery, which has a high medical cost. We also aimed to provide usability guidelines for the initial design of other innovative medical devices.
   Methods: UCD was implemented by actively involving health care professionals and all the industrial partners of the project. The methodology was conducted in 2 European hospitals: Grenoble-Alpes University Hospital (France) and Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam (the Netherlands). A total of 6 elective colorectal procedures and 5 ward shifts were observed. In total, 4 workshops were conducted with project partners and clinicians. A formative evaluation was performed based on 5 usability tests using nonfunctional prototype systems. The case study was completed within 12 months.
   Results: Functional specifications were defined for the various components of the medical device: device weight, size, design, device attachment, and display module. These specifications consider the future integration of the medical device into current clinical practice (for use in an operating room and patient follow-up inside the hospital) and interactions between surgeons, nurses, nurse assistants, and patients. By avoiding irrelevant technical development, this approach helps to promote cost-effective design.
   Conclusions: This paper presents the successful deployment over 12 months of a UCD methodology for the design of an innovative medical device during its early development phase. To help in reusing this methodology to design other innovative medical devices, we suggested best practices based on this case.

AB  - Background: The effect of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on mortality after lung transplantation (LT) was assessed in some retrospective studies, with contradictory results. The first aim of this study was to assess the 90-day survival of LT recipients according to massive intraoperative transfusion (MIOT).
   Methods: This prospective, observational, single-centre study analysed the intraoperative transfusion (IOT) of all consecutive LT recipients between January 2016 and February 2019. MIOT was defined as transfusion of 5 RBC units or more. The results are presented as the median [IQR] and absolute numbers (proportions) and were analysed using chi(2), Fisher, and Mann-Whitney tests (p < 0.05 as significance). Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for MIOT, 90-day and oneyear mortality and grade 3 PGD at day 3. Ninety-day and one-year survivals were studied (Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank test). The Paris-North-Hospitals Institutional Review Board approved the study.
   Results: Overall, 147 patients were included in the analysis, 27 (18%) of them received MIOT. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors of MIOT included preoperative ECMO support (p = 0.017), and bilateral LT (p = 0.023). The SOFA score on ICU admission after LT was higher in cases with MIOT ( p < 0.001). MIOT was an independent risk factor for 90-days and one-year mortality (p = 0.002 and 0.008 respectively). The number of RBCs unit transfused during surgery was an independent risk factor for grade 3 PGD at day 3 (OR 1.14, 95% CI [1.00-1.29], p = 0.040).
   Conclusion: Increased preoperative severity of recipients predicts MIOT. MIOT is associated with increased early postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. (C) 2022 Societe francaise d'anesthe sie et de reanimation (Sfar). Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Adherence to once daily oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention can be challenging for men who have sex with men (MSM) with substance use. Digital pill systems (DPS) comprise a radiofrequency emitter integrated into a gelatin capsule containing PrEP, which transmits data to a wearable Reader following ingestion, thereby enabling direct, real-time adherence measurement. This study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and accuracy of a DPS to measure PrEP adherence. Methods: A 90-day, single-arm, open-label, pilot demonstration trial was conducted with adult, cisgender, HIV-negative MSM on PrEP with nonalcohol substance use. Feasibility was measured via DPS engagement and timeline followback. Acceptability was assessed via qualitative user experience interviews. Accuracy was evaluated via DPS performance metrics, pill counts, and DBS to quantify tenofovir diphosphate. Results: Sixteen MSM enrolled (median age, 32 years), and 15 completed the study. Engagement remained stable over time. Emergent nonadherence patterns included intercurrent substance use. The DPS was largely acceptable based on interviews; the predominant barrier to use was the Reader. DPS-recorded ingestions totaled 1099, including 83.9% were detected by Reader and 16.1% were reported manually. The DPS recorded 92.2% of 1192 total expected ingestions per pill counts. Point-biserial correlation (R = 0.58; 95% CI: 0.21 to 0.80; P = 0.047) and Pearson correlation (month 1: R = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.57 to 0.95; P = 0.0002; month 3: R = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.17 to 0.94; P = 0.0197) showed strong correlations between DPS-recorded adherence and tenofovir diphosphate in dried blood spots. Conclusion: DPS are a feasible, acceptable, and accurate method of measuring PrEP adherence in MSM with substance use. Future investigations should incorporate DPS into behavioral interventions targeting nonadherence.

AB  - Background: We aimed to describe the outcome of a computerized intravenous insulin infusion (CII) protocol integrated to the electronic health record (EHR) system and to improve the CII protocol in silico using the EHR-based predictors of the outcome.
   Methods: Clinical outcomes of the patients who underwent the CII protocol between July 2016 and February 2017 and their matched controls were evaluated. In the CII protocol group (n =91), multivariable binary logistic regression analysis models were used to determine the independent associates with a delayed response (taking >= 6.0 hours for entering a glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL). The CII protocol was adjusted in silico according to the EHR-based parameters obtained in the first 3 hours of CII.
   Results: Use of the CII protocol was associated with fewer subjects with hypoglycemia alert values (P=0.003), earlier (P=0.002), and more stable (P=0.017) achievement of a glucose range of 70 to 180 mg/dL. Initial glucose level (P=0.001), change in glucose during the first 2 hours (P=0.026), and change in insulin infusion rate during the first 3 hours (P= 0.029) were independently associated with delayed responses. Increasing the insulin infusion rate temporarily according to these parameters in silico significantly reduced delayed responses (P < 0.0001) without hypoglycemia, especially in refractory patients.
   Conclusion: Our CII protocol enabled faster and more stable glycemic control than conventional care with minimized risk of hypoglycemia. An EHR-based adjustment was simulated to reduce delayed responses without increased incidence of hypoglycemia.

AB  - A stretchable ultrasonic array conforming to the skin allows for the three-dimensional imaging of tissue modulus at depths of up to 4 cm.
   Serial assessment of the biomechanical properties of tissues can be used to aid the early detection and management of pathophysiological conditions, to track the evolution of lesions and to evaluate the progress of rehabilitation. However, current methods are invasive, can be used only for short-term measurements, or have insufficient penetration depth or spatial resolution. Here we describe a stretchable ultrasonic array for performing serial non-invasive elastographic measurements of tissues up to 4 cm beneath the skin at a spatial resolution of 0.5 mm. The array conforms to human skin and acoustically couples with it, allowing for accurate elastographic imaging, which we validated via magnetic resonance elastography. We used the device to map three-dimensional distributions of the Young's modulus of tissues ex vivo, to detect microstructural damage in the muscles of volunteers before the onset of soreness and to monitor the dynamic recovery process of muscle injuries during physiotherapies. The technology may facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases affecting tissue biomechanics.

AB  - Plasmonic nanostructures offer an enticing prospect in many applications, ranging from lasing to biosensing, due to their unrivaled light concentration beyond the diffraction limit. However, this promise is substantially undercut by the intrinsically high losses in metals. Here, an experimental ultra-high-Q plasmon resonance with a linewidth down to 2 nm (Q-factor approximate to 350) and a resonance intensity of 51% in an ultrasmooth gold nanogroove array is reported. Such an experimental ultranarrow resonance arises from two key factors. First, a geometrical-induced coupling between the Fabry-Perot and Wood's anomaly modes significantly suppresses the groove array's radiative damping. Second, an ultrasmooth gold surface fabricated by template stripping minimizes its surface scattering and grain boundary scattering. Benefiting from this ultranarrow resonance, a figure of merit (FOM) of 284 and an FOM* of 617 in refraction index (RI) sensing under normally incident detection are demonstrated, the former of which is the record FOM in all reported broad-RI-range plasmonic RI sensors. The array is further demonstrated as a surface thickness sensor for detecting mercaptocarboxylic acids with the surface sensitivity of 0.18 nm/CH2, which suggests that the array is a promising platform for thickness detection of surface analytes and label-free biomedical sensing.

AB  - A triaxial accelerometer worn on the thigh can provide information on the angle of rotation of the thigh. These data may be used to estimate periods of lying versus sitting.
   Purpose
   To develop and test a classification algorithm to identify sedentary events as either lying or sitting events using a thigh-worn, triaxial accelerometer.
   Methods
   Seven-day free-living activity from 14 sedentary workers was recorded using the activPAL3 (TM) monitor. Participants recorded when they went to bed and when they got up in a diary. All "in-bed" sedentary events were assumed to be lying and all "not-in-bed" sedentary events as sitting. An algorithm computed the angle of rotation of the y-axis, which was used to detect orientation of the thigh. Crossing a rotational threshold in the transverse plane of +/- 65 degrees was used to classify a sedentary event as lying. The classification accuracy of the algorithm was compared with self-reported classification from the diary.
   Results
   The algorithm classified 96.7% of the sedentary time "in bed" (sensitivity) as lying and 92.9% of the time "not in bed" as not lying (specificity).
   Conclusions
   Triaxial accelerometer data recorded from a single site on the thigh can be used to classify sedentary events as sitting and lying. The automated method developed in this study will allow objective measurement of diurnal lying time and that while sleeping without relying on self-report. This will help advance the understanding of the impact of different types of sedentary behaviors on various health outcomes.

AB  - The activPAL (TM) (AP) monitor is well established for distinguishing sitting, standing, and stepping time. However, its validity in predicting time in physical activity intensity categories in a free-living environment has not been determined. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the validity of the AP in estimating time spent in sedentary, light, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in a free-living environment. Methods: Thirteen participants (mean +/- SD age = 24.8 +/- 5.2 yr, BMI = 23.8 +/- 1.9 kgIm(-2)) were directly observed for three 10-h periods wearing an AP. A custom R program was developed and used to summarize detailed active and sedentary behavior variables from the AP. AP estimates were compared with direct observation. Results: The AP accurately and precisely estimated time in activity intensity categories (bias [ 95% confidence interval]; sedentary = 0.8 min [-2.9 to 4.5], light = 1.7 min [2.2-5.7], and -2.6 min [-5.8 to 0.7]). The overall accuracy rate for time in intensity categories was 96.2%. The AP also accurately estimated guideline minutes, guideline bouts, prolonged sitting minutes, and prolonged sitting bouts. Conclusion: The AP can be used to accurately capture individualized estimates of active and sedentary behavior variables in free-living settings.

AB  - Purpose The objective of this study is to compare the accuracy of the activPAL and ActiGraph GT3X+ (waist and thigh) proprietary postural allocation algorithms and an open-source postural allocation algorithm applied to GENEActiv (thigh) and ActiGraph GT3X+ (thigh) data.
   Methods Thirty-four adults (18 yr) wore the activPAL3, GENEActiv, and ActiGraph GT3X+ on the right thigh and an ActiGraph on the right hip while performing four lying, seven sitting, and five upright activities in the laboratory. Lying and sitting tasks incorporated a range of leg angles (e.g., lying with legs bent and sitting with legs crossed). Each activity was performed for 5 min while being directly observed. The percentage of the time the posture was correctly classified was calculated.
   Results Participants consisted of 14 males and 20 females (mean age, 27.2 5.9 yr; mean body mass index, 23.8 +/- 3.7 kgm(-2)). All postural allocation algorithms applied to monitors worn on the thigh correctly classified 93% of the time lying, 91% of the time sitting, and 93% of the time upright. The ActiGraph waist proprietary algorithm correctly classified 72% of the time lying, 58% of the time sitting, and 74% of the time upright. Both the activPAL and ActiGraph thigh proprietary algorithms misclassified sitting on a chair with legs stretched out (58% and 5% classified incorrectly, respectively). The ActiGraph thigh proprietary and open-source algorithm applied to the thigh-worn ActiGraph misclassified participants lying on their back with their legs bent 27% and 9% of the time, respectively.
   Conclusion All postural allocation algorithms when applied to devices worn on the thigh were highly accurate in identifying lying, sitting, and upright postures. Given the poor accuracy of the waist algorithm for detecting sitting, caution should be taken if inferring sitting time from a waist-worn device.

AB  - Aims: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular outcomes. Studies of patients with SDB have identified frequent night-time urination as a manifestation related to SDB. We aimed to clarify whether night-time frequency of urination is independently associated with SDB in a general population. We also investigated whether night-time frequency of urination can help presumptive diagnose SDB.
   Methods: Study participants consisted of 7151 community residents. Oxygen saturation during sleep was measured for four nights using a pulse oximeter. SDB was defined as >= 15 events per hour in which oxygen desaturation exceeded or equal to 3% during an actigraphy-determined sleep period. Night-time frequency of urination was recorded for one week using a sleep diary.
   Results: Significant positive correlations were evident between night-time frequency of urination and SDB (none, 5.8%; once/night, 14.1%; twice/night, 20.1%; thrice/night, 28.7%; >thrice/night, 44.1%, P < 0.001). This association was independent of possible covariates, including sleep duration (adjusted odds ratio: once/night = 1.50, twice/night = 2.15, thrice/night = 3.07, >thrice/night = 3.73, P < 0.001). Other factors significantly associated with SDB were age, sex, obesity, observation of sleep apnea, and short sleep duration. The area under the curve of the risk score for SDB consisting of these conventional six items (0.834) significantly improved (0.842, P = 0.001) when night-time frequency of urination was considered as a risk score item.
   Conclusion: Night-time frequency of urination was associated with SDB. Our findings suggest that the urination frequency should be considered a manifestation of SDB even in a general population. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To survey the prevalence and clinical and genetic characteristics of pachydrusen in eyes with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and those of Japanese individuals in the general population.
   Design: Prospective, observational cohort study.
   Participants: One thousand thirty-seven Japanese patients were included in this study. Three hundred seven patients (614 eyes) had treatment-naive CSC without choroidal neovascularization in either eye, whereas 730 individuals (1640 eyes) were Japanese individuals from the general population without explicit ocular diseases.
   Methods: Pachydrusen were detected using color fundus photography, and subfoveal choroidal thickness was measured using OCT. Genotypic distributions of 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms, ARMS2 A69S, CFH I62V, and CFH Y402H, were evaluated.
   Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of pachydrusen and association with choroidal thickness.
   Results: The prevalence of pachydrusen was significantly higher among CSC patients than among the general population group (40.1% vs. 15.6%; P < 0.001). Individuals with pachydrusen in either group were significantly older than those without pachydrusen (CSC patients: 62.1 years vs. 48.8 years [P < 0.001]; general individuals: 70.3 years vs. 51.9 years [P < 0.001]). No significant difference was found in subfoveal choroidal thickness between those with and without pachydrusen (CSC patients: 370 mu m vs. 375 mu m; [P = 0.574]; general population: 297 mu m vs. 303 mu m [P = 0.521]). However, after adjusting for age, gender, and refractive error, subfoveal choroidal thickness was notably thicker in individuals with pachydrusen than that in individuals without pachydrusen in both groups (P = 0.003 and P = 0.013, respectively). No significant difference was found in genotype distributions between CSC patients with pachydrusen and those without it; whereas, the T allele frequency of ARMS2 A69S was higher in general population individuals with pachydrusen than that in general population individuals without pachydrusen (42.2% vs. 33.9%; P < 0.001; OR, 1.86, adjusted for age, gender, and choroidal thickness).
   Conclusions: Pachydrusen was observed more frequently in CSC patients compared with individuals from the general population. In both groups, pachydrusen was associated with a thicker choroid, suggesting that pachydrusen should be considered as a significant sign of pachychoroid.

AB  - Gas generation-based immunoassay is considered an attractive biosensing platform for the detection of biomarkers by incorporating the target recognition event with a catalyzed gas-generating reaction. Herein, an optical gas pressure sensor based on a silver/polydimethylsiloxane (Ag/PDMS) bilayer system was designed as a signal transducer to read the concentration of the detection target alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) quantitatively. In this proposed pressure-based assay, silicon dioxide (SiO2) nanospheres decorated with platinum (Pt) nanoparticles were coupled to detect antibodies by covalent linkage, and the captured antibodies were conjugated with magnetic beads via streptavidin-biotin interaction, simultaneously. When the AFP was loaded, the Pt-catalyzed hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition reaction was triggered to induce a significant increase in the reflectance signal of the Ag/PDMS bilayer gas pressure sensor (BGPS) due to a "wrinkled-specular" transition of the Ag film's surface. Under optimal conditions, the pressure-based biosensor exhibited a broad linear detection range from 0.05 to 132 ng mL(-1) with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.016 ng mL(-1) for AFP, which satisfies the requirements for the clinical detection of AFP. Besides, the high specificity and detection accuracy of our Ag/PDMS BGPS also proved its feasibility for practical diagnosis.

AB  - Objective Radiographic changes in knee osteoarthritis (OA) are not always associated with symptoms, especially in its early stages. Ultrasonography (US) can detect early changes in the knee joint, but the changes that reflect symptoms have not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to identify US-detectable changes in the knee that are often associated with knee symptoms and demonstrate the feasibility of early diagnosis in symptomatic knee OA using US. Design In this cross-sectional community-based study, 1,667 participants aged >= 60 years (1,103 women [66%]) were included. All participants concurrently underwent US and radiography of the knee and completed the Knee Society Knee Scoring System (KSS) questionnaire. Simple and multiple regression analyses were used to examine the associations between US findings and KSS symptom subscales. Results Among all participants, medial meniscus protrusion and medial osteophytes, age, and body mass index showed significant associations with KSS symptom scores. Among 894 participants with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade <= 1, medial osteophytes and age were significantly associated with KSS symptom score. US measures were more related to KSS symptoms than KL grades. Conclusions Among the knee US-detectable changes, medial osteophytes were strongly associated with knee symptoms. Osteophytes are reliable predictors of symptomatic early knee OA, even in participants with few radiographic OA changes.

AB  - Endosomes are subcellular organelles which serve as important transport compartments in eukaryotic cells. Fluorescence microscopy is a widely applied technology to study endosomes at the subcellular level. In general, a microscopy image can contain a large number of organelles and endosomes in particular. Detecting and annotating endosomes in fluorescence microscopy images is a critical part in the study of subcellular trafficking processes. Such annotation is usually performed by human inspection, which is time-consuming and prone to inaccuracy if carried out by inexperienced analysts. This paper proposes a two-stage method for automated detection of ring-like endosomes. The method consists of a localization stage cascaded by an identification stage. Given a test microscopy image, the localization stage generates a voting-map by locally comparing the query endosome patches and the test image based on a bag-of-words model. Using the voting-map, a number of candidate patches of endosomes are determined. Subsequently, in the identification stage, a support vector machine (SVM) is trained using the endosome patches and the background pattern patches. Each of the candidate patches is classified by the SVM to rule out those patches of endosome-like background patterns. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated with real microscopy images of human myeloid endothelial cells. It is shown that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art competing methods using multiple performance metrics.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to develop models to predict new-onset overactive bladder in 5 years using a large prospective cohort of the general population. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a longitudinal cohort study in Japan. The baseline characteristics were measured between 2008 and 2010, with follow-ups every 5 years. We included subjects without overactive bladder at baseline and with follow-up data 5 years later. Overactive bladder was assessed using the overactive bladder symptom score. Baseline characteristics (demographics, health behaviors, comorbidities, and overactive bladder symptom scores) and blood test data were included as predictors. We developed two competing prediction models for each sex based on logistic regression with penalized likelihood (LASSO). We chose the best model separately for men and women after evaluating models' performance in terms of discrimination and calibration using an internal validation via 200 bootstrap resamples and a temporal validation. Results We analyzed 7218 participants (male: 2238, female: 4980). The median age was 60 and 55 years, and the number of new-onset overactive bladder was 223 (10.0%) and 288 (5.8%) per 5 years in males and females, respectively. The in-sample estimates for C-statistic, calibration intercept, and slope for the best performing models were 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.74-0.80), 0.28 and 1.15 for males, and 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.74-0.80), 0.20 and 1.08 for females. Internal and temporal validation gave broadly similar estimates of performance, indicating low optimism. Conclusion We developed risk prediction models for new-onset overactive bladder among men and women with good predictive ability.

AB  - Background and objective: Patient-reported outcome measures can provide clinicians with valuable information to improve doctor-patient communication and inform clinical decision-making. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physician-perceived utility of the QLQ-GINET21 in routine clinical practice in patients with gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (GI-NETs). Secondary aims were to explore the patient, clinician, and/or centre-related variables potentially associated with perceived clinical utility.
   Methods: Non-interventional, cross-sectional, multicentre study conducted at 34 hospitals in Spain and Portugal (NCT02853422). Patients diagnosed with GI-NETs completed two health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires (QLQ-C30, QLQ-GINET21) during a single routine visit. Physicians completed a 14-item ad hoc survey to rate the clinical utility of QLQ-GINET21 on three dimensions: 1)therapeutic and clinical decision-making, 2)doctor-patient communication, 3)questionnaire characteristics.
   Results: A total of 199 patients at 34 centres were enrolled by 36 participating clinicians. The highest rated dimension on the QLQ-GINET21 was questionnaire characteristics (86.9% of responses indicating "high utility"), followed by doctor-patient communication (74.4%), and therapeutic and clinical decision-making (65.8%). One physician-related variable (GI-NET patient volume > 30 patients/year) was associated with high clinical utility and two variables (older age/less experience treating GI-NETs) with low clinical utility.
   Conclusions: Clinician-perceived clinical utility of QLQ-GINET21 is high. Clinicians valued the instruments' capacity to provide a better understanding of patient perspectives and to identify the factors that had the largest influence on patient HRQoL.

AB  - Purpose: We aimed to determine whether clinical EEG reports obtained from children in the intensive care unit with refractory status epilepticus could provide data for comparative effectiveness research studies. Methods: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study to assess the documentation of key variables within clinical continuous EEG monitoring reports based on the American Clinical Neurophysiology Society's standardized EEG terminology for children with refractory status epilepticus from 10 academic centers. Two pediatric electroencephalographers reviewed the EEG reports. We compared reports generated using free text or templates. Results: We reviewed 191 EEG reports. Agreement between the electroencephalographers regarding whether a variable was described in the report ranged from fair to very good. The presence of electrographic seizures (ES) was documented in 46% (87/191) of reports, and these reports documented the time of first ES in 64% (56/87), ES duration in 72% (63/85), and ES frequency in 68% (59/87). Reactivity was documented in 16% (31/191) of reports, and it was more often documented in template than in free-text reports (40% vs. 14%, P = 0.006). Other variables were not differentially reported in template versus free-text reports. Conclusions: Many key EEG features are not documented consistently in clinical continuous EEG monitoring reports, including ES characteristics and reactivity assessment. Standardization may be needed for clinical EEG reports to provide informative data for large multicenter observational studies.
