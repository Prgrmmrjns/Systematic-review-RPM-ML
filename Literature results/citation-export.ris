N2  -  This is a monocenter Randomized Controlled trial to evaluate if continuous heart rate and ‐rhythm monitoring with a photoplethysmography (PPG) smartwatch wearable (Apple Watch series 5) can detect atrial fibrillation (AF) at an early stage in cardiac patients with a known high risk of developing AF (age ≥ 65), who are also at higher risk of developing stroke if AF would occur (ChadsVasc score ≥ 2 men; ≥3 women). The primary objective of this trial is to investigate whether continuous rhythm monitoring with a smartwatch wearable will result in a higher incidence of AF in patients at high risk for but without previously known AF, compared to standard care alone. The secondary outcomes are time to first AF episode, initiation of therapies for AF, predictors of AF, the number of visits to the emergency department, the number of patients with major adverse cardiovascular events, and other cardiac arrhythmias than AF diagnosed by a cardiologist. In this monocenter, single arm, prospective randomized controlled trial the investigators will enroll 306 patients. Patients will be randomized into either the intervention group (n=153), who will be loaned an Apple watch for use, or the control group (n=153), who will receive their standard care alone. Participants in the intervention group will receive the Apple Watch series 5 wearable and instructions to download a mobile app for the Apple iPhone. The smartwatch and the app on the smartphone are coupled. During the six‐month study period, continuous monitoring for at least 12 hours a day of heart rate and ‐rhythm will be conducted using PPG. If an irregular heart rhythm is detected, the participant is requested through the smart application to record a single‐lead ECG, using the smartwatch. Data obtained from the smartwatch will be transferred to the mobile app and will then be assessed with a proprietary certified AF algorithm. The ECG‐data will be automatically uploaded in a secure environment of a data center, where it is accessible for the Telecure team who will analyze and interpret the recordings. As soon as AF is newly diagnosed, the patient and the treating cardiologist will be informed. An absolute in between‐group difference of 8.5% in diagnosing patients with new AF in favor of the interventional group during a six month study period is hypothesized.

N2  -  Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, a smartwatch‐based sensor is utilized as a convenient tool to detect the abnormal RBD phenomenon in PD patients. Instead, a questionnaire with sleep quality assessment and sleep physiological indices, such as sleep stage, activity level, and heart rate, were measured in the smartwatch sensors. Therefore, this device can record comprehensive sleep physiological data, offering several advantages such as ubiquity, long‐term monitoring, and wearable convenience. In addition, it can provide the clinical doctor with sufficient information on the patient's sleeping patterns with individualized treatment. In this study, a three‐stage sleep staging method (i.e., comprising sleep/awake detection, sleep‐stage detection, and REM‐stage detection) based on an accelerometer and heart‐rate data is implemented using machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML‐based algorithms used here for sleep/awake detection, sleep‐stage detection, and REM‐stage detection were a Cole‐Kripke algorithm, a stepwise clustering algorithm, and a k‐means clustering algorithm with predefined criteria, respectively. The sleep staging method was validated in a clinical trial. The results showed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of abnormal REM between the control group (1.6 ± 1.3; n = 18) and the PD group (3.8 ± 5.0; n = 20) (p = 0.04). The percentage of deep sleep stage in our results presented a significant difference between the control group (38.1 ± 24.3; n = 18) and PD group (22.0 ± 15.0, n = 20) (p = 0.011) as well. Further, our results suggested that the smartwatch‐based sensor was able to detect the difference of an abnormal REM percentage in the control group (1.6 ± 1.3; n = 18), PD patient with clonazepam (2.0 ± 1.7; n = 10), and without clonazepam (5.7 ± 7.1; n = 10) (p = 0.007). Our results confirmed the effectiveness of our sensor in investigating the sleep stage in PD patients. The sensor also successfully determined the effect of clonazepam on reducing abnormal REM in PD patients. In conclusion, our smartwatch sensor is a convenient and effective tool for sleep quantification analysis in PD patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID‐19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet‐based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home‐based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home‐based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off‐the‐shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom‐developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl‐Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow‐up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop‐out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost‐effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

N2  -  Background: Smartwatches are FDA‐approved to detect atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined the associations between income level with anxiety, patient activation, and daily wear time in stroke survivors using smartwatches for AF detection. Methods: We analyzed data from the Pulsewatch study, a randomized controlled trial (NCT03761394) that enrolled participants aged ≥50 years with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, a CHA2DS2 VASc risk score ≥ 2, and no contraindication to anticoagulation. Participants in the intervention group wore a cardiac patch monitor in addition to a smartwatch and smartphone for AF detection, whereas participants in the control group wore only the cardiac patch monitor. At baseline, 14 days, and 44 days, participants completed General Anxiety Disorder‐7 and the Consumer Health Activation Index, which examined anxiety and patient activation, respectively. Adherence to the Pulsewatch system was measured by watch wear time. A longitudinal linear regression model was used to examine associations between baseline income (earning <$50K/yr. vs.≥$50K/yr.) and changes in anxiety, patient activation, and wear time over the study period. Results: A total of 95 participants were included in this study. Participants earning <$50K/yr. were 54.5% male and 90.9% white, while participants earning ≥$50K/yr. were 59.7% male and 88.7% white. At baseline, history of renal disease (12.1% vs 1.6%, 0.029), statin use (84.9% vs 96.8%, 0.034), depressive symptoms (65.6% vs 35.5%, 0.004), and anxiety symptoms (54.5% vs 18.3%, <0.001), were different between the income groups. The high‐income group was associated with reduced anxiety and greater activation (β ‐2.60, p‐value <0.001; β 7.83, p‐value 0.005, respectively) but not significantly associated with wear‐time (β 0.20, p‐value 0.50) among stroke survivors. Conclusion: Stroke survivors with high baseline income had reduced anxiety and greater engagement when randomly assigned to smartwatch use for AF detection. Baseline income may influence stress levels and engagement associated with smartwatch use. Studies are needed to evaluate how the prescription of wearable devices affects mood and activation among older adults from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

N2  -  Introduction: Motor impairments are the objectively most striking sequelae after stroke, but non‐motor consequences represent a high burden for stroke survivors as well. Depression is reported in one third of patients, the fatigue prevalence ranges from 23 to 75% due to heterogenous definitions and assessments. Cognitive impairment is found in one third of stroke patients 3–12 months after stroke and the risk for dementia is doubled by the event. Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, counteract fatigue, and improve cognitive functions in non‐stroke patients. Furthermore, exercise is known to strengthen the immune system. It is unknown, though, if aerobic exercise can counteract poststroke depression, fatigue, poststroke dementia and poststroke immunosuppression. Therefore, we aim to analyse the effect of aerobic exercise on functional recovery, cognition, emotional well‐being, and the immune system. Reorganization of topological networks of the brain shall be visualized by diffusion MRI fibre tracking. Methods: Adults with mild to moderate stroke impairment (initial NIHSS or NIHSS determined at the moment of maximal deterioration 1–18) are recruited within two weeks of stroke onset. Study participants must be able to walk independently without risk of falling. All patients are equipped with wearable devices (smartwatches) measuring the heart rate and daily step count. The optimal heart rate zone is determined by lactate ergometry at baseline. Patients are randomized to the control or the intervention group, the latter performing a heart rate‐controlled walking training on own initiative 5 times a week for 45 min. All patients receive medical care and stroke rehabilitation to the usual standard of care. The following assessments are conducted at baseline and after 90 days: Fugl Meyer‐assessment for the upper and lower extremity, 6 min‐walk test, neuropsychological assessment (cognition: MoCA, SDMT; fatigue and depression: FSMC, HADS‐D, participation: WHODAS 2.0 12‐items), blood testing (i.e. immune profiling to obtain insights into phenotype and functional features of distinct immune‐cell subsets) and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with grid‐sampled diffusion weighted imaging, white matter fibre tracking and MR spectroscopy. Perspective: This study investigates the effect of smartwatch‐controlled aerobic exercise on functional recovery, cognition, emotional well‐being, the immune system, and neuronal network reorganization in stroke patients.

N2  -  Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary tumor with poor prognosis and survival. Patients (pts) experience debilitating symptoms that have a negative effect on quality of life (QoL). A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to facilitate the reduction of morbidity, preserve QoL, and maximize benefits of treatment. Selinexor (SEL) is a first‐in class, oral, selective inhibitor of nuclear export that blocks exportin 1 approved for use in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma and has shown activity in GBM. Digital measurements in the KING study through wearable sensors and other devices capture actionable daily data at home for improved care, symptom management, and QoL, are reported here. Methods: XPORT‐GBM‐029 (NCT04421378) is an ongoing phase 1 dose finding study followed by an open‐label randomized phase 2, 5‐arm trial to evaluate SEL in combination with standard therapies for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM (n = 350): radiation+SEL /radiation and temozolomide; radiation and temozolomide±SEL; lomustine±SEL; bevacizumab±SEL; tumor treating field±SEL. The study is conducted at 18 sites in the US and Canada. GBM progression is assessed by standard clinical and imaging as well as QoL measurements by novel digital tools. Four parameters to determine the impact on QoL (cognitive function, lateralization, fatigue, sleep) are measured remotely by smartwatch and smartphone to continuously measure activity and sleep, and to complete a cognitive battery at baseline and before each MRI. Results: To date, pts wearing the smartwatch had higher compliance during the day for activity and gait measures compared to night for sleep measures. Younger pts had better compliance. Over the course of SEL treatment, changes were observed in balance (characterized by double support % and walking asymmetry) and activity level (characterized by step count and walking distance). Of the pts who participated in the cognitive battery (CANTAB) tests, 2 pts had a minor change in cognition measures including psychomotor and processing speed, episodic and spatial working memory, and executive function after 2 SEL treatment cycles. Overall, the CANTAB measures are stable, which align with the mRANO (MRI) results. The correlation between the CANTAB cognition measures and MRI data will be evaluated once more clinical data become available. Ongoing analyses will apply machine learning and statistical tools to determine potential correlations between digital and clinical data, such as physical examinations, AEs, Karnofsky scores, mRANO, NANO, KPS, and PRO QoL questionnaires. Conclusions: This is the first demonstration of digital measurement feasibility in a longitudinal study of pts with GBM. Digital measurements for pts with GBM could provide information on the impact of SEL‐based treatment and functional outcomes in clinical trials and increase communication between clinicians and pts, thereby improving QoL and care management.

N2  -  Objective: To implement and validate quantification of motor dysfunction in a Huntington's disease (HD) clinical trial using machine learning algorithmic analysis derived from biometric monitoring through a smartphone and wearable sensor combination. Background: Motor symptoms in HD are typically evaluated by clinicians using rating scales, such as the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score (UHDRS‐TMS). Assessments are infrequent, inherently subjective, may lead to intra‐ and inter‐rater variability, and are prone to placebo response. The use of biometric health solutions could enable objective, real‐time monitoring of motor dysfunction in both clinical research and patient care. Methods: Up to 60 HD patients with a pre‐defined spectrum of motor dysfunction will be included in a sub‐study of Open Pride‐HD (NCT02494778; Phase II, open‐label, extension study) after meeting a set of pre‐specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will be asked to use the biometric monitoring platform for 6 months. High‐ frequency movement‐tracking data will be collected using an iPhone and wearable Pebble smartwatch combination and streamed continuously to a secure cloud‐based analytics platform. 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data that reflect the intensity and direction of movements will be collected at the patients' homes and during in‐clinic visits. Results: The digital health sub‐study of Open Pride‐HD started enrolling patients in December 2016 with anticipated duration for up to 2 years. The collected information, comprising accelerometer data, app‐enabled patient‐reported severity assessments of motor dysfunction, and in‐clinic sessions, will be used to assess the validity of biometric monitoring as a means of providing reliable information on motor dysfunction in HD patients between and during clinic visits.

N2  -  The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after on‐pump cardiac surgery remains high, at around 30%. POAF increases the risk of cardiac decompensation, stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality, hospital length of stay, and cost of patient management. Episodes of POAF are usually paroxysmal and asymptomatic, increasing the risk of developing permanent AF at five years by 4 to 5 times. POAF occurs between 3 and 4 days after cardiac surgery, mainly when the patient is hospitalized in a surgical ward without heart rate monitoring as opposed to critical care, where the patient benefits from continuous rhythmic monitoring. The diagnosis of POAF is therefore made with the help of a 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) when the patient presents clinical symptoms and when the medical staff notes a significant variation in heart rate. However, many patients with episodes of asymptomatic POAF have a higher risk of stroke and mortality than those with symptomatic POAF. Faced with this public health problem, the development of tools for diagnosing AF is in full swing, mainly the marketing of smartwatches (SWs) that allow for the performance of 1‐lead ECG. SW is also equipped with algorithms to analyze heart rate variability and diagnose asymptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) episodes. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Association for Cardio‐Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) recommend the use of smartwatches to detect AF, in particular, to reduce the economic impact of AF. The aim of the study is to diagnose POAF within the first five days after patient discharge from the critical care unit for the cardiac surgery department.

N2  -  Research Objective: Lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) is the most common inpatient surgery for Medicare beneficiaries with substantial variation in cost and quality. Remote monitoring and insights from behavioral science have the potential to improve outcomes and value of care. We evaluated the impact of activity monitoring and bidirectional text messaging on the rate of patient discharge to home and clinical outcomes. Study Design: This was a three‐arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial conducted between February 2018 and April 2019 at two urban hospitals in a large academic health system (clinicaltrials. gov NCT0335549). Eligible patients were randomized evenly, with a waiver of informed consent, and stratified by hospital location and joint type (knee or hip) to receive (1) usual care, or (2) HomeConnect + . Intervention patients were invited to participate in HomeConnect+ by mailed invitation followed by up to 4 phone calls. Those who agreed received a wearable activity monitor (Withings) to track step counts, pain score tracking, messaging about post‐operative goals and milestones, and connection to clinicians as needed. Those in HomeConnect+ were further randomized evenly to (2a) remote monitoring alone or (2b) remote monitoring with gamification and social support. HomeConnect+ was offered before surgery, began at hospital discharge, and continued for 45 days post‐discharge. The primary outcome was discharge to home. Pre‐specified secondary outcomes included change in average daily step count from week 2 to week 6, rehospitalizations, and outpatient visits. Population Studied: We included patients aged 18‐85 scheduled to undergo lower extremity joint replacement surgery (knee or hip) with a Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool score of 6‐8. We excluded patients with dementia, end‐stage renal disease, cirrhosis, metastatic cancer, and those scheduled for bilateral or revision surgery. Principal Findings: A total of 242 patients were included in the analysis (124 usual care, 118 intervention) with a mean age of 66, including 78% female, 46% white, and 43% black patients. 81% in the intervention arm agreed to receive monitoring. There was no significant difference in the rate of discharge to home between the usual care (58%) and intervention (57%) arms; no difference in office visits between arms; and no significant increase in step count in those receiving remote monitoring plus gamification and social support compared to remote monitoring alone. There was a statistically significant reduction in rehospitalization rate in the intervention arm compared to the usual care arm (3.4% vs 12.2%; P = .01). Conclusions: The HomeConnect+ automated hovering program did not increase discharge to home from the hospital after LEJR surgery, and there was no difference in activity levels among those receiving gamification and social support compared to remote monitoring alone. However, there was a significant reduction in rehospitalizations among those receiving the intervention, which may have resulted from goal setting and connection to the care team. Implications for Policy or Practice: Automated hovering was not sufficient to increase discharge to home among patients with a moderate expected rate of facility placement. However, it has the potential to reduce hospitalizations after LEJR surgery, an important quality and value outcome for hospitals and payers.

N2  -  Approximately 13% of all children (2 ‐ 19 years old) are afflicted with NAFLD with the prevalence of NAFLD increasing to 60‐80% among youth with obesity. NAFLD is characterized by excessive deposition of fat in the liver, which is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Unchecked, NAFLD can progress into more severe forms of liver disease, including NASH, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which eventually can lead to liver transplantation or death. Unfortunately, treatment of NAFLD through lifestyle interventions is extremely challenging and minimally effective even under intensive conditions. Bariatric surgery has shown promise as a treatment approach in adults, but remains controversial for a treatment of NAFLD in pediatrics.Even if bariatric surgery is proven effective, the overall impact will be low since a very small proportion of adolescents with obesity opt for this extreme treatment. Moreover, surgery is not indicated in youth with milder forms of obesity or younger children and since NAFLD occurs across the entire age‐spectrum and is not exclusive to youth with obesity, a large need would be unmet by surgical treatment options. Therefore, novel non‐surgical approaches that complement lifestyle modification therapy are needed in order to advance the field in a meaningful way and to provide care to a wide‐range of youth with NAFLD. However, no safe or effective pharmacotherapy treatment options are presently available for youth with NAFLD, leaving a tremendous gap in care. Therefore, altering the gut microbiome through administration of a prebiotic dietary fiber is an attractive treatment option. To date, no medications have been successful at producing meaningful improvements in NAFLD among youth. Similarly, in adults, existing pharmacotherapy options elicit some improvement in liver enzymes and/or histology but have failed to demonstrate widespread efficacy. Moreover, most medications are not indicated for children under the age of 12, and pediatricians are adverse to using them until all other treatment options have failed. Therefore, alternative approaches must be taken in this difficult‐to‐treat clinical population to identify more effective treatment options. A prebiotic dietary fiber may offer a potential novel treatment option for NAFLD in children with obesity. Subjects who are interested in participating in the study will be asked to come in for a screening visit where their parent will sign a parental consent form and the child will sign an assent form. Blood will be drawn for safety tests and biomarker sampling. Urine and stool will also be collected. A portable glucose monitor will be placed to collect timed glucose results. Subjects will have an MRI to confirm their NAFLD and their BMI will be calculated. Subjects will undergo a dual x‐ray absorptiometry (iDXA) scan and lifestyle counseling. Subjects enrolled in this study will be randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either polylactose or the placebo. Subjects will take the polylactose or the placebo in foods provided by the study team (made in a food‐grade space utilizing good manufacturing practices to minimize cross contamination). Subjects will take polylactose/placebo for 26 weeks. They will come have blood drawn for safety tests and biomarkers at weeks 8 and 26. They will have urine and stool samples collected at weeks 8, 20 and 26. Assessments of their glucose levels will be done via a wearable glucose monitor between the screening/randomization and week 4, and again between week 20 and week 26. MRI scans of the liver iDXA scans will be repeated at weeks 8 and 26. Lifestyle counseling and assessment of adverse events, compliance with taking the study product/placebo and tolerability of the intervention will take place at weeks 4, 8, 13, 20 and 26.

N2  -  Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of ischemic stroke that, though critical to diagnose and treat, often goes undetected. Smartwatches are capable of AF detection, but little is known about their use among stroke survivors. In collaboration with stroke survivors and clinicians, we designed a smartphone‐smartwatch system for AF detection. In our ongoing clinical trial, we are examining the performance and user experience of the system in older stroke survivors. Hypothesis: The system will be accurate for AF detection among stroke survivors compared to 14‐ day ECG patch monitoring; participants will find the system usable and will adhere to daily use over 30 days. Methods: The Pulsewatch study is an ongoing two‐phased randomized controlled trial with randomization at two timepoints into control or intervention groups. Phase I (14 days) assesses accuracy and usability of the smartwatch and study app. Phase II (30 days) examines watch wear adherence. The intervention group receives a smartwatch with embedded AF detection and a smartphone app for rhythm and symptom tracking. Eligibility criteria are: >50 years old, ischemic stroke in the past decade, and no major contraindications to anticoagulation therapy. System accuracy for AF detection is compared to an ECG patch monitor, and usability is assessed via the System Usability Scale. Adherence is defined as daily watch wear time over the monitoring period. Results: To date, 69 participants have been randomized into phase I and 36 into phase II (mean age 65, 41% female, 87% White). The smartwatch system demonstrated a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI: 9.4 ‐ 99.2) and specificity of 92.6% (95% CI: 82.1 ‐ 97.9) for detection of 3 AF cases over the 14 day period (91.2% accuracy) compared to the ECG patch. The mean usability score was 65/100 and on average, participants wore the watch on 12/30 days for an average of 1.8 hours (SD 0.7) daily. Conclusion: A smartwatch and app dyad demonstrated reasonable accuracy for AF detection and high usability, though adherence was modest. Use of commercial wearables for AF detection among stroke patients shows promise, but additional data from the ongoing Pulsewatch clinical trial will continue to inform strategies to maximize adherence to these devices among older adults.

N2  -  Efficient methods for screening populations for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) are needed to reduce its associated mortality, morbidity, and costs. The use of digital technologies, including wearable sensors and large health record data sets allowing for targeted outreach toward individuals at increased risk for AF, might allow for unprecedented opportunities for effective, economical screening. The trial's primary objective is to determine, in a real‐world setting, whether using wearable sensors in a risk‐targeted screening population can diagnose asymptomatic AF more effectively than routine care. Additional key objectives include (1) exploring 2 rhythm‐monitoring strategies ‐ electrocardiogram‐based and exploratory pulse wave‐based ‐ for detection of new AF, and (2) comparing long‐term clinical and resource outcomes among groups. In all, 2,100 Aetna members will be randomized 1:1 to either immediate or delayed monitoring, in which a wearable patch will capture a single‐lead electrocardiogram during the first and last 2 weeks of a 4‐month period beginning immediately or 4 months after enrollment, respectively. An observational, risk factor‐matched control group (n = 4,000) will be developed from members who did not receive an invitation to participate. The primary end point is the incidence of new AF in the immediate‐ vs delayed‐monitoring arms at the end of the 4‐month monitoring period. Additional efficacy and safety end points will be captured at 1 and 3 years. The results of this digital medicine trial might benefit a substantial proportion of the population by helping identify and refine screening methods for undiagnosed AF.

N2  -  Background and aims: The lifetime risk of diabetic, neuropathic, plantar first foot ulceration is 25%, whereas ulcer recurrence rates for patients with ulcer history are 50‐70% within 5 years. To date, effective ulcer prevention strategies remain elusive. Foot ulcer development in the insensate foot is intimately linked to high peak plantar pressures and high pressure‐time integrals during gait as patients with diabetic neuropathy cannot detect aberrant pressures and do not adjust their walking strategy appropriately. We hypothesize that an intervention providing plantar pressure feedback would reduce aberrant high pressures developed during daily activities. We aimed to test efficacy of a novel plantar pressure‐sensing smart insole system, the SurroSense Rx® (Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc., Canada) in reducing DFU occurrence in 'high risk' diabetic patients. This system comprises pressure‐sensing inserts worn inside patients' footwear, recording continuous plantar pressure at eight sensor locations, during dayto‐ day life. When critical pressure thresholds are detected, a smartwatch feeds back to the patient via an alert and encourages off‐loading, to modify aberrant plantar pressures developed during daily activities. Materials and methods: In this randomised controlled trial, patients with recent history of DFU, peripheral neuropathy, no peripheral vascular disease, and no current DFU were recruited from two hospital sites within Greater Manchester, UK. Ninety participants were consented, 58 were randomized, all being set‐up with the pressure‐sensing inserts and smartwatch. Intervention group (IG) received feedback alerts from the smartwatch when pressures were 'high', whereas Control group (CG) did not receive alerts. At baseline, participants received device training and a detailed foot check. Patients were reviewed monthly for a foot check and system calibration. Follow‐up was for 18 months or until plantar ulceration occurred. Results: At follow‐up, there were 10 ulcers from 8,638 person‐days in CG and 4 ulcers from 11,835 person‐days in IG. A Poisson regression model compared the two groups on incidence of ulceration with log exposure days as offset and showed a 71% reduction in ulcer incidence in IG (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09‐0.93) relative to the CG (p = 0.037). Characteristics of CG (n = 26) vs. IG (n = 32) were: age, 67.1(9.6) vs. 59.1(8.5) [mean (SD)]; Type 1 diabetes, n = 4 (15.4%) vs. n = 9 (28.1%); duration diabetes, 21.2 (10.7) vs. 22.2 (14.3) years; HbA1c, 58 (41‐83) vs. 65.5 (38‐122) [median (range)] mmol/mol. In survival analysis, the Kaplan‐Meier graph and log‐rank test suggested no significant difference in treatment groups in time to ulceration (18 month ulcer‐free proportion: CG ‐ 68.4%, IG ‐ 77.5%; p = 0.30). Selfreported hours of wearing the device were: CG, 4.6 (2.9) vs. IG, 5.1 (3.0) hours/day, p = 0.63. Conclusion: Plantar pressure feedback and encouragement to offload throughout daily life via smartwatch alerts resulted in 71% lower DFU incidence after 18 months follow‐up. We conclude that there has been a significant, positive impact of this plantar pressure feedback intervention on reducing DFU incidence in 'high risk' diabetic patients.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Although electrocardiography is the gold standard for heart rate (HR) recording in clinical trials, the increasing availability of smartwatch‐based HR monitors opens up possibilities for drug development studies. Smartwatches allow for inexpensive, unobtrusive, and continuous HR estimation for potential detection of treatment effects outside the clinic, during daily life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the repeatability and sensitivity of smartwatch‐based HR estimates collected during a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: The data were collected as part of a multiple‐dose, investigator‐blinded, randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel‐group study of 12 patients with Parkinson disease. After a 6‐day baseline period, 4 and 8 patients were treated for 7 days with an ascending dose of placebo and clenbuterol, respectively. Throughout the study, the smartwatch provided HR and sleep state estimates. The HR estimates were quantified as the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles within awake and asleep segments. Linear mixed models were used to calculate the following: (1) the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of estimated sleep durations, (2) the ICC and minimum detectable effect (MDE) of the HR estimates, and (3) the effect sizes of the HR estimates. RESULTS: Sleep duration was moderately repeatable (ICC=0.64) and was not significantly affected by study day (P=.83), clenbuterol (P=.43), and study day by clenbuterol (P=.73). Clenbuterol‐induced changes were detected in the asleep HR as of the first night (+3.79 beats per minute [bpm], P=.04) and in the awake HR as of the third day (+8.79 bpm, P=.001). The median HR while asleep had the highest repeatability (ICC=0.70). The MDE (N=12) was found to be smaller when patients were asleep (6.8 bpm to 11.7 bpm) than while awake (10.7 bpm to 22.1 bpm). Overall, the effect sizes for clenbuterol‐induced changes were higher while asleep (0.49 to 2.75) than while awake (0.08 to 1.94). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the feasibility of using smartwatch‐based HR estimates to detect clenbuterol‐induced changes during clinical trials. The asleep HR estimates were most repeatable and sensitive to treatment effects. We conclude that smartwatch‐based HR estimates obtained during daily living in a clinical trial can be used to detect and track treatment effects.

N2  -  Background: Early detection of AF is critical for stroke prevention. Several commercially available smartwatches are FDA cleared for AF detection. However, little is known about how patient‐physician relationships affect patients’ anxiety, activation, and health‐related quality of life when prescribed smartwatch for AF detection. Methods: Data were used from the Pulsewatch study (NCT03761394), which randomized adults (>50 years) with no contraindication to anticoagulation and a CHA2DS2‐VASc risk score ≥2 to receive a smartwatch‐smartphone app dyad for AF monitoring vs. conventional monitoring with an ECG patch (Cardea SoloTM) and monitored participants for up to 45 days. The Perceived Efficacy in Patient‐Physician Interactions survey was used to assess patient confidence in physician interaction at baseline with scores ≥45 indicating high perceived efficacy in patient‐provider interactions. Generalized Anxiety Disorder‐7 Scale, Consumer Health Activation Index, and Short‐Form Health Survey were utilized to examine anxiety, patient activation, and physical and mental health status, at baseline, 14, and 44 days, respectively. We used mixed‐effects repeated measures linear regression models to assess changes in psychosocial outcomes among smartwatch users in relation to self‐reported efficacy in physician interaction over the study period. Results: A total of 93 participants (average age 64.1 ± 8.9 years; 43.0% female; 88.2% non‐Hispanic white) were included in this analysis. At baseline, fifty‐six (60%) participants reported high perceived efficacy in patient‐physician interaction. In the fully adjusted models, high perceived efficacy (vs. low) at baseline was associated with greater patient activation and perceived mental health (β 12.0, p‐value <0.001; β 3.39, p‐value <0.05, respectively). High perceived self‐efficacy was not associated with anxiety or physical health status (β − 0.61, p‐value 0.46; β 0.64, p‐value 0.77) among study participants. Conclusions: Higher self‐efficacy in patient‐physician interaction was associated with higher patient activation and mental health status among stroke survivors using smartwatches. Furthermore, we found no association between anxiety and smartwatch prescription for AF in participants with high self‐efficacy in patient‐physician interaction. Efforts to improve self‐efficacy in patient‐physician interaction may improve patient activation and self‐rated health and subsequently may lead to better clinical outcomes.KEY MESSAGES Higher self‐efficacy in patient‐physician interaction was associated with higher patient activation and mental health status among stroke survivors using smartwatches. No association between anxiety and smartwatch prescription for AF in participants with high self‐efficacy in patient‐physician interaction. Efforts to improve self‐efficacy in patient‐physician interaction may improve patient activation and self‐rated health and subsequently may lead to better clinical outcomes.

N2  -  Background: The detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in stroke survivors is critical to decreasing the risk of recurrent stroke. Smartwatches have emerged as a convenient and accurate means of AF diagnosis; however, the impact on critical patient‐reported outcomes, including anxiety, engagement, and quality of life, remains ill defined. Objectives: To examine the association between smartwatch prescription for AF detection and the patient‐reported outcomes of anxiety, patient activation, and self‐reported health. Methods: We used data from the Pulsewatch trial, a 2‐phase randomized controlled trial that included participants aged 50 years or older with a history of ischemic stroke. Participants were randomized to use either a proprietary smartphone‐smartwatch app for 30 days of AF monitoring or no cardiac rhythm monitoring. Validated surveys were deployed before and after the 30‐day study period to assess anxiety, patient activation, and self‐rated physical and mental health. Logistic regression and generalized estimation equations were used to examine the association between smartwatch prescription for AF monitoring and changes in the patient‐reported outcomes. Results: A total of 110 participants (mean age 64 years, 41% female, 91% non‐Hispanic White) were studied. Seventy percent of intervention participants were novice smartwatch users, as opposed to 84% of controls, and there was no significant difference in baseline rates of anxiety, activation, or self‐rated health between the 2 groups. The incidence of new AF among smartwatch users was 6%. Participants who were prescribed smartwatches did not have a statistically significant change in anxiety, activation, or self‐reported health as compared to those who were not prescribed smartwatches. The results held even after removing participants who received an AF alert on the watch. Conclusion: The prescription of smartwatches to stroke survivors for AF monitoring does not adversely affect key patient‐reported outcomes. Further research is needed to better inform the successful deployment of smartwatches in clinical practice.

N2  -  Aim: This paper presents the preliminary results from the ongoing REMOTE trial. It aims to explore the opportunities and hurdles of using insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) and photoplethysmography‐based mobile health (PPG‐based mHealth) using a smartphone or smartwatch to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in cryptogenic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. Methods and Results: Cryptogenic stroke or TIA patients (n = 39) received an ICM to search for AF and were asked to use a blinded PPG‐based mHealth application for 6 months simultaneously. They were randomized to smartphone or smartwatch monitoring. In total, 68,748 1‐min recordings were performed using PPG‐based mHealth. The number of mHealth recordings decreased significantly over time in both smartphone and smartwatch groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Insufficient signal quality was more frequently observed in smartwatch (43.3%) compared to smartphone recordings (17.8%, p < 0.001). However, when looking at the labeling of the mHealth recordings on a patient level, there was no significant difference in signal quality between both groups. Moreover, the use of a smartwatch resulted in significantly more 12‐h periods (91.4%) that were clinically useful compared to smartphone users (84.8%) as they had at least one recording of sufficient signal quality. Simultaneously, continuous data was collected from the ICMs, resulting in approximately 6,660,000 min of data (i.e., almost a 100‐fold increase compared to mHealth). The ICM algorithm detected AF and other cardiac arrhythmias in 10 and 19 patients, respectively. However, these were only confirmed after adjudication by the remote monitoring team in 1 (10%) and 5 (26.3%) patients, respectively. The confirmed AF was also detected by PPG‐based mHealth. Conclusion: Based on the preliminary observations, our paper illustrates the potential as well as the limitations of PPG‐based mHealth and ICMs to detect AF in cryptogenic stroke and TIA patients in four elements: (i) mHealth was able to detect AF in a patient in which AF was confirmed on the ICM; (ii) Even state‐of‐the‐art ICMs yielded many false‐positive AF registrations; (iii) Both mHealth and ICM still require physician revision; and (iv) Blinding of the mHealth results impairs compliance and motivation.

KW  -  Aphasia
N2  -  BACKGROUND AND TRANSLATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE Background Approximately 15 million individuals worldwide, including 795,000 Americans, suffer a new stroke each year. Aphasia, a disorder characterized by receptive and/or expressive language deficits, affects approximately 30% of stroke survivors and is one of the most devastating post‐stroke conditions. Aphasia is a heterogenous disorder, yet anomia (i.e., impaired word retrieval) is a persistent, ubiquitous impairment present in all people with aphasia (PWA). Neurotypical individuals occasionally experience anomia during "tip‐of‐the‐tongue" moments: frustrating instances when someone knows what they want to say but the word itself eludes them. For the two million Americans currently living with aphasia, word retrieval difficulties are far more severe and pervade all communication attempts. Anomia severity ranges between PWA, from mild difficulties such as delayed retrieval of low frequency words (e.g., amulet) to severe difficulty retrieving the names of even common objects (e.g., bed). Yet, regardless of severity, a hallmark of post‐stroke anomia is inconsistent word retrieval across attempts for a given word. For PWA, the ability to access words can change day‐to‐day and even minute‐to‐minute, resulting in diminished motivation to participate in conversations, disengagement from social interactions, and reduced quality of life. Per psycholinguistic models of lexical access, naming is a two‐step process that involves retrieval of the target's meaning from the semantic system and word form (speech sounds) from the phonological system. Naming failures in PWA result in errors that are related to a target word in meaning (e.g., "carrot" for bean), word form (e.g., "fean" for bean), both meaning and form (e.g., "green" for bean), or neither (e.g., "pencil" for bean; "I know it but I can't say it" for bean) due to insufficient activation of the target meaning/form representations or overactivation of incorrect representations. Due to this noisy system, lexical access is often delayed in PWA, even when the correct word is eventually retrieved. Naming accuracy, response times, and error types provide meaningful information regarding the locus of naming impairment and a patient's recovery capacity. The investigators found that the number of phonological and unrelated errors produced during early post‐stroke stages predicted longitudinal changes in naming and global language skills in left hemisphere stroke survivors. Naming errors and the integrity of underlying semantic and phonological systems can also guide language treatment planning. As such, accurate assessment of naming is critical for aphasia care. In clinical practice, speech‐language pathologists (SLPs) typically assess naming deficits through a single administration of a test in a quiet clinic room in a 1:1 interaction between the SLP and patient. Yet, given the variability in word retrieval, a one‐time assessment cannot accurately capture the true nature and extent of a patient's anomia. Moreover, unlike a controlled, contrived clinical environment, word retrieval in the real world usually occurs while an individual performs other daily tasks, often in distracting, noisy environments and with many other people present. The added cognitive load of multi‐tasking and suppressing external distractors adds to an already noisy lexical system, thereby increasing the chance of delayed or failed word retrieval. Traditional SLP assessment cannot capture the realities of real‐world anomia, but the investigators argue that ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can. EMA is a widely used method in health research to capture longitudinal self‐reported behaviors or states of interest (e.g., physical activity, depression, diet) in daily life. In traditional EMA, an electronic device prompts a participant to answer a set of questions (usually via button press) many times a day over time. Answering several questions at a time is time intensive, and thus, a key disadvantage of traditional EMA is interruption burden. In contrast, micro‐interaction‐based EMA (µEMA) reduces each prompt to a single question that can be answered in 3‐5s, allowing for many more questions interspersed over time. The investigators' pilot studies suggest that even with an interruption rate eight times more than traditional EMA, µEMA has higher response rates and lower perceived burden than traditional EMA. Furthermore, µEMA yields temporally dense in‐situ measures, making it an ideal tool for capturing the variability of anomia in the daily lives of PWA. One caveat is that an anomia µEMA/EMA protocol would necessitate recording verbal responses, yet traditional EMA and µEMA protocols to date have only required nonverbal responses via a button press or screen tap. The feasibility of capturing high‐quality audio responses in a µEMA or traditional EMA protocol is unknown. Moreover, despite the increasing use of technology‐based assessments and therapy platforms for aphasia, neither electronically delivered EMA nor µEMA has been tested in PWA. In fact, based on a review from 2020, only seven studies have used EMA to study stroke recovery and none targeted language impairments. A central question is whether stroke survivors with aphasia can adhere to electronically delivered traditional EMA or µEMA anomia protocols. Prior research regarding tablet and computer‐based platforms for aphasia indicates that PWA with better visuospatial attention and executive functions are better able to learn how to navigate a novel iPad application. Evidence suggests that SLP support is associated with greater adherence to a computerized therapy program for PWA and that patients' perceived engagement in the computer program is related to opportunities for practice, their ability to use the technology, and their motivation. An important step towards broader implementation of EMA and/or µEMA in aphasia is determining PWA's adherence to such protocols and which patient‐specific factors are associated with protocol adherence. Thus, as a future step toward broader‐scope research goals, in this pilot, the investigators will (1) determine the relative feasibility of two smartwatch‐delivered overt naming EMA protocols in PWA and (2) determine the extent to which patient‐specific factors (age, cognitive‐linguistic deficit severity, and comfort with technology) relate to feasibility. All participants will be scheduled to complete the same number of naming trials over the course of the experiment, but some PWA will be randomly assigned to a traditional EMA protocol (involving four prompts per day with nine naming trials per prompt) whereas other PWA will be assigned to a µEMA protocol (involving a single naming trial delivered at a time 36 times per day). Feasibility will be measured in three ways: in terms of (1) patients' ability to adhere to the EMA/µEMA protocol, (2) patients' perceived burden of completing the protocol, and (3) the capacity to capture recorded audio of naming attempts. The first two feasibility measures are similar to those used in the investigators' prior work, whereas the final measure is unique to this study since this pilot constitutes the first attempt at using EMA/µEMA to objectively measure verbal responses in stroke survivors Innovation Despite the small scope of this pilot study, several innovative features comprise this research. This pilot will be the first study to evaluate the feasibility of electronically delivered EMA protocols in stroke survivors with aphasia. The comparison of traditional EMA and µEMA protocols in a clinical population is also novel. This work will be critical in determining which delivery method works best for PWA who differ from previously‐studied neurotypical samples in meaningful ways. In addition, EMA research typically utilizes self‐report measures to catalogue mental or cognitive states in daily life. In contrast, this pilot will attempt to objectively measure the cognitive‐linguistic skill of naming through audio recordings of naming attempts in patients' daily lives. Such a paradigm has not been attempted before and thus, it is simultaneously original and risky with the potential for high reward. If it is feasible to obtain intelligible naming responses in an EMA/µEMA paradigm, this pilot study will yield unprecedented knowledge about PWAs' real‐world experiences with anomia. If it is not feasible to obtain high‐quality audio recordings from many participants, this pilot will still yield valuable knowledge regarding patients' ability to follow EMA/µEMA protocols and their perceived burden of EMA/µEMA. Translational Significance This research is at the T1: From Bench to Bedside stage, given that the primary goal of this proposal is to evaluate the viability of EMA/µEMA as a novel assessment tool of language impairments in PWA. Translational potential is intrinsic to EMA/µEMA methods. The field of SLP lacks objective measures of communication deficits in real‐life situations and the novelty and innovation of this work lies in working to remedy this problem. Findings from this study will inform a future NIH R01 application focused on verifying the criterion validity of EMA/µEMA in capturing anomia (in terms of accuracy, response rate, and naming error types) and determining the impact EMA/µEMA‐based anomia has on participation and quality of life in PWA compared to traditional anomia assessment. If successful, these methods can be expanded to measure other language domains (e.g., single‐word to phrase‐level auditory or reading comprehension) with personalized tasks tailored to patients' needs. Information gleaned from this study and the NIH R01 work also will be used to develop in‐situ, "just‐in‐time" ecological momentary interventions (EMI) for anomia in which smartwatch‐delivered prompts can intervene each time a patient experiences an anomic moment. The NIH R01 proposal, EMA/µEMA work into expanded language domains, and development of "just‐in‐time" EMI for anomia constitute three future directions of this pilot that also fall at the T1: From Bench to Bedside stage of the translational continuum. Therefore, in the future, the investigators will conduct research at the T2: From Bedside to Practice stage that will involve partnering with practicing SLPs and other healthcare professionals (e.g., physical and occupational therapists, physiatrists) at area rehabilitation hospitals or university‐based clinics (e.g., Northeastern University Speech, Language, and Hearing Center) to conduct EMA/µEMA and EMI clinical trials in PWA. This work will yield vital information about the efficacy of these methods in real clinical practice. Successful completion of T1 and T2 phase studies also will pave the way for work at the level of T3: From Clinical Practice to Widespread Clinical Practice and Care Delivery. Research at the T3 stage is realistic for this line of work given that smart technology costs will likely continue to drop, making smartwatches and phones more accessible to more people, and the variety and flexibility of digital mobile health applications will continue to rise, resulting in potential widespread clinical use of EMA/µEMA and/or EMI protocols. Thus, this research will begin a translational path that ideally ends in implementation of EMA/µEMA and EMI into routine clinical care of aphasia that is reimbursable by insurance providers. SPECIFIC AIMS The long‐term goal of this line of research is to be able to reliably measure real‐world language deficits in people with aphasia (PWA) with EMA/µEMA and to develop effective "just‐in‐time" interventions for PWA to improve their ease of everyday communication. As the first step towards this goal, the main objective of this proposal is to determine the relative feasibility of smartwatch‐delivered micro‐interaction ecological momentary assessment (µEMA) and traditional EMA as potential evaluation methods of aphasia. The secondary objective of this proposal is to determine which patient‐specific factors (age, cognitive‐linguistic deficit severity, and comfort with technology) are related to feasibility metrics. Twenty PWA will participate in this pilot study, randomly assigned to the µEMA condition (n = 10) or traditional EMA condition (n = 10). In both the µEMA and traditional EMA protocols, the smartwatch will vibrate to alert the participant to a prompt to complete either a single picture naming trial (in the µEMA condition) or a set of picture naming trials (in the traditional EMA condition). After the vibration, the participant will see a "Ready?" screen in which they must press a YES button for the picture to appear, and then they will attempt to name the picture aloud. Participants in both conditions will be scheduled to complete 36 overt picture naming trials per day for three weeks. The only difference between conditions will be the trial delivery schedule: PWA in the µEMA condition will complete a single naming trial at a time, 36 times per day whereas PWA in the traditional EMA condition will receive four prompts per day to complete a set of nine picture naming trials per prompt. The two‐fold rationale for comparing µEMA and traditional EMA protocols is that the investigators will be able to ensure the results reflect the viability of µEMA or traditional EMA specifically and not just the novelty of smartwatch use, and this approach will provide preliminary data regarding which method works best for which PWA. As previously referenced, investigators will index feasibility in three ways. First, investigators will measure patients' adherence to the µEMA or traditional EMA schedule via two objective measures: compliance and completion. Because smartwatch µEMA/EMA has not been tested in PWA, investigators do not know PWAs' capacity for adhering to the protocol by pressing a button or providing a verbal response. Therefore, investigators will disentangle feasibility of button press responses to smartwatch‐delivered µEMA/EMA from the feasibility of obtaining intelligible audio from the overt naming protocol. To do so, the YES/NO button tap responses to the "Ready?" screen will be used to calculate compliance. Similar to the investigators' prior work, compliance will be determined by considering the total number of YES button responses over the total number of scheduled prompts, including trials missed due to the watch being uncharged or turned off. On the other hand, completion will reflect PWAs' adherence to all smartwatch protocol steps, including pressing the YES button, seeing the picture(s), and attempting to name the picture(s) aloud. Therefore, completion will be calculated by considering the total number of naming attempts (indexed by the number of audio clips with an audible voice recording, disregarding intelligibility) over the total number of prompts delivered to the watch, excluding trials missed due to the watch being uncharged or off. Second, investigators will obtain patient‐reported measures of perceived burden measured via Likert‐scale questions on weekly surveys administered during weeks 2‐4. Third, SLP graduate student RAs will code each picture naming audio clip as being either completely intelligible, partially intelligible, or completely unintelligible; this categorical speech intelligibility rating will provide a gross measure of feasibility of obtaining audio recordings of naming attempts in µEMA/EMA in PWA. With these data, investigators will address the following aims: Aim #1: To compare feasibility measures (compliance, completion, perceived burden, and speech intelligibility) between the µEMA and traditional EMA conditions. Hypothesis: Based on the investigators' prior work, investigators predict PWA in the µEMA condition will demonstrate higher compliance and completion and report lower perceived burden than PWA in the traditional EMA condition. Investigators also predict that speech intelligibility will be greater in the µEMA condition than the traditional EMA condition because situational factors that disrupt recordings in a given moment (e.g., background noise, distance between the participant's mouth and the smartwatch) will be more likely to disrupt several trials in a row (as in the traditional EMA condition) than trials that are interspersed throughout the day (as in the µEMA condition). Aim #2: To determine the extent to which patient‐specific factors (age, cognitive‐linguistic deficit severity, and comfort with technology) relate to feasibility measures. Hypothesis: Controlling for study condition, investigators predict that older age, more severe aphasia, worse non‐linguistic cognitive skills (visuospatial and executive control abilities), and greater discomfort with technology will be associated with poorer compliance, lower completion, higher perceived burden, and poorer intelligibility of audio recordings during naming attempts across the entire group (n = 20 PWA). RESEARCH PROCEDURES Approach Participants ‐ Twenty adults with aphasia (18‐89 years old) will complete the proposed protocol. Inclusion criteria will be: (1) current/pre‐stroke English proficiency, (2) normal/corrected‐to‐normal vision and hearing, (3) medical stability, (4) history of left hemisphere stroke at least six months prior to enrollment, and (5) presence of aphasia as determined by consideration of scores on language assessments (e.g., Quick Aphasia Battery, discourse tasks) and the study team's clinical judgment (spearheaded by Dr. Meier). The reason for this two‐pronged approach for determining aphasia presence is that widely‐used comprehensive aphasia batteries are not reliably sensitive to mild aphasia, particularly for detecting less severe anomia. The exclusion criterion will be a history of neurological disease affecting the brain besides stroke. Methodology ‐ This study is for a longitudinal, controlled observational study. PWA will be randomly assigned to either a µEMA or traditional EMA condition. Week 1: Participants will complete two, two‐hour sessions: (1) an initial intake and evaluation session followed by (2) an EMA/µEMA protocol training session. Week 1, session 1 tests will include: (1) the Quick Aphasia Battery (QAB) to measure overall aphasia severity, (2) the Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test and Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test from the NIH Cognition Toolbox to measure non‐linguistic visual attention and executive functions, respectively, (3) brief, standardized picture description and story elicitation tasks to index anomia in discourse, and (4) an overt object naming test to index word retrieval via a standard SLP assessment format (i.e., single administration in a quiet 1:1 interaction). The naming test will include normed real photos of the 260 items from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart stimuli set. PWA will also participate in an intake interview and complete a questionnaire about their comfort with technology, adapted for aphasia (simple language, short phrases) with responses scaled from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree. Due to their aphasia, PWA will require more training on using the smartwatch than neurotypical samples from prior µEMA/EMA studies. Thus, week 1, session 2 will focus on training activities, including: 1. Smartwatch Orientation: PWA will be oriented to the smartwatch (interface, charging, etc.) through simple verbal and written instructions and visual demonstrations. 2. EMA Task Training: PWA will be instructed on the specific EMA/µEMA naming task, including instructions on how to tap on the screen and the optimal approach for providing verbal responses (i.e., mouth close to the watch). Then, PWA will complete an 18‐item traditional EMA‐style naming task probe (i.e., several trials back‐to‐back on the smartwatch) in a quiet room in The Aphasia Network (TAN) Lab at Northeastern University. During this probe, SLP graduate student research assistants (RAs) will provide cueing and feedback so that PWA successfully learn how to operate the smartwatch and respond to prompts. 3. µEMA or EMA Protocol Simulation: PWA will complete a "real‐world" µEMA or EMA task probe in a distracting environment (i.e., coffee shop or university bookstore on Northeastern's campus). For this final activity, over a 45‐minute period, 18 smartwatch prompts will be given, either randomly interspersed with one naming trial per prompt (for PWA in the µEMA condition) or split into two sets of 9 trials per prompt (for PWA in the EMA condition). This final activity will mirror the week 2‐4 µEMA/EMA protocols. Weeks 2‐4: PWA will complete either the µEMA or EMA protocol, depending on randomization. µEMA and EMA protocols will be delivered via a Fossil Sport Android smartwatch (or equivalent) provided by the study team. In each condition, the smartwatch will vibrate to alert PWA to a single naming trial (µEMA condition) or naming trial set (traditional EMA condition). After the vibration alert, PWA will see a screen that says "Ready to name a picture?" (µEMA condition) or "Ready to name some pictures?" (traditional EMA condition). If the participant taps YES, a picture will appear, and the device will begin recording audio. PWA will have up to five seconds to provide an oral response, after which a "Thanks!" screen will appear. The five‐second response window was selected based on research showing that PWA correctly name pictures within 3.5 seconds, on average, with longer response latencies for incorrect responses. If a participant fails to respond to a vibration prompt or pushes the NO button to the "Ready?" screen, they will be re‐prompted five minutes later via one more vibration alert. During weeks 2‐4, each participant will attempt to name 108 unique objects derived from the 260‐item Snodgrass and Vanderwart photoset. The subset of pictures presented to each participant will be based on their naming evaluation (during week 1, session 1). When possible, half of the pictures will be items the PWA named correctly during the evaluation, and the other half will be incorrectly named pictures. This approach will allow us to gauge naming variability over time of items PWA are able versus unable to name during traditional SLP assessment, providing an important window into anomia. To mitigate practice effects, the individual pictures (µEMA condition) or picture sets (traditional EMA condition) will be presented randomly without replacement until all 108 pictures have been presented, and then the picture cycle will restart. In both conditions, 36 naming trials will be scheduled per day, resulting in a total of 756 scheduled trials for each participant across the experiment. In the µEMA condition, single‐naming trial prompts will appear at random intervals from 10am to 8pm. In the EMA condition, PWA will receive four prompts per day to complete a set of nine picture naming trials per prompt; one prompt will be scheduled in every 2.5‐hour block between 10am and 8pm. Each night, participants will place the watch on a charger. Each morning, a smartphone provided by the study team will beep to alert the participant to take the smartwatch off the charger. The smartphone also will push the data collected by the smartwatch to the study team's server. At the end of each week, PWA will complete a 16‐item survey about their µEMA/EMA experiences during the prior week. Surveys will be administered via Qualtrics and as needed, will be facilitated by SLP graduate student RAs via video conferencing software. Week 5: In a final session at TAN Lab, PWA will return the smartwatch, complete the 260‐item Snodgrass and Vanderwart picture naming test, and participate in a study exit interview. Family, friends, or care providers involved in assisting the PWA with any aspects of the protocol will also be asked to complete an exit interview. Statistical Analyses ‐ Aim #1: Investigators will code each trial in the µEMA or EMA time series to index compliance, completion, and speech intelligibility. Every scheduled trial (n = 756 total trials) will be coded as 0 for a non‐response/NO button response or 1 for a YES button response, reflecting compliance. Every delivered trial with a naming attempt captured on audio (n trials will vary by person) will be coded as 0 for incomplete or 1 for complete, reflecting completion. Every audio clip (n trials will vary by person, depending on the number of naming attempts) will be coded as 0 for completely or partially unintelligible and 1 for completely intelligible, reflecting speech intelligibility. For each of these three measures, investigators will run a logistic mixed effects model with one of the feasibility measures (i.e., compliance, completion, or speech intelligibility) as the dependent variable, condition (µEMA or EMA) as the independent variable, and random effects of participant and trial. For perceived burden, investigators will collect responses on three questions/survey for three weeks. Given the small amount of data, survey responses will be plotted to visualize trends in increasing/decreasing burden rather than compared statistically. Aim #2: Investigators will conduct a series of partial correlations between patient‐specific factors and feasibility measures (compliance, completion, speech intelligibility, and perceived burden), controlling for study condition. Patient‐specific factors will include age, aphasia severity (derived from the QAB), non‐linguistic cognitive skills (averaged performance on the two NIH Toolbox tasks), and a summary score derived from the comfort with technology survey. Here, compliance will be the proportion of YES button responses divided by total scheduled trials (YESbutton/756) for each participant. Completion will be the proportion of naming attempts divided by total delivered trials (n naming attempts/n trials delivered). Speech intelligibility will be the proportion of completely intelligible responses divided by the total number of naming attempts (n completely intelligible trials/n naming attempts). Perceived burden will be calculated as the sum of all burden question Likert responses. Multiple comparison correction will be done at a false discovery rate of p < 0.05. Sample size/power: For the Aim #1 logistic mixed effects models, two groups of 10 PWA per group will achieve 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 1.20 in a design of 756 repeated measures with a AR(1) covariance structure and when the correlation between observations of the same subject is 0.600 and alpha is 0.05. If the proportion of completed trials for the EMA group is 0.500, a statistically significant result will occur if the µEMA group proportion is 0.545 or greater. In Intille et al, the mean difference in proportions between the µEMA and EMA conditions was >0.20 for compliance and completion, which is much higher than the needed 0.045 difference. This suggests investigators will have ample power to detect significant differences between the two conditions. For Aim #2, to achieve 80% power with 20 participants and alpha at 0.05, Pearson correlation coefficients will need to be 0.59 or greater. Due to the small but feasible sample of this pilot, investigators may not achieve such effects, but these data will be critical for power calculations for the NIH R01. Further, investigators will have a wealth of information to describe qualitative trends in patient‐specific factors, even if significance for Aim #2 is not achieved.

N2  -  Covid‐19, a commonly severe respiratory tract infection caused by the SARS‐CoV2 Coronavirus, poses an increasing threat to individual health and health care systems. The individual disease course ranges from mild to life threatening, the pandemic spread leads to a shortage of health care resources including intensive care availability. It should be the overarching goal to allocate sparse health care resources to those most at need and to simultaneously avoid unnecessary blocking of resources by clinically unjustified hospitalizations. Individuals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions are at the highest risk of health deterioration, even at younger age. Objective criteria for hospitalization are not immediately available in a outpatient settings. Hence, hospitalization and emergency medical contact is often triggered by subjectively interpreted symptoms. The goal of this project is thus to improve the availability of objective measurements in the outpatient setting by means of an innovative, smartwatch mediated telemedicine approach. To achieve this goal, the investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing a smartwatch based telemedicine intervention with standard of care. The intervention group will receive regular objective measurements of heart rate, ECG, and SpO2 and will get access to a 24/7 medical care hotline for consultation. The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group will benefit by a significant reduction in unnecessary hospitalizations and unplanned emergency medicine contacts.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: In‐person, exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation improves physical activity and reduces morbidity and mortality for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, activity levels may not be optimized and decline over time after patients graduate from cardiac rehabilitation. Scalable interventions through mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to augment activity levels and extend the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: The VALENTINE Study is a prospective, randomized‐controlled, remotely‐administered trial designed to evaluate an mHealth intervention to supplement cardiac rehabilitation for low‐ and moderate‐risk patients (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04587882). Participants are randomized to the control or intervention arms of the study. Both groups receive a compatible smartwatch (Fitbit Versa 2 or Apple Watch 4) and usual care. Participants in the intervention arm of the study additionally receive a just‐in‐time adaptive intervention (JITAI) delivered as contextually tailored notifications promoting low‐level physical activity and exercise throughout the day. In addition, they have access to activity tracking and goal setting through the mobile study application and receive weekly activity summaries via email. The primary outcome is change in 6‐minute walk distance at 6‐months and, secondarily, change in average daily step count. Exploratory analyses will examine the impact of notifications on immediate short‐term smartwatch‐measured step counts and exercise minutes. CONCLUSIONS: The VALENTINE study leverages innovative techniques in behavioral and cardiovascular disease research and will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how to support patients using mHealth technologies to promote and sustain physical activity.

N2  -  PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, HerBeat, compared with educational usual care (E‐UC) for improving exercise capacity (EC) and other patient‐reported outcomes at 3 mo among women with coronary heart disease. METHODS: Women were randomized to the HerBeat group (n = 23), a behavior change mHealth intervention with a smartphone, smartwatch, and health coach or to the E‐UC group (n = 24) who received a standardized cardiac rehabilitation workbook. The primary endpoint was EC measured with the 6‐min walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular disease risk factors and psychosocial well‐being. RESULTS: A total of 47 women (age 61.2 ± 9.1 yr) underwent randomization. The HerBeat group significantly improved on the 6MWT from baseline to 3 mo (P = .016, d = .558) while the E‐UC group did not (P = .894, d =‐0.030). The between‐group difference of 38 m at 3 mo was not statistically significant. From baseline to 3 mo, the HerBeat group improved in anxiety (P = .021), eating habits confidence (P = .028), self‐efficacy for managing chronic disease (P = .001), diastolic blood pressure (P = .03), general health perceptions (P = .047), perceived bodily pain (P = .02), and waist circumference (P = .008) while the E‐UC group showed no improvement on any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth intervention led to improvements in EC and several secondary outcomes from baseline to 3 mo while the E‐UC intervention did not. A larger study is required to detect small differences between groups. The implementation and outcomes evaluation of the HerBeat intervention was feasible and acceptable with minimal attrition.

N2  -  The LETHE pilot trial is a 24‐month multicentre parallel‐group randomised controlled trial conducted in Finland (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare, THL), Austria (Medical University of Vienna, MUW), Sweden (Karolinska Institute, KI), and Italy (University of Perugia, UPG). LETHE is an academic‐led trial (funded by EU Commission) where all four clinical centers are jointly and equally responsible for the planning and conduct of the trial. The recruitment goal is 160 participants (40 per country). Participants will be recruited e.g., through public announcements or advertisements (newspaper, social media) and at the local study centres. Interested individuals will first be pre‐screened to check the key inclusion criteria related to e.g., age, digital skills and readiness, and risk factor profile (CAIDE dementia risk score). Persons who appear to meet the inclusion criteria (and no reasons for exclusion have arisen) are then invited for the actual screening assessment visit (organised remotely or in‐person) where the eligibility criteria are checked in detail (including cognition). Exclusion criteria are assessed by a physician (for those who meet the inclusion criteria). Eligible individuals are invited to the baseline visit at the study centre. After completing all baseline assessments, participants are randomised in 1:1 ratio to the intervention group (structured ICT‐assisted multimodal lifestyle intervention) and control group (self‐guided multimodal lifestyle intervention). Randomisation will be balanced across sites. At the beginning of the study, all participants receive an Android smartphone (unless they have already a compatible phone which they prefer to use), first with a simplified version of the LETHE App installed where participants can complete a set of outcome assessment questionnaires (e.g., lifestyle‐related). After randomisation, a visit is booked to hand out the Fitbit smartwatch (different versions for the intervention and control groups) and install the full study version of the App (also different for the different groups). The App and the smartwatch are used for both active and passive data collection throughout the trial, and to support the intervention delivery. The intervention group will be offered a structured and tailored multimodal lifestyle programme (based on the FINGER model) including regular in‐person (face‐to‐face and remote) counselling and sessions led by professionals, as well as independent digital activities in the LETHE App. Sessions and activities are related to the following intervention components: physical activity, nutrition, cognitive activity, vascular risk management and monitoring, social interaction, sleep, and relaxation/stress management. Recommendations and plans are tailored. The LETHE App, which has been designed by the LETHE consortium for this project, has features such as e.g., a cognitive training program, on‐demand exercise videos, calendar to schedule activities, advice and educational material, group chat, and possibility to set and monitor goals and self‐monitor risk factors such as e.g., blood pressure. Participants in the self‐guided group are instructed to build their own lifestyle programme based on general health and lifestyle recommendations that they will receive at the main study visits. They will also have access to a simplified version of the LETHE App with static educational content about healthy lifestyle, but without any structured and scheduled activities, interactive features, or personalised content. After baseline, all participants are invited to the study centre for three main study visits to collect outcome information, at month 6, 12, and 24. The outcome assessors are blinded to the group allocation and participants are not actively told to which group they were assigned. Data collection through the digital devices takes place continuously. The primary objective of the trial is to assess the feasibility of the digitally supported multimodal lifestyle intervention programme, i.e., assess retention rate (what proportion of participants completes the 24‐month intervention period) and adherence to the intervention and engagement with the digital tools. Furthermore, changes in validated dementia risk scores (CAIDE, LIBRA) are assessed. Other objectives include testing the intervention effects on lifestyle and different risk factors of cognitive decline and dementia, cognitive performance, physical functioning, health‐related quality of life, health literacy, and dementia‐related fluid and imaging biomarkers. Participants' experiences of study participation and views on e.g., the usability and acceptability of the digital tools will also be explored (through interviews/focus groups).

N2  -  Background: Stable angina pectoris (SAP) is a highly common condition. Despite optimal medical treatment (OMT) patients often remain symptomatic and at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In daily practice the standard treatment consists of OMT usually followed by an invasive strategy, consisting of coronary angiography and subsequent coronary revascularization. However, recent studies showed that these costly and invasive procedures do not result in superior effects on re‐events and prognosis as compared to drug therapy alone in patients with SAP. On the other hand, the effect of lifestyle‐related interventions on vascular function and the progression of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is well‐known. Yet, contemporary RCTs comparing lifestyle interventions with coronary revascularization in patients with SAP are lacking. Purpose: To compare the impact of a 12‐month cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme versus a routinely applied invasive approach (including coronary angiography and subsequent coronary revascularization) on anginal complaints and cost‐effectiveness in SAP patients. We hypothesize that CR is at least equally effective as an invasive approach. Methods: 216 SAP patients with residual anginal complaints under OMT will be randomized to usual care or a 12‐month CR intervention aiming at angina relief and sustainable behavioural change for long‐lasting improvement in cardiovascular health. The CR programme consists of multiple lifestyle interventions including an exercise programme, a dietary intervention and a psychoeducation module with a stepped decline in guidance by health care professionals. Patients in the CR group will receive access to an online platform, a chatbot and a smartwatch enabling patients and professionals to monitor the progress and adherence to lifestyle advices. During the first 3 months patients will receive face to face guidance, the next 3 months will consist of telerehabilitation using the smartwatch with weekly video consulting and the last 6 months will be focussed on relapse prevention and guidance on demand. The primary outcome will be the quantity of anginal complaints (evaluated by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire‐7) following the 12‐month intervention. Secondary outcomes include cost‐effectiveness, the ischemic threshold during exercise, cardiovascular events, exercise capacity, quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing. Future implications This will be the first study evaluating a comprehensive disease‐specific multimodal lifestyle intervention as a primary treatment for patients with SAP. If proven successful this study will have a great impact on the daily care of these patients as coronary revascularizations can partly be replaced by a less invasive, less costly and better sustainable treatment.

N2  -  The use of wearables is increasing and data from these devices could improve the prediction of changes in glycemic control. We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist‐worn or wrist‐worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist‐worn wearables were used vs. waist‐worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is of pivotal importance for stroke prevention. Recent studies confirmed the merits of long‐term monitoring. Currently available diagnostic tools are burdened with disadvantages of inconvenience, costs or invasiveness. In a previous study we tested an app that employed photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals of a smartphone camera to distinguish between AF and sinus rhythm (SR) based on the newly developed Preventicus Heartbeats algorithm. That retrospective study has been shown to achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 95%. In the WATCH AF study, this algorithm is tested for the first time with PPG signals from a smartwatch (Samsung) and a wristband (Wavelet health). Our study aims to determine the accuracy of these applications compared to an ambulatory ECG system. METHODS: In this prospective, blind, international, multicenter‐study, 600 subjects are being recruited until March 2017. Subjects must be of legal age. SR group is ageand gender‐matched with the AF group. Pulse wave curves will be recorded for five minutes simultaneously with a smartwatch on one and a wristband on the other arm (sides randomized). At the same time, an ambulatory ECG system will record a synchronous ECG as a reference. The pulse wave curve data will be analysed in a blinded manner off‐line with the Preventicus Heartbeats algorithm and will then be labelled as either SR or AF. Additionally, information about cardiovascular risk factors, concomitant disease and medication are collected. Primary target parameters are the app's sensitivity and specificity in correctly detecting AF compared to an automatically interpreted ECG. Secondary target parameters include the proportion of non‐evaluable recordings in the overall study and differences between the two devices. RESULTS: The enrolment is expected to be complete in March 2017. Complete trial results are expected for in May 2017. CONCLUSION: WATCH AF is the first study to validate PPG signals from the wrist to detect AF in a blinded, ECG controlled fashion.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: The objective of this research is to determine whether health technologies can be utilised in specialist chronic disease clinics to deliver lifestyle interventions to improve the management of cardiometabolic risk in individuals with complex chronic conditions. There will be two groups; an intervention group and a control group randomised to a 1:1 ratio. Intervention: ‐ Participants will undergo education for increasing physical activity in line with Australian National Guidelines (30minutes daily, up to 150minutes per week of aerobic and resistance activity) and aligning with heart healthy dietary eating patterns. The Healthy heart dietary education will focus on increasing intake of fruit/veg/wholegrains/healthy proteins, reduction of foods with added salt/sugars and promotion of healthy fat choices such as nuts and olive oil). Education is focused on food choice and dietary pattern with no specific education around weight reduction even though weight loss may occur as a result of dietary change. The intervention will last for 26 weeks. All intervention participants will receive a one‐on‐one baseline dietary assessment and education session with an accredited practicing dietitian. The first session will be one‐on‐one for the health professional to determine any individual specific needs, but all remaining appointments will be group base and delivered via telehealth or technology assisted contact such as online information or text messages. Participants will receive an information booklet and then can choose a range of review strategies including group video 1hr dietitian review (offered monthly), group video 1hr exercise sessions (offered weekly), text message support with frequency from 1 ‐ 3 per week to reinforce advice, information, motivation and s CONDITION: Cardiometabolic Health;Solid Organ Transplant Recipients;Chronic Kidney Disease;Metabolic Syndrome; ; Cardiometabolic Health ; Solid Organ Transplant Recipients ; Chronic Kidney Disease ; Metabolic Syndrome Cardiovascular ‐ Other cardiovascular diseases Diet and Nutrition ‐ Obesity Metabolic and Endocrine ‐ Other metabolic disorders Physical Medicine / Rehabilitation ‐ Other physical medicine / rehabilitation ; • Intervention development: including programming of the software and technical staffing. ; • Intervention delivery: Information on health care resource use associated with the intervention will be collected, including the cost of the telehealth‐delivered coaching (training, call duration, call attempts, phone call cost, SMS, overheads), cost of automated SMS system, staff time, and software required. ; Participants will be asked to record any health care utilisation in a diary (provided at week 0) during the course of the study which will be returned at week 26 and reviewed at week 26 across both groups. ; [Week 26] The secondary outcomes will evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the program on reducing cardiometabolic risk, and the economic impact of the program. The outcomes will be assessed using the following measures: ; 1. Clinical Effectiveness ‐ assessed at baseline (pre‐randomisation) and repeated at 26 weeks ; [week 0 and week 26] INCLUSION CRITERIA: Participants will be considered eligible when they meet the following INCLUSION CRITERIA: a) Aged greater than or equal to 18 years b) Under the care of at least one of the following Princess Alexandra hospital specialist clinics (liver, renal) or under the care of the Ipswich hospital chronic kidney disease clinic; d) Screened as safe to exercise unsupervised; e) Deemed medically suitable to participate by their treating specialist; f) Have current access to a phone/mobile device or computer hardware with internet access and capabilities for webcam attachment; and PRIMARY OUTCOME: The primary outcome will evaluate the feasibility of technology assisted patient‐led lifestyle interventions to inform future implementation of this model of care into usual practice assessed at the end of the 26‐week program as a composite of: ; ; 1. Recruitment and refusal rate: ; Recruitment rate will be measured as the number of patients recruited from the pool of eligible patients referred to dietetics and invited to participate within a 6 month recruitment period. Refusal rate will be recorded with descriptive demographic data such as age; aeitiology of primary diagnosis; time post transplant (if applicable); gender; location and reason for refusal if participant is willing to disclose. ; 2. Retention rate: ; Study retention will be calculated as the inverse of attrition (due to drop‐out or safety concerns) at 26 weeks in both study groups. Retention will also explore the demographics and clinical characteristics of those participants that drop out compared to those remaining in the trial.; 3. Exposure demand, uptake and adherence to dietary and physical activity interventions:; Exposure demand: Due to the nature of patient choice embedded into the intervention, the range of exposure to the intervention delivery across the participant groups will be documented. This will include capturing the range of combinations of request to access technology to support health behaviour change including number and frequency of text messages requested, number of group telehealth diet and exercise appointments booked. This will be used to determine whether people in the target population are interested in health technologies to assist with lifestyle change. ; Participant uptake: For each of the optional group exercise and dietary education sessions offered and online content, number of participants who sign up for group sessions and number of views of online content will be measured and their demographic and clinical characteristics will be collected to inform intended uptake. ; Adherence rates: The proportion of those who sign up for each optional group exercise and dietary session will be matched against attendance at each telehealth group exercise and dietary session. ; 4. Safety:; The safety of the intervention will be monitored and any study‐related serious adverse events of interest (cardiac, orthopaedic, musculoskeletal) including hospitalisation, symptom development or injury will be recorded and compared to the control group. ; ; The criteria for safety and feasibility have been chosen based on a thorough review of feasibility studies in the literature, the desire for non‐inferiority outcomes from current usual care and the need for sustainability if this model of care was to be rolled out in real world practice. ; ; Feasibility success will be determined if it is safe and if 2 or more of the feasibility criteria are met:; Safety defined as:; • The proportion of study‐related serious adverse events in the intervention group is similar to the control group. ; ; 2 or more of these criteria to be met; Recruitment rate: ; • >/= 50% of all eligible patients are recruited;; Retention rate:; • >/= 70% of intervention participants complete the study ; Exposure demand, uptake and adherence to dietary and physical activity interventions:; • Group exercise and dietary sessions each have attendance of at least 80%.; • >/= 75% of participants in the intervention group receive higher frequency of health professional contact compared to average number of contacts in control group; [week 0 and week 26] g) Provide written informed consent. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Confidence: Likert scales of patient’s perception of confidence in managing their diet and exercise will be measured. [Week 0 and Week 26] Dietary Quality: Dietary data collected using the research version of the Easy Diet Diary phone app (Research Food Diary) and analysed in FoodWorks (version 10). This data will be used to compare dietary quality of both groups at baseline and post intervention as measured by dietary intake changes from baseline in serves per day of (i) core food groups (fruit, vegetables, meats and alternatives, dairy and alternatives, and grains and cereals); (ii) fibre; and (iii) discretionary food [Week 0 and Week 26] Fatigue will be measured using the FACIT fatigue scale version 4[Week 0 and Week 26] Participant satisfaction and acceptability (mixed method) Using semi‐structured interviews with a subset of purposively sampled intervention participants ; [Week 26] Physical Activity and Physical Function: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) long form survey will be used to measure habitual physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Weekly time spent in moderate and vigorous physical activity will be measured by a wearable activity monitor. Physical function will be determined by functional tests: sit‐to‐stand, grip strength and 6‐min walk tests, measured by a trained health practitioner. [Week 0 and Week 26] Quality of Life will be measured using the EQ‐5D‐5L Quality of life questionnaire[Week 0 and Week 26] Sleep quality and quantity will be measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) survey and collection of sleep data from the wearable activity monitor (total minutes awake, minutes of REM sleep, minutes of light sleep, minutes of deep sleep and an overall sleep quality score rated out of 100)[Week 0 and Week 26] The economic analysis will evaluate an estimate of costs related to development and delivery of the intervention will be captured to provide a healthcare provider perspective, as well as a patient perspective based on the estimated impact of the intervention on food costs: will include changes to total costs, assessed by healthcare utilisation (hospital admissions, appointments with specialist, GP and allied health) and implementation costs c) Have at least one of the following features of MetS: hypertension, obesity (by BMI >30kg/m2 or central obesity), dyslipidemia (raised fasting triglyceride or low HDL cholesterol), raised fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes; ; • MetS Severity Score A MetS Severity Score based on clinical thresholds from an Australian population, will be calculated ‐ This is a z‐score calculated as continuous risk assessment score. MetS severity score is calculated using the five parameters of the MetS including: waist circumference (measuring tape to nearest 0.5 centimetre), systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured as mean of three assessments with automatic sphygmomanometer with 1 min rest in between measures, fasting serum triglycerides, HDL‐cholesterol and glucose. The score calculated gives an indication of MetS status compared to others. A score below 0 indicates a lower degree of MetS than the average adult, a score close to 0 indicates an average degree of MetS. Scores over 0 are associated with greater risk for future disease and scores >1 indicate high prevalence MetS.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Baseline physical activity in patients when they initiate cardiac rehabilitation is poorly understood. We used mobile health technology to understand baseline physical activity of patients initiating cardiac rehabilitation within a clinical trial to potentially inform personalized care. METHODS: The VALENTINE (Virtual Application‐Supported Environment to Increase Exercise During Cardiac Rehabilitation Study) is a prospective, randomized‐controlled, remotely administered trial designed to evaluate a mobile health intervention to supplement cardiac rehabilitation for low‐ and moderate‐risk patients. All participants receive a smartwatch and usual care. Baseline physical activity was assessed remotely after enrollment and included (1) 6‐minute walk distance, (2) daily step count, and (3) daily exercise minutes, both over 7 days and for compliant days, defined by >8 hours of watch wear time. Multivariable linear regression identified patient‐level features associated with these 3 measures of baseline physical activity. RESULTS: From October 2020 to March 2022, 220 participants enrolled in the study. Participants are mostly White (184 [83.6%]); 67 (30.5%) are female and 84 (38.2%) are >65 years old. Most participants enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation after percutaneous coronary intervention (105 [47.7%]) or coronary artery bypass surgery (39 [17.7 %]). Clinical diagnoses include coronary artery disease (78.6%), heart failure (17.3%), and valve repair or replacement (26.4%). Baseline mean 6‐minute walk distance was 489.6 (SD, 143.4) meters, daily step count was 6845 (SD, 3353), and exercise minutes was 37.5 (SD, 33.5). In a multivariable model, 6‐minute walk distance was significantly associated with age and sex, but not cardiac rehabilitation indication. Sex but not age or cardiac rehabilitation indication was significantly associated with daily step count and exercise minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline physical activity varies substantially in low‐ and moderate‐risk patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation. Future studies are warranted to explore whether personalizing cardiac rehabilitation programs using mobile health technologies could optimize recovery. REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.

N2  -  Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves physical activity (PA) and reduces morbidity for patients with cardiovascular disease. We understand little of baseline PA as patients initiate CR, particularly when outside of CR. We used mobile health (mHealth) technology to understand baseline PA of patients initiating CR within a clinical trial to potentially inform personalized care. Methods: The Virtual AppLication‐Supported Environment to INcrease Exercise During Cardiac Rehabilitation Study (VALENTINE) Study is a prospective, randomized‐controlled, remotely administered trial designed to evaluate an mHealth intervention to supplement CR for low‐and moderate‐risk patients. Participants are randomized after 2 CR sessions; all receive a smartwatch and usual care. Remotely administered baseline PA outcomes include 6‐minute walk distance, step count, and exercise minutes. Baseline PA was assessed for 7‐days after study enrollment for compliant days, defined by >8 hours of watch wear/day. Multivariable linear regression identified features associated with baseline PA. Results: From October 19, 2020 to January 31, 2022, 180 participants enrolled. Participants are mostly White [156 (86.7%)]; 59 (32.8%) are female and 69 (38.3%) are > 65 years old. Most enrolled in CR after coronary revascularization [114 (64.4%)] or valve intervention [40 (22.2%)]. Comorbidities include hypertension (65.0%), valve disease (35.6%), and heart failure (17.8%). Participants were compliant for 91.4% of days with 15.3 (4.0) hours/compliant day. Baseline PA included 6‐minute walk distance of 491.8 (147.8) meters, daily step count of 6818 (3386), and exercise minutes of 36.0 (33.4). Substantial variation in baseline PA assessed by 6‐minute walk distance was noted across age and gender but not CR indication. Conclusions: Understanding baseline PA as participants enroll in CR may be useful in personalizing CR programs at initiation and designing mHealth interventions.

N2  -  Introduction: Early detection of silent atrial fibrillation (AF) followed by adequate intervention facilitates to prevent stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events. MybeatTM is a cutaneous patch type new device that continuously records electrocardiography for up to 5 days and automatically analyses using new algorithm based on RR intervals. (Figure 1) Hypothesis: We hypothesized that this novel device could detect silent AF in asymptomatic patients with known risk factors. Methods: We conducted a multicenter randomized study and tested the diagnostic utility of this novel device in screening silent AF. Inclusion criteria were ≥65 years and ≥1 of the following risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. We excluded patients with prior AF, implantable pacemaker, and previous palpitation or syncope. Thus, we enrolled 300 participants and divided them into group using MybeatTM wearable device (Mybeat group, N=150) or group underwent 24‐hour Holter monitoring (control group, N=150) for screening AF. AF was defined using particular algorithm based on the heartbeat fluctuation and was confirmed by the 2 weeks Holter electrocardiogram. (Figure 2) Results: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. (Table1) In the Mybeat group, the ratio of AF detection was significantly higher than that of control group (Mybeat vs. control, 16[10.7%] vs. 7[4.7%]; P=0.04). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that prior heart failure was independent predictor of silent AF (Table 2, OR 5.33; 95%CI 1.21‐48.56; P=0.01). We observed a 10.5‐fold difference in silent AF between an individual with 1 point and ≥4‐point CHADs2‐Vasc scores. Conclusions: The novel patch type device using original algorithm was useful for screening of silent AF.

N2  -  Full Title: QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF TRAINING EFFECTS USING A WEARABLE EXOSKELETON IN PARKINSON DISEASE PATIENTS RESEARCH PLAN Specific Aims The ability to walk independently is a primary goal when rehabilitating an individual with Parkinson Disease (PD). Indeed, PD patients display a flexed posture that coupled with an excessive joint stiffness lead to a poor walking mechanics that increase their risk of falls. Although studies have already shown the many benefits of robotic‐assisted gait training in PD patients, research focusing on optimal rehabilitation methods has been directed towards powered lower‐limb exoskeleton. Combining the advantages delivered from the grounded devices with the ability to train in a real‐world environment, these systems provide a greater level of subject participation and increase subject's functional abilities while the wearable robotic system guarantees less support. The purpose of the proposed work is to evaluate the effects of an Over‐ground Wearable Exoskeleton Training (OWET) on gait impairments in comparison with a multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment. As gait is a complex task that involves both central (CNS) and peripheral nervous systems (PNS), targeted rehabilitation must restore not only gait mechanics (ST parameters) but also physiological gait pattern (joint kinematics and dynamics). To this aim the impact of OWET on both CNS and PNS will be evaluated. Human movement analysis quantitatively assesses the neuromuscular and biomechanical features of movement. Recent literature has highlighted the benefit of coupling gait analysis (GA) and neuromusculoskeletal modeling (NMSM) for treatment planning and supplementing this approach with robotic rehabilitation. Another stalwart of PD research has been electroencephalography (EEG), which is widely used to evaluate executive dysfunction while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can detect cortical changes in motor activations during motor tasks. Thus, a quantitative assessment of an individual's gait and neuromuscular function to robustly evaluate recovery of altered sensorimotor function at both the PNS and CNS is proposed. To this aim, comprehensive GA (spatiotemporal (ST) parameter, joint kinematics, joint stiffness) and electromyography (EMG) will be combined to determine PNS improvements, and fMRI with EEG will be used to assess CNS improvements. As health care professionals and researchers need objective, reliable, and valid tools to plan subject‐specific interventions, quantify therapeutic outcomes, and monitor change over time, the proposed study includes estimation of neutrally‐informed muscle forces and joint stiffness, which is expected to provide sensitive determinants of PD movement control that could be crucial to inform treatment planning/assessment. Preliminary data are available and showed feasibility of the proposed measurement set up. Background OWET: Although studies have already shown the many benefits of robotic‐assisted gait training in PD patients (i.e. body weight supported treadmill training) as improving gait efficiency modifying spatiotemporal (ST) parameters, these strategies create an environment where the patient has less control over the gait initiation and lacks in variability of visuospatial flow. Therefore, research focusing on optimal rehabilitation methods has been directed towards powered lower‐limb exoskeleton, as in post‐stroke rehabilitation, where the effect of such a treatment dramatically enhanced potential for patient‐specific rehabilitation, showing improvement in ST parameters. Combining the advantages delivered from the grounded robotic devices with the ability to train the patient in a real‐world environment, these systems provide a greater level of subject participation for maintaining trunk and balance control, as well as navigating their path over different surfaces and increase subject's functional abilities while the wearable robotic system guarantees less support. Furthermore, the stability the exoskeleton addresses to the patient, allows a hands‐free walking trial (with no clutches) which represents an integral part for a physiological locomotion restoration. As gait involves both CNS and PNS, targeted rehabilitation must restore not only mechanics (speed, stride time and length) but also physiological gait pattern. This requires improvements at the level of both balance and lower limb joint motion. In this direction, wearable lower‐limb powered exoskeletons promote functional training in a realistic walking‐environment combined with a greater patient's engagement than in grounded devices. Human movement analysis quantitatively assesses the neuromuscular and biomechanical features of movement. Recent literature has highlighted the benefit of coupling GA and NMSM for treatment planning and supplementing this approach with robotic rehabilitation, however there is no study investigating gait effects from an OWET in those with PD, and no assessment that uses comprehensive GA and NMSM to reveal mechanistic changes as a result of therapy. Neurophysiology of PD: A stalwart of PD research has been EEG, which is widely used to evaluate executive dysfunction while fMRI can detect cortical changes in motor activations during motor tasks. The protocol to use GA in combination with fMRI has already been adopted by the investigators in order to display the impacts of the rehabilitation process on the reorganization of the neural network, describing and quantifying the neural activity and the recovery after the treatment. Motion analysis in PD: Gait in people with PD has been thoroughly studied with 3D GA systems in recent years, documenting a typical hypokinetic gait reduction of the stride‐length with asymmetry between the strides, an increment of the cadence, the stance and double support phases, which compensates for the reduced stride length. NMSM: Combining GA and NMSM enables one to track disease progression with enhanced precision. This has been demonstrated across a range of neuromuscular pathologies and healthy individuals. Critically, for each individual a neuromusculoskeletal model is created, driven by the individual's own EMG signals, and tracking their biomechanics, as has recently applied in neurologically impaired individuals. This creates a novel model that links in vivo neuromuscular functions to the individual, thus providing new biomarkers to assess and track PD motor impairment. Furthermore, since joint stiffness depends both on neural recruitment and mechanical properties, it is likely to provide a potent representation of neural and musculoskeletal PD impairment. Significance and potential impact This project addresses the potential for OWET to restore normal gait in PD patients. OWET aims to improve overall body motion and lower joint stiffness in those with PD, thereby improving function, quality of life, and reducing risk of injurious falls. The proposed robotic device (Ekso GT™, EksoBionics, Richmond, CA, USA) relies functions by providing passive assistance to the ankle joint, which affects the rest of the body through mechanical coupling. Currently, the amount of device assistance is estimated based on a therapist experience and expertise. Modern motion analysis methods enable us to objectively assess the required assistance providing a means to tailor the assistance to each individual and remove the risks of clinical guesswork. Robotic devices assist the physical therapist by providing task‐specific repeatable mechanical action to support therapies and enable higher intensity of training. OWET aims to reduce lower limb joint stiffness, which is a recognized biomarker of PD, thereby enhancing rehabilitation for PD patients. Findings linked with the proposed study will likely give substantial solutions to the management of gait and postural disorders (posture, balance, and gait) in PD where valid interventions (pharmacological, neurosurgery, traditional physiotherapy) are lacking. Moreover, a NMSM that identifies patient‐specific variables for therapy could be used to assess treatment outcomes but also to conduct on‐line rehabilitation therapy by means remote control of the assistive device. This will provide a number of advantages over conventional approaches proposing an active treatment that is personalized and scalable to large populations and including a standardized training environment and an adaptable support that has the ability to increase the treatment intensity and dose, without being a burden on therapists. OWET is thus an ideal means to complete conventional therapy in clinic, while rehabilitation robots bear the potential for continued home therapy using simpler devices. Study design The study will be carried out over 36 months. Patients with clinically established diagnosis of PD according to the U.K. Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Diagnostic criteria will be recruited. The diagnosis will be reviewed by a neurologist specialized on movement disorders. Briefly, 50 patients with mild to moderate disease severity, will be enrolled according to the inclusion\exclusion criteria included in the dedicated section below. The activities will be organized into 4 work packages (WP), each with measurable outputs verified by scheduled deliverables/milestones. ‐ WP1: Clinical Trial. The sample size has been defined based on published data of gait velocity in PD subjects, and a target sample of fifty PD individuals (divided in two separate cohorts) has been selected to achieve a power of at least 80% for detecting a mean group differences in mean gait velocity (p = 0.05). One cohort (n=25) will undergo a multidisciplinary intensive rehabilitation treatment, and the other will be treated with OWET. At baseline (T0) subjects will undergo neurophysiological evaluation (EEG‐fMRI) and GA. Participants will then undergo an 8‐weeks OWET. After the therapy (T1), the subjects will be evaluated, with the same protocol as at T0. After another 2 months, a follow‐up (T2) will be conducted using the same protocol as T0. ‐ WP2: Motion analysis. State‐of‐the‐art posture and GA will be performed pre‐ and post‐rehabilitation. ‐ WP3: NMSM. Using the data collected in WP1 and WP2, NMSM will be performed to obtain muscular force and joint stiffness. This NMSM will be used to assess PD neuromuscular function pre‐ and post‐rehabilitation. ‐ WP4: Neurophysiological assessment. A 256 channel High Density EEG (HD‐EEG) recordings and analysis will be used to assess brain oscillation activity changes before and after the treatment. Multimodal brain imaging will be performed by simultaneous acquisition and analysis of neurophysiological signals (EEG/EMG) and fMRI data to assess the resting state connectivity and activation differences between pre‐ and post‐treatment and to identify if the changes in the cortical activity is linked with the changes detected in WP3. Anticipated Results Locomotor functions are positively recovered by a functional gait training. Indeed, in post‐stroke subjects, patients who underwent this therapy have already shown to be more likely to achieve an independent walking than people who did not receive the same treatment. OWET will improve quality of gait and balance. Effects with OWET will impact the quality of life. The results with OWET will provide innovative information for rehabilitative programs. The impact of the intervention will be assessed by measurable outcomes listed in the dedicated section below.

N2  -  A. Specific Aims/Objectives: • Primary Aim: Determine if Rubato Life (RL) music selection is effective at reducing anxiety (STAI‐S) in cancer patients undergoing restaging. B. Background and Significance The field of music‐based interventions (MBI) is growing rapidly as part of the treatment of patients with chronic diseases such as schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease, dementia, chronic pain and cancer (Sihvonen et al., 2017). MBI can be divided into Music Therapy (MT) and Music Medicine (MM). In MT, patients are guided through a music intervention by trained music therapist. In MM, patients listen to live or recorded music, or participate in other music interventions without the personalized care of a music therapist (Stanczyk et al., 2011). Music listening has been shown to reduce anxiety, and lower blood pressure (Panteleeva et al., 2018), as well as help patients cope with negative emotions (Miranda and Claes, 2009). Previous studies have shown that MBI in the form of MM is a valuable addition to the treatments of patients diagnosed with cancer by improving outcomes and helping patients cope with the mental and emotional strain that accompanies their disease (Bradt et al., 2015; Gramaglia et al., 2019; Jasemi et al., 2016). Other studies also found that there is a growing interest in MBI among patients with cancer (Burns et al., 2005). Nonetheless, traditional MM compared to effective MT lacks the personalization and moment‐to‐moment adjustments that accompany music therapy in the hands of a seasoned professional. There are adverse effects of music, such as increases in stress that can accompany listening to music that one finds aversive, which music therapists can mitigate. There is a need for a similar approach in MM, especially when limitations make the presence of a music therapist impractical. There is also more work to be done to separate more and less effective MM interventions. Recognizing the need for a better understanding of the role of music in clinical medicine, the NIH has reissued RFA‐AT‐19‐001 (Promoting Research on Music and Health: Phased Innovation Award for Music Interventions (R61/R33, Clinical Trial Optional). This signifies a recognition of the need for a better understanding of music in the clinical setting. One aspect of MBI that has not been extensively investigated in prior studies involving MM is the selection of music patients listen to. Often, patients are not asked regarding their preferred musical genres and the musical taste or opinion of an experimenter or medical provider is used to select the music. Alternatively, the patient is asked to list their music preferences and a single individualized playlist is created, which is time consuming and may induce stress (Stanczyk et al., 2011). There's also evidence that a single playlist, when repeated too many times, can lose its power to reduce stress. Despite the proven effectiveness of music‐induced relaxation, making a music intervention patient‐specific has significant challenges: the cost associated with a professional music therapist or personalized music curator operator dependence, lack of reproducibility, and lack of increasing effectiveness. This leads to MBI not being widely practiced. Rubato Life™ (RL) provides a low cost and effective MBI using a proprietary algorithm for music selection that improves with feedback from a patient's physiological responses. More specifically, machine‐learning and deep neural network learning are applied to select music that is reduces stress as measured by heart rate variability in real time. Additionally, demographic information from prior published studies (Yamasaki et al., 2016) and unpublished work is used to further improve of music selection, and the curation of patient‐specific playlists. This study aims to determine the effect of the RL music selection algorithm on cancer patients' physiological and psychological state during re‐staging appointments. In this change from baseline study design, we will examine the stress and anxiety levels of patients during restaging appointments to determine the ability of RL decrease state anxiety of individual patients undergoing cancer restaging. Further, we will compare this change to that of a group of patients who undergo MBI based on commercially available music selection (chosen by participants) that does not use individual heart rate variability measures in real time. D. Design and Methodology: 1) Study Design 200 adult patients with cancer undergoing restaging will be enrolled. Participants will be recruited during their appointments for cancer restaging The Primary Surgical Attending, will approach the patients at first, and a deeper explanation of the Study will be given to patients by the Study Coordinator. An interim analysis will be performed after the first 30 patients' complete participation Enrolled patients will submit demographic, socioeconomic and medical information, initial music preference, and will complete a standardized stress and anxiety questionnaire to establish baseline stress and anxiety levels. Patients will then be randomized 1:1 into 2 groups: (a) the intervention group in which patients will be asked to listen to a minimum of 45 minutes per day of music for a period of a 2 weeks (or a total of 12 hours) coming up to their scheduled appointment using the RL music selection application while wearing an individual smart bracelet aimed to build their optimal music therapy profile; and (b) the control group in which patients will be asked to listen to a minimum of 45 minutes per day of music (or a total of 12 hours), of their desire, which the participant considers as stress relief music for the same time period. On the day of their restaging appointments, patients from both groups will be asked to complete a baseline STAI‐S stress and anxiety questionnaire followed by either one hour of RL selected music in the intervention group or patient selected music for the control group. At completion of one hour of listening, another STAI‐S will be completed to assess change in stress levels thereby allowing for a change from baseline levels of stress and anxiety. 2) Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion criteria: 1. Aged 18 or older 2. Diagnosed with cancer, requiring restaging imaging between September 2022 and May 2023, 3. Have access to a smartphone and able to operate smartphone 4. Have a Google or Apple ID. Exclusion criteria: 1. Participants with hearing disorders who do not use hearing aids 2. Participants who have extreme dislike of music. 3. Participants who cannot comply with the minimum time Rubato Life application requires to be used No subjects in this study require special consideration 3) Description of Study Treatments or Exposures Participants will be randomly assigned (1:1) to be in either the Intervention or Control group. The Intervention group will be given a smartwatch, the Rubato Life App downloaded to their smartphone, and a Spotify acocunt. The Control group will be given a Spotify account. Participants in both groups will be asked to listen to at least 45 minutes of music per day (or a total of 12 hours) for 2 weeks prior to their restaging visit. Music for the Control group will be participant‐selected, at their leisure. Music for the Intervention group will be a personalized playlist distributed to the participant through the Rubato Life application. All participants will be asked to listen to music for one hour immediately following the restaging appointment. 4) Definition of Primary and Secondary Outcomes/Endpoints Primary outcome: Anxiety, as measured through the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory, State component (STAI‐S). Participants will be asked to complete the STAI‐S prior to randomization, the day of their restaging appointment, and one hour after their restaging appointment. 5) Data Collection Methods, Assessments, Interventions and Schedule Demographic questionnaire: A questionnaire for recording participants' age, race, patient race, age, sex, income (range options), insurance status, music background, English proficiency (range options), medications. Brief Music Experience Questionnaire (BMEQ): A validated questionnaire to assess general music preferences (Werner et al., 2006). State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory‐ State (STAI‐S): A standardized 20‐item assessment of state‐level (momentary, situational) anxiety (Spielberger et al., 1999). Example items include "I am tense", "I am worried" and "I feel calm", "I feel secure". STAI has an internal consistency ranging between 0.86 ‐0.95 and test‐retest reliability from 0.65‐0.75. 6) Confidentiality: Participant privacy and confidentiality will be maintained by coding all data upon enrollment. The research data will be destroyed in 5 years. 7) Adverse Event Criteria and Reporting Procedures: There are not adverse event considered in listenint to music. 8) Study Timeline: Rolling recruitment will take place upon study approval and will continue until 200 participants are enrolled. E. Risks and Discomforts: Participants may feel uncomfortable will answering certain questions about their current anxiety. Participants may experience discomfort from wearing a smartwatch. To minimize effects of risks, participants may skip questions that make them feel uncomfortable. Participants may contact study coordinator if discomfort arises from wearing smartwatch and measures to reduce discomfort will be taken, such as loosening the watch. Participants will be asked to report any other anxiety provoking events that happened/happening during the study period. Participants may discontinue participation at any time. F. Potential Benefits: There are no direct benefits to participants for participating in this study. Participation in this study may benefit society by helping scientists understand how music impacts anxiety associated with cancer restaging. The benefits to society outweigh potential risks associated with this study. G. Data Management, Recordkeeping and Analysis 1. Data Management Methods: Data will be managed by the study coordinator, using Flask Data Manager, which is an electronic recordkeeping program. The data will be coded upon enrollment and connections from codes to identifiers will be stored in a password protected file separate from the data. Data monitoring will be performed by the study coordinator and the PI. 2. Quality Control Methods: Only previously‐validated assessments are used in this study, which have high reliability and validity. All study members will be trained on appropriate study protocols and responsible conduct of research. Study progress will be monitored after collection of 30 participants with an interim analysis. 3. Data Analysis Plan: Categorical variables will be compared using the Chi‐square test. Continuous variables will be compared using the Mann‐Whitney U test and expressed as median values (range), with scores grouped into 10‐point ranges (0‐9, 10‐19, 20‐29, etc). Data will be analyzed after collection of 30 participants and at the conclusion of the study, after all participant data has been collected. 4. Statistical Power and Sample Considerations: The sample size will be set at a significance level of 0.05, power of 0.80, with a proportion of subjects from each group of 0.5 with and Standardized effect size of 0.400. Total sample size will be of 200 subjects, 100 in the Intervention group, and 100 in the control group. H. Study Organization: This study will be overseen by Dr. Conrad, while daily research activities will be completed primarily by the Study Coordinator.

N2  -  Background: A strategy for maintaining and/or improving cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in the growing population of cancer survivors is of major clinical importance in the COVID‐19 era. With the aim of increasing CRF, recent studies have focused on the use of high‐intensity interval training (HIIT) in supervised experimental settings, which appeared to be more beneficial than usual care in cancer survivors at all stages of treatment and aftercare. However, the effect of unsupervised HIIT on increasing CRF in breast cancer survivors is not known. Purpose: To determine whether the newly developed habit‐B program, which involves home‐based smartphone‐supported HIIT using body‐weight exercises, improves CRF in early‐stage breast cancer survivors. We hypothesized that the habit‐B program would improve VO2peak compared with a control group. Methods: This single‐center, 12‐week, parallel‐group, single‐blind, randomized controlled trial involved 50 women with stage I‐IIa breast cancer, aged 20 to 59 years, who had completed initial treatment except for hormone therapy. Participants wore a smartwatch and were randomized to either the exercise or control group from May 27, 2019 through November 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 60 Spatients to detect the increase of 2.0 ml/kg/min change in VO2peak with a standard deviation of 2.6 ml/kg/min, one‐sided significance level of 2.5% and 80% power. The exercise group underwent home‐based HIIT using a smartphone and a Fitbit Versa thrice weekly for 12 weeks (three times per week). The primary outcome was the 12‐week change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak; mL/kg/min) between the groups. Other outcomes included muscle strength, 6‐min walk test, resting heart rate, physical activity, fatigue, safety, and quality of life. Results: Of the 50 participants, 44 (exercise group, n=23; control group, n=21) completed the CRF assessment and 6 did not because of issues related to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The change in VO2peak increased significantly in the exercise group (0.9 [95%CI, 0.1 to 1.7]) compared with the control group (‐0.8 [95%CI,‐1.5 to‐0.1]) (mean difference, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.7 to 2.7], p <.01). Leg strength also increased significantly in the exercise group compared with the control group (mean difference, 13.5 [95% CI, 2.9 to 24.1], p <.01). Changes in other outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: A home‐based HIIT intervention can lead to improved cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength in early‐stage breast cancer survivors; however, a multicenter pragmatic clinical trial is required to confirm the benefits of the habit‐B program.

N2  -  This is a randomized study comparing outcomes of usual care patients diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) with patients diagnosed with T2D enrolled onto Twin Health's TPT system. Twin Precision Treatment (TPT) system utilizes live, exercise and nutrition coaching based on computer algorithm learning to attempt to improve patients overall health and reverse type 2 diabetes (T2D). The TPT system does so by measuring and addressing glucose aberrations associated with meals. Using Whole Body Digital Twin (WBDT) platform powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, the Whole Body Digital Twin platform captures data on up to 174 health markers, up to 3000 daily data points to provide precision nutrition guidance to the patient that precisely balances 87 essential nutrient factors. The platform captures daily weight using Bluetooth scales and captures daily blood pressure, particularly in patients with underlying HTN using Bluetooth blood pressure measurement. Additionally, the Whole Body Digital Twin platform captures daily physical activity and sleep data, and provides precision guidance on activity and sleep for the patient to follow. The machine learning algorithm is devised to integrate these multi‐dimensional data and accurately predict personalized glucose responses. Dietary intake is a central determinant of blood glucose levels, and thus, to achieve optimal glucose levels, it is imperative to make food choices that induce normal postprandial glycemic responses. Thus, the platform will suggest the right food to the right participant at the right time. Depending on the likes and dislikes of the patient, the Whole Body Digital Twin platform will recommend a meal plan that is balanced across macro, micro and biota nutrients to reduce glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, which helps in ameliorating inflammation, fatty liver and insulin resistance. This precise management of nutrition, activity and sleep ensures that the average blood glucose of the day will be consistently maintained within the optimal range. The intervention will continuously offer precision nutrition, precision sleep and precision activity recommendations. Nutritional, activity, and sleep counseling will be provided by trained health coaches through the app and via telephone. In the usual care of type 2 diabetes, glucose‐lowering medications are added progressively with lifestyle modification to improve glycemia and optimize glycated hemoglobin values (HbA1c) so as to reduce the risk of developing long‐term complications. Standard of care is to take such a glucose‐centric approach to T2D management rather than focusing treatment on the underlying root causes of the disease. It is rare to attempt to target remission of the diabetes process since remission occurs in usual care regimens in only a very small percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes (21). Studies that target other metabolic disease states, such as obesity, have been proven to also impact T2D progression and achieve remission states, but these types of approaches are rare in the usual care setting (22). Only three therapeutic approaches have been associated with remission of diabetes: 1. Bariatric surgery, 2. Very Low‐Calorie diet, and 3. Ketogenic diet with near elimination of carbohydrate (23). Our study attempts to determine if precision nutritional, activity and sleep guidance associated with the Whole Body Digital Twin (WBDT) platform and Twin Precision Treatment (TPT) can lead to diabetes remission in a population of patients with T2D.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Wearable devices based on inertial measurement units through wireless sensor networks have many applications such as real‐time motion monitoring and functional outcome assessment of stroke rehabilitation. However, additional investigations are warranted to validate their clinical value, particularly in detecting the synergy patterns of movements after stroke. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and efficacy of wearable devices for upper limb rehabilitation in patients with chronic stroke and to compare the intervention effects (e.g., neurological recovery, active range of motion, and deviation angle) with those in a control group. DESIGN: A single‐blind, randomized‐controlled pilot study. SETTING: Rehabilitation ward. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with chronic stroke were randomly distributed into a device group and control group. Both groups received conventional rehabilitation; nevertheless, the device group was additionally subjected to 15 daily sessions at least three times a week for 5 weeks. The outcome measures included the upper extremity subscores of the Fugl‐Meyer assessment, active range of motion, and deviation angle. These measurements were performed pre‐ and post‐treatment. RESULTS: All five Fugl‐Meyer assessment subscores improved in both the device and control groups after intervention; in particular, the "shoulder/elbow/forearm" subscore (P=0.02, 0.03) and "total score" (P=0.03, 0.03) substantially improved. The active range of motion of shoulder flexion and abduction substantially improved at pre‐post treatment in both the device (P=0.02, 0.03) and control (P=0.02, 0.03) groups. The deviation angle of shoulder external rotation during shoulder abduction substantially improved in the device group (P=0.02), but not in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The designed wearable devices are practical and efficient for use in chronic patients with stroke. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Wearable devices are expected to be useful for future internet‐of‐things rehabilitation clinical trials at home and in long‐term care institutions.

N2  -  Background: Older patients with frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiological reserve, are at risk for adverse outcomes. Physical activity can improve function in cardiovascular patients, but many are unable to attend cardiac rehab. Methods: The Get Going trial is an ongoing multicenter clinical trial of older patients meeting criteria on the FRAIL questionnaire with heart failure (HF) or coronary artery disease (CAD) randomized at hospital discharge to goal‐oriented vs. monitor‐only wearable actigraphy devices. Differences in baseline characteristics, short physical performance battery (SPPB; 0‐12) and EuroQOL 5‐D (0‐5) were compared across diagnosis group. Results: Of 58 participants randomized (21 CAD; 37 HF), median age was 74, 75% male, with a mean SPPB score of 7.5 (±3.4). Patients with HF had more atrial fibrillation (p=0.01), pacemakers (p=0.04), chronic kidney disease (p=0.02), pulmonary hypertension (p=0.01), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.04), but there were no difference in baseline frailty, quality of life, SPPB scores or physical tests between groups (Table). Conclusion: Older adults hospitalized for CAD or HF had similar functional impairments, supporting inclusion of both for interventions aimed at improving post‐discharge care. Ongoing follow up will inform the utility of actigraphy for improving function in these at risk patients.

KW  -  Metabolic Syndrome
N2  -  Achieving optimal metabolic health and glycemic control is a common goal among not only diabetics, but also for healthy individuals, athletes, elite military operators and for infectious disease prevention and resilience. No isolated biomarker is currently ubiquitously accepted as a marker of overall metabolic health and most rely on isolated snapshot (single time point) analyses and not a continuous closed‐loop biomarker data assessment. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c) provides limited characterization of glycemic variability, which contributes to the progression of glycemic dysregulation. For example, emerging evidence links the amplitude and duration of glycemic variability as an independent risk factor linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1, 2). Hyperglycemia‐induced endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress are greater with larger glycemic variability (2, 3). Glycemic variability is more deleterious for the cardiovascular system than sustained hyperglycemia (4). Few technologies allow for continuous biomarker monitoring over time, and under a range of conditions like daily activities, swimming, exercise, sleep, etc. Multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest the predictive impact and value of monitoring glycemic variability on acute and chronic health of diabetes populations and non‐diabetes populations [5, 6]. Thus, there has been emerging interest in therapeutic approaches that seek to reduce glycemic variability. This potential for early detection of glycemic dysregulation is likely to be the single most beneficial effect of using CGM as an informational device, especially in the context of other biomarkers measures periodically. It is likely that people will make lifestyle modifications if they are aware of an impending health problem, detected through real time GCM‐tracked glycemic variability. Lifestyle modifications are proven to be the most effective intervention for restoring normal fasting glucose levels and preventing diabetes among dysglycemic subjects, reducing the conversion to diabetes by 58% over placebo, and by 39% over metformin in one large US study [7]. Long terms follow‐ups on other international studies have shown equally significant results at 4 years [8] and 14 years [9] after the controlled lifestyle interventions ended, including reductions in diabetes incidence of 58%, and 43% respectively. It is known that metabolic health is on a spectrum and long‐term studies in diabetic populations have demonstrated that reducing glycemic variability is more important than lowering baseline hyperglycemia in terms of reducing cardiovascular complications [10]. Therefore, there exists a scientific rationale to study interventions that can optimize metabolic health in non‐diabetics since the potential benefits of metabolic awareness extend beyond the diabetic population. Emerging technology that can provide tight feedback on lifestyle effects could be a valuable mechanism for non‐diabetics seeking to improve education and reduce their lifetime risk of disease. Though such outcomes have not yet been demonstrated in long term studies, the existing research reveals promising results, including improved screening for metabolic risk [5], clear observability of effects of lifestyle intervention [10, 11, 12], and acceptance of a minimal‐risk strategy for use as a preventative tool in a non‐diabetic population [13]. The Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group called for a shift in response in order to reverse these trends, stating that: "methods of treating diabetes remain inadequate and that prevention is preferable [7]." Though unproven as a preventative measure, monitoring of glycemic variability is ‐ at worst ‐ unlikely to exacerbate the problem. At best, however, if it becomes a widespread lifestyle tool, the benefits of improved individual metabolic awareness and educated action could have compounding effects at a larger societal scale. Therefore, there exists a scientific rationale to study interventions that can optimize metabolic health with improved glycemic monitoring technologies [14]. It is becoming clear, that in addition to diabetic populations, normal, healthy populations can benefit from stable, controlled blood sugar levels, and that feedback mechanisms, including wearable technologies, can be employed. Thus, CGM could be a promising method of improving biomarkers of metabolic health for virtually anyone. In addition, optimal metabolic health is typically associated with improved behavioral health and cognitive resilience and decision making [15]. Thus, optimizing and monitoring glycemic control may be useful for mental health and may be a valuable tool for military personnel and first responders under metabolic stress. Advances in software and hardware technologies have been developed to measure, analyze and predict glycemic variability and provides insight on how this dynamic biomarker correlates to metabolic fitness. Specifically, new advances in CGM technologies offer the potential to monitor, predict and change behavior through a closed‐loop feedback system. By comparing CGM data with blood markers of metabolic health (eg.HbA1c , Insulin, etc.), and inflammation (e.g. hsCRP, cytokines) and along with assessments of emotion, cognition and behavior, a more robust interpretation and deconvolution of CGM data with experimental interventions may be possible.

N2  -  Background: Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with an increased risk of complications for patients with AF. The impact of diabetes on post‐operative AF after cardiac surgery is not well‐defined. Methods and Results: We sought to characterize the effect of diabetes, insulin, and oral hypoglycemic agents on the incidence of post‐operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery. We performed a sub‐analysis from the Post‐Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH‐AF) CardioLink‐1 randomized trial (NCT02793895). It randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched‐based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12‐lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. We examined the association between: (i) diabetes and risk of POAF and (ii) glucose‐lowering therapy among patients with diabetes and risk of POAF. Of the 176 (52%) patients with diabetes in the study cohort, 80 (45%) patients were treated with at least 1 oral hypoglycemic agent and 44 (25%) patients were treated with insulin. The incidence of POAF occurring within 30 days after discharge from surgery was similar between patients with or without diabetes (cumulative incidence: 10.8% vs. 10.0%, log‐rank p=0.77). Among patients with diabetes, the incidence of POAF was highest in those who were not treated with glucose‐lowering therapy (17.3%), followed by those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (10.0%) and insulin (4.5%) (log‐rank p=0.045 for trend). A trend suggesting a lower incidence of POAF was observed among cardiac surgical patients who were treated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors (log‐rank p=0.084 for trend). Conclusion: Even among patients with little to no POAF immediately after cardiac surgery, the risk of POAF within 30 days after discharge is high. Among patients with diabetes, oral anticoagulation should be considered as per current guidelines. There are possible associations between specific glucose‐lowering therapies and risk of POAF after cardiac surgery, meriting further investigations. [Formula presented]

N2  -  INTERVENTION: The study is interventional. It is an individually randomised single‐blind multi‐site randomised controlled trial. Participant's will be individually randomised using a web‐based system (sealed envelope) with randomisation blocked and stratified by site. Participants will be randomised after baseline interviews in a ratio of 1:1 to the APPLE‐Tree intervention versus control. The control group receives usual care plus written information about dementia prevention, including the behavioural change targets, with signposting information. Study participants will not be blind to treatment allocation. The researcher delivering the intervention will be different from the researcher conducting the follow‐up assessments for each participant to enable masking of Research assistants during outcome assessments. An intervention will be created that targets key risk factors in older people at high dementia risk: cardiometabolic dysfunction (diabetes and cardiovascular risks), physical inactivity, social isolation, mental illness, alcohol and smoking. This is to find out whether a lower intensity, personally tailored intervention that targets older people with subjective memory decline, is flexible in delivery format (with individual sessions for those unable or unwilling to attend groups) and informed by best available behaviour change techniques, can effectively reduce cognitive decline. The programme will be 10 group sessions over six months. Individual sessions will be offered for people who cannot come to groups. Two facilitators will lead the groups. They will be trained and supervised by an experienced psychologist to keep to a manual so the programme is delivered in the same way each time. Groups will take place in a range of places to be accessible to all. People taking part will be asked to complete questionnaires, including a memory test and give a voluntary blood sample, before the programme starts and 6 and 24 months CONDITION: Older adults at high dementia risk with ; Mental and Behavioural Disorders ; Mild Cognitive Impairment, Subjective Cognitive Decline PRIMARY OUTCOME: Cognition, using the modified Neuropsychological Test Battery (mNTB) composite z score at baseline, 12 months and 24 months INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Age 60+ 2. Cognitive Change Index score>16 indicating subjective cognitive impairment 3. Quick MCI score within educational and age normal range for MCI or SCD; CAIDE Dementia Risk Score =6 points (modifiable risk factors) 4. No dementia diagnosis 5. Functional Assessment Questionnaire score <9 (no significant impairment) 6. A relative, friend or professional in at least monthly contact who is able and willing to act as an informant SECONDARY OUTCOME: ; At baseline, 12 months and 24 months:; 1. Health and social care costs, measured using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI); 2. Quality of life, measured using the EQ‐5D‐5L; 3. Functional Assessment Questionnaire, to measure activities of daily living; 4. Neuropsychiatric Inventory to measure neuropsychiatric symptoms will be completed with an informant; 5. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; 6. Measures of behaviour change:; 6.1. Mediterranean Diet Score: to assess consumption of Mediterranean diet elements; e.g., olive oil, wine, fruits, legumes and whole‐grain intake. Low consumption of meat, coffee, commercial sweets and fizzy drinks is reverse scored. Higher scores indicate greater dietary adherence; 6.2. AUDIT (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Tool); 6.3. Smoking status; 6.4. Measures of primary support‐network size, life events and the revised UCLA loneliness scale; 7. Mobility limitations and physical functioning using the Short Physical Performance Battery (standing balance test, timed sit‐to stand test, 4‐m comfortable walking time); and blood pressure, weight and Body Mass Index (BMI), and hip and waist circumference; 8. Physical activity over one week (after baseline assessment), using wearable sensors; and download cognitive training use from the website.; 9. Blood indices: red blood cell fatty acid and vitamin C to evaluate dietary compliance. We will measure cardiovascular and cognitive biomarkers of risk including plasma total, LDL and HDL‐cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, HBA1c, BDNF (marker of neuronal function) and insulin. The Global Screening Array (Illumina) will be used to generate genome‐wide genotype data for each participant and derive Alzheimerâ€™s disease polygenic risk scores;

N2  -  Background Long‐term adherence to exercise is often poor for people with coronary heart disease (CHD) who have completed supervised, centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation. Wearable activity devices with personalised feedback may remotely support people with CHD to maintain their exercise achieved during cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Aim The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a remotely prescribed, delivered and monitored CR intervention using a wearable device to support long‐term adherence to exercise and physical activity during maintenance cardiac rehabilitation. Methods After completing and being discharged from phase III CR , 30 participants with CHD, will be randomised (1:1) to an intervention (n=15) or a usual care group (n=15) in a 12‐ month feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT). The intervention will comprise of an exercise consultation, personalised exercise prescription delivered via a wearable activity monitor using biometric feedback, regular monitoring via check‐ins at one, three and six‐months, and feedback text‐messages for sixmonths. Participants will be assessed at baseline (following completion of CR) and at three‐, six‐, and 12‐months postrandomisation. The primary outcome will be feasibility, including assessment of eligibility, recruitment, adherence, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes will include exercise capacity, physical activity behaviours, 10‐year risk for recurrent vascular events using the SMART risk score and quality of life. Semi‐structured interviews will be conducted at three‐, six‐, and 12‐months post randomisation (and with those who drop‐out) to explore the acceptability of the study intervention and procedures. A questionnaire will be offered to those who decline participation. Conclusion The MAINTAIN study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a future definitive multi‐centre RCT testing a remotely prescribed and monitored long‐term maintenance exercise programme using a wearable activity device, versus usual care, for people with CHD who have completed supervised CR.

N2  -  Aims: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) causes high mortality and substantial societal burdens for healthcare systems (HSs). The risk of SCD is significantly increased in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction after myocardial infarction (MI). Current guidelines recommend re‐evaluation of cardioverter‐defibrillator implantation 40 days post‐MI, earliest. Medical therapy alone does not provide sufficient protection against SCD, especially in the first month post‐MI, and needs time. Consequently, there is a gap in care of high‐risk patients upon hospital discharge. The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is a proven safe, effective therapy, which temporarily protects from SCD. Little information on WCD cost‐effectiveness exists. We conducted this research to demonstrate the medical need of the device in the post‐MI setting defining WCD cost‐effectiveness. Methods & results: Based on a randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and Italian and international data, we developed a Markov‐model comparing costs, patient survival, and quality‐of‐life, and calculated the Incremental Cost‐Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) of a WCD vs. current standard of care in post‐MI patients. The rather conservative base case analysis – based on the RCT intention‐to‐treat results ‐ produced an ICER of €47,709 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained, which is far lower than the accepted threshold of €60,000 in the Italian National HS. The ICER per Life Year (LY) gained was €38,276. Conclusion: WCD utilization in post‐MI patients is clinically beneficial and cost‐effective. While improving guideline directed patient care, the WCD can also contribute to a more efficient use of resources in the Italian HS, and potentially other HSs as well.

Groups will be between 2‐5 participants. This is aimed at educating them about Personal Activity Intelligence (PAI) and their physical activity goals. At the first session participants will be given a fitness wristband to keep. This measures heart rate when exercising to calculate PAI points. The device is called AMAZFIT GTS wristband. It uses an LED light to illuminate the capillaries around the participants wrist, tracking the velocity of the blood flow and thus, heart rate. Physical Activity Intelligence (PAI) is calculated by an algorithm in the device that uses the participant s heart rate, awarding them with a number of PAI depending on the intensity of the exercise with the goal of reaching 100 PAI per week. Each session will consist of activities that will include: • PAI‐learning • PAI‐playtime • Behaviour Change Counselling and Interpretive assistance PAI‐learning‐ This is designed to learn how to use the PAI app on their smartphone, how to activate heart rate recording, how to connect with PAI‐buddies and how to troubleshoot problems. PAI‐playtime‐ During this activity an accredited exercise physiologist (AEP) will guide participants through different types of exercise (for short bouts of 5‐10 minutes) at different intensities to see the different ways PAI can be obtained. This will demonstrate different ways to ‘earn’ PAI and include instruction CONDITION: Cardiovascular ‐ Coronary heart disease Cardiovascular ‐ Other cardiovascular diseases Cardiovascular disease;Myocardial Infarction;Coronary artery bypass graft;valvular disease;valve surgery;medically stable angina;Valve surgery;Stent insertion; ; Cardiovascular disease ; Myocardial Infarction ; Coronary artery bypass graft ; valvular disease ; valve surgery ; medically stable angina ; Valve surgery ; Stent insertion PRIMARY OUTCOME: Number of days reaching 100 PAI. To determine the number of days a participant has 100 PAI, data will be obtained from the PAI server. [Daily from week 2 to week 12 post‐intervention commencement with day 7 of week 12 being the primary endpoint.] Number of days reaching 50 PAI. To determine the number of days a participant has 50 PAI, data will be obtained from the PAI server. [Daily from week 2 to week 12 post‐intervention commencement with day 7 of week 12 being the primary endpoint] Number of days reaching 75 PAI. To determine the number of days a participant has 75 PAI, data will be obtained from the PAI server. [Daily from week 2 to week 12 post‐intervention commencement with day 7 of week 12 being the primary endpoint] ; ; On the first study visit (Visit 1), a familiarisation (i.e. practice) CPET will be conducted to get the participant familiar with the set up and process of the maximal fitness test. Participants will complete the warm up and stage 1 only. This increases the robustness of the maximal CPET in the final assessment visit (Visit 3). ; immediately distal to the elbow joint (>220mmHg). Using edge detection software, FMD will be calculated as peak diameter – baseline diameter/baseline diameter and expressed as % change. ; Cardiac rehabilitation participants may have suffered a myocardial infarction, undergone coronary artery bypass surgery, valvular surgery and/or stent insertion. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Australian and New Zealand 5 year and 10 year Cardiovascular Risk Calculator‐ composite outcome[Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Body Weight: Avery Weigh‐Tronix AWB 120 Bench scales will be used and weight will be recoded in kilograms. [Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in Aortic stiffness: will be measured using the pulse wave velocity (PWV) technique with a SphygmoCor XCEL automated blood pressure device (AtCor Medical, West Ryde, NSW, Australia) while participants lie in a supine position. To assess PWV, pulse waves will be monitored at the carotid artery (neck) by a hand‐held tonometer, and simultaneously pulse waves will be monitored at the femoral artery using a low pressure pneumatic thigh cuff which will remain partially inflated over a period of 20‐60 seconds. This procedure does not cause any discomfort. PWV is determined by calculating the ratio of the distance between the carotid and femoral arteries to the transit time; measured as the time delay between the arrival of the pulse wave at the common carotid artery and the common femoral artery.[At baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in Augmentation Index (AIx): Brachial artery blood pressure will be measured using the automated device. Following BP measurement, the arm cuff is inflated to a light pressure just above diastolic pressure for 10 seconds. During this time pressure waves are sampled for the measurement of AIx. The central aortic pulse wave will be used to determine the ratio of wave reflection amplitude to central pulse pressure. This procedure causes no discomfort and is similar to a standard blood pressure measurement.[Baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Change in blood measures‐ fasting samples will be analysed for a composite of cardiometabolic risk: lipid profiles, glucose and insulin by a NATA accredited laboratory (QML). The lipid profile from plasma will include assessment of total cholesterol (TC), very low‐density lipoprotein (VLDL), low‐density lipoprotein (LDL), high‐density lipoprotein (HDL), high‐sensitive C‐ reactive protein (hsCRP) and triglycerides (TG). From these, the very low‐density lipoprotein and cholesterol to HDL ratio will be calculated.[Baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Change in body composition: Dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic Horizon A) will be used to determine body composition (this includes a composite of total bodyweight, total body lean tissue mass, total body fat mass, total body fat percentage). All measures will be quantified and analysed as per manufacturer instruction. While we expect the mean age of participants to be ; THIS IS A PRIMARY OUTCOME[Daily from week 2 to week 12 post‐intervention commencement with day 7 of week 12 being the primary endpoint. ] Waist circumference: waist circumference will be measured against the skin (no shirt/material between the tape and the skin) to the nearest 0.1 cm using a metal retractable tape (Fibreglass measuring tape, Guilick II, Country Technology Inc. Wisconsin USA). Waist circumference will be measured at the midpoint between the lowest rib and the iliac crest; location of measurement will be identified by palpation of the bony landmarks, then using the tape measure to locate the midpoint between the two landmarks. All measures will be taken in triplicate. [Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] 50‐60years (based off previous research experience) our inclusion criteria is 18‐79 years. Initial screening will include a question regarding intention to become pregnant and those who are intending will be excluded. As the dose of radiation associated with DXA is very low dose (<0.1mSv) we will not give recognised pregnancy tests.[ Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Change in Body Mass Index (BMI), BMI will be calculated by taking a height measurement (Stature will be measured by stadiometer in centimeters) and weight measurement (Avery Weigh‐Tronix AWB 120 Bench scales will be used and weight will be recoded in kilograms). These height and weight measurements will be used to calculate BMI using the formula BMI = kg/m2. [At baseline and completion of the trial Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Change in Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2peak) using a graded treadmill exercise test to volitional exhaustion. Cardiorespiratory fitness (VO2max) will be assessed via a maximal stress test using a ramp exercise protocol with simultaneous electrocardiogram analysis, under the supervision of the study physician if indicated. Treadmill will be the preferable mode for the test, however an exercise bike will be available for participants with walking limitations. Prior to the test, participants will be asked to avoid exercise, caffeine and tobacco for 24h, and food for 2h. On arrival, participants will rest, seated, for ten minutes, before having two measures of blood pressure taken from the left arm, two minutes apart. A 3‐minute rest period will follow, allowing for the measurement of resting pulmonary gas exchange. Treadmill testing will commence with a 4‐minute warm‐up at 4 km/h and 0% gradient before continuing exercise for a further 4 minutes at a 4% gradient at the same speed. Following the warm‐up, participants will perform exercise in continuous 1‐minute stages. The speed will increase by 1km/hr every three minutes, the gradient will increase by 1% each minute, until volitional fatigue. For the bike, warm‐up will involve participants cycling at a workload corresponding to an RPE 10 at an RPM above 60 for 4 minutes before the intensity is increased by 25‐50 watts for a further 4 minutes. Following warm‐up, the intensity will be increased by 25 watts each minute until volitional fatigue. Verbal encouragement will be given throughout the test. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Defence Force or Ex serving personnel and/or immediate family (spouse and/or first degree relative) that has completed a cardiac rehabilitation programme within the last 12 months. ; Pulmonary gas exchange will be measured using either the Parvo (Parvo Medics TrueOne, Sandy, Utah, USA) or Metamax (Metamax II system, Cortex, Leipzig, Germany) metabolic systems from the start of the rest period, until cessation of the test. The metabolic system and test protocol for a participant, at each assessment, will be identical. Standard calibration procedures according to manufacturer’s instructions will be completed before each exercise test and involve the gas analysers (two‐point calibration of known gas concentrations) and volume (Hans RudolphTM 3L calibration syringe). O2, carbon dioxide production ( CO2) and minute ventilation ( E), sampled using ten‐second rolling averages, will be recorded throughout the test and stored for later analysis. Simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording (CASE Exercise Testing System, Milwaukee, WI, USA) and analysis will also take place during the test. Recording of the heart rate will occur at regular intervals including before the test, every minute during warm‐up, and at the end of each minute during the exercise test. Heart rate recovery will also be assessed by recording heart rate at cessation and at 1‐, 2‐, 3‐, and 5‐minutes post‐exercise. Blood pressure will be measured at rest and every 3‐minutes from the beginning of warm‐ up, as well as 1‐minute, 3‐minutes, and 5‐minutes post‐test. RPE will be monitored at the end of each warm‐up stage, every minute during the exercise test, and at cessation. ; This is a description of the outcome measure (Cardiorespiratory fitness) protocol and is composite of Pulmonary exchange. ECG, RPE and blood pressure). [Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement)] Change in Central blood pressure and wave reflection characteristics: Brachial artery waveforms will be recorded from the right upper arm using the Sphygmocor Xcel (AtCor Medical) following standard guidelines. Pressures that will be measured are: central systolic, central diastolic, central pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure, augmentation pressure, and augmentation index. Wave separation analysis will estimate the aortic pressure wave. The forward (Pf) and reflected (Pb) pressure waves correspond to the peak and the end of the assumed flow wave, respectively. The reflection magnitude (RM) is calculated as the ratio of the Pb to the Pf (RM = Pb/Pf ×100).[Baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in dietary Intake: Participants will complete a 3‐day food diary, using the research‐version of the Easy Diet Diary App (https://easydietdiary.com/). Dietary data will be extracted from this application and input into FoodworksTM, providing information on food group serves. Participants will have the option of completing their 3 day food record manually (paper based) if preferred.[Baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Change in exercise capacity. The Six‐Minute Walk Test (6MWT) will be utilised to give an indication of exercise capacity, conducted according to standardised procedures. The 6MWT measures the distance the participant can quickly walk in 6 minutes, while self‐pacing and resting as needed. It involves the assessor laying out a 30 metre track, with increments every metre. Baseline heart rate (bpm) and blood pressure will be taken from participants in a seated position before starting the test. Participants will be asked to complete as many laps as possible during the 6 minute period. The assessor will keep a tally of completed laps throughout, and instruct participants using a standardised script. Post‐test, participants will have RPE, blood pressure and heart rate recorded again in a seated position. The result of the 6MWT will be distance walked rounded to the nearest metre.[Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Change in perceived wellbeing, and health related variables: ; SF‐36 measures physical and mental health based on 8 health concepts: physical and social functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health perception[Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in physical activity levels will be quantified via an activity log given to participants that is specifically designed for this trial. [Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in physical activity levels will be quantified via an Actigraph accelerometer, worn for 7 consecutive days.[At baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in Physical Activity levels: The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ‐ short form), will be administered to identify potentially eligible volunteers who are meeting physical activity guidelines. IPAQ was developed to establish a standardized and culturally adaptable measurement tool for measuring physical activity in different cultures of the world. [Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement)..] Change in resting heart rate. For resting heart rate the radial pulse will be palpated and recorded for 60 s. Two measures will be recorded and if there is a difference >10 beats per minute record a third measurement.[ Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg, in triplicate): Blood pressure will be taken with a manual cuff after 10‐15 minutes of quiet, relaxed sitting. Participants will be asked to keep breathing normally and refrain from talking during the procedure. Blood pressure will be checked in both arms at the first examination. When there is a consistent inter‐arm difference, the arm with the higher pressure should be used. The second measure should be taken on the alternate arm. If there is >10 mmHg difference between measures, a third measure should be taken on the arm with the higher reading. For resting heart rate the radial pulse will be palpated and recorded for 60 s. Two measures will be recorded and if there is a difference >10 beats per minute record a third measurement. [Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in The Framingham Risk Score [Baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Change in Vascular function will be assessed via brachial artery flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in accordance with published guidelines. Using a high‐resolution duplex ultrasound machine (model T3000, Terason, Burlington, MA), we will image the brachial artery for simultaneous recording of brachial diameter and blood velocity before and after a 5‐min ischaemic stimulus, using a forearm cuff (Figure 3). Diameter and flow will be assessed at rest (1 minute) and for 3 minutes following a 5 minute period of forearm occlusion (ischemia) using a pneumatic cuff placed ; [At baseline and on completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Changes in scores from Psychological Well being Index which assesses psychological distress across dimensions of:(i) anxiety, (ii) depressed mood, (iii) positive well‐being, (iv) self‐control, (v) general health, and (vi) vitality. [Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Feedback on participant experience of the PAI eHealth program and AmazFit smartwatch will also be obtained from the intervention group via survey which is readily designed for this study and one‐on‐one interviews. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim with use of Otter Software (that records voice as text). All text will be reviewed and compared against the original recording with manual edits made where necessary. Participants will be provided with the opportunity to review their transcripts, to ensure their responses and views are conveyed to their satisfaction. Intervention participants will be asked to respond to additional items to obtain feedback on using PAI (e.g. comprehension, ease of use, satisfaction). Recordings will be deleted after transcripts are finalised.[On completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement). ] Height: Stature will be measured by stadiometer in centimeters[Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Hip Circumference: Hip circumference will be taken at the greater trochanter. All measures will be taken in triplicate.[Baseline and on completion of trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Number of adverse events. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events. All participants will be asked to record any physical symptoms (e.g., extreme breathlessness, chest pain), musculoskeletal injuries, falls, acute illnesses and changes in health status/meds. These will be recorded in a diary provided to the participants. Bi‐monthly phone calls will be made to all participants to obtain ongoing safety data. [From commencement through to completion of the trial (12 weeks post‐intervention commencement).] Number of days reaching 25 PAI. To determine the number of days a participant has 25 PAI, data will be obtained from the PAI server.

N2  -  Pressure offloading is the lynchpin of neuropathic ulcer care. Multiple methods of statically reducing pressure have been employed, with various degrees of success, in the ulcer care continuum. Traditional offloading interventions redistribute the load on the plantar surface, and include: non‐removable devices (total contact casts, removable walkers rendered non‐removable, and cast shoes), and removable devices (walkers, forefoot offloading shoes, half shoes, bivalve total contact casts, and therapeutic shoes)1,2,3. A Cochrane Review on the use of offloading in the treatment of uncomplicated neuropathic plantar ulcers gives the efficacy of each device type in terms of percentage of ulcers healed and time required for healing4. The total contact cast has been found to be more effective than removable devices in many randomized controlled trials, for both the percentage of neuropathic ulcers healed and the time required for healing5,6,7. Ninety‐two percent of neuropathic ulcers healed in an average of 6 weeks8. Removable walkers made non‐removable may be as effective as total contact casts9,10,11. The effectiveness of forefoot offloading shoes, half‐shoes, and cast shoes in the healing of neuropathic forefoot ulcers needs to be confirmed by prospective trials12. The lower efficacy of prescribed removable devices could be attributable to a lower adherence to recommended use13. The effectiveness of offloading interventions is intimately linked to the skin reperfusion that is seen when persistent external pressure is alleviated. Key modifiable parameters in mitigating tissue damage to the neuropathic foot are pressure and time. Kosiak reported in 1959 that "microscopic pathologic changes were noted in tissues subjected to as little as 60 mmHg for only one hour"14,15. More recently, exposures from 15 min to one hour at pressures greater than 240 mmHg, and from two hours or more at pressures greater than 67 mmHg, were found to cause cell death in rat muscle tissue16. Despite this, there is limited information regarding the efficacy of interventions aimed at preventing pressure ulcers; a comprehensive review of the literature did not find enough evidence to recommend a repositioning frequency17. A consensus document from an international review on pressure ulcer prevention states that "patients confined to wheelchairs should be taught to reposition every 15 minutes"18. While established pressure offloading interventions are able to statically reduce pressure on the active ulcer, they provide no dynamic relief of pressure. Since neuropathy is characterized by a loss of protective sensation (LOPS), the patient is often unaware of sustained pressure on a specific anatomic region over time. Even with static offloading instruments, it is conceivable that critical pressure and time thresholds can be dynamically exceeded without the patient's knowledge or ability to address the problem. Taken together, the literature provides support for the development of a system that monitors pressure over time at key locations, and provides alert‐based feedback to guide as‐needed, patient‐based offloading for use in patients with active ulceration. The proof of concept of the designed platform as a supplement in the management of the diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) will be assessed in the context of a randomized clinical trial (RCT) pilot. Our hypotheses are that the proposed technology will: 1. Accelerate the wound healing process (i.e. success of complete wound healing within 16 weeks, time to heal, rate of wound size change, and complication rate); 2. Improve adherence with RCW use (measured in hours of use per day); and 3. Improve offloading (i.e. in terms of pressure‐time intervals). 4. Upon wound closure, prevent the incidence of plantar ulcer recurrence. The SurroSense Rx system (Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc., Calgary, AB) is a patent pending (US Publication #20120109013 and PCT WO/2012/055029) footwear system designed to aid in the prevention of plantar pressure ulceration and re‐ulceration and the treatment of active ulcers in neuropathic patients. It comprises two pressure‐sensing inserts and a smartwatch display device. The device alerts the user when "safe" pressure and time thresholds have been exceeded; the current thresholds are based on the general clinical understanding of pressure ulcer formation, which indicates that a conservative threshold would be >30‐50mmHg for >15 minutes. For a review of the literature, please refer to Appendix 4. As more plantar pressure and outcome data are collected over time, these thresholds may be modified for future iterations of the product. These thresholds will be kept constant for the duration of the study in question. The device measures plantar pressures at discrete points corresponding to bony prominences that would be considered to be at higher risk for ulceration: the first metatarsal head (1), the lateral metatarsal heads (2), the great toe (1), the lateral toes (1), the lateral foot (2), and the heel (1). These areas were selected based on the inherent high risk of neuropathic ulceration at these anatomic locations. This data is tracked, with analysis being performed on those that have been collected over the last 15 minutes. If > 95% of the measurements taken by a pressure sensor over a 15‐minute scanning window exceed 30‐50 mmHg, an alert is sent to the user via the smartwatch to guide them to appropriately offload that area. Eligible subjects will be randomized to the Experimental Arm, Control Arm A or Control Arm B (25 per arm). The experimental group will be provided with an active (alerting) SurroSense Rx® device fitted into a standardized RCW* (Rebound® Diabetic Walker, Össur, Iceland). Control Group A will be provided with an inactive (non‐alerting) version of the SurroSense Rx® device fitted into a standardized RCW. Control Group B will be provided with an inactive version of the SurroSense Rx® device fitted into a standardized RCW and secured with a device‐specific tie; this will act as an iTCC device for the purposes of this trial. Patients in all arms will be provided with a New Balance 928 shoe to wear on their contralateral foot so as to ensure optimal device performance. All patients will be assessed at baseline and every week until successful wound healing or 16 weeks, whichever comes first. Following wound resolution, patients will be followed with their assigned device, being used in a pair of New Balance 928 shoes to be provided to the patient, for 6 months for ulcer recurrence. After 6 months, the device will be discontinued, at which time the patients will be followed for an additional 12 months for further ulcer recurrence. Should a patient's wound remain unresolved after 16 weeks, they will continue using their assigned device into the subsequent 6‐month period. If wound resolution occurs during this 6‐month period, patients will switch to the New Balance 928 shoes for the remainder of the period; however, if wound resolution does not occur during this time, the patient will be withdrawn from the study prior to the commencement of the subsequent 12‐month observation period. For all research subjects wearing the SurroSense Rx®, the device will measure plantar pressure and adherence to prescribed offloading. All groups will be fit with Jawbone UP Activity Trackers (or an equivalent activity tracker) so as to monitor their activity throughout the study. *The removable Rebound® Diabetic Walker insole is heat‐moldable: it can be heated (3 minutes at 110°C/230°F) and formed to the patients' foot (the patient stands in socks on the heated insole for 1 minute ‐ then the hexagons should be removed as appropriate). This method should improve the weight distribution of the plantar foot and provide better offloading at the ulcer sites, and is recommended for optimal treatment. Primary aims of the study: ‐ This pilot study will investigate the efficacy of the SurroSense Rx® system in expediting the healing of active neuropathic ulcers in terms of rate of wound area reduction. ‐ It will also investigate the system's potential to improve healing rates in the treatment of active neuropathic ulcers using the more practical RCWs. ‐ It will also investigate the system's potential to prevent recurrent ulceration post ulcer resolution. To achieve this, following wound resolution, patients will be followed for 18 months (the first 6 months with their assigned device) to monitor for ulcer recurrence. Secondary aims of the study: ‐ Compare complete wound healing at 16 weeks in the experimental versus control groups ‐ Compare the healing times and rates as a function of the patient's baseline Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) and Modified Neuropathy Disability Score (MNDS)19 in the experimental versus control group ‐ Compare the change in the MNDS over the course of the study ‐ Performance of a cost‐effectiveness analysis of the experimental versus control group's methods of treating diabetic ulcers ‐ Elucidate pressure data and adherence parameters (activity data—including step count and type of activity, peak pressures, number of alerts, measures of central tendency for time to offload, areas of alert generation, hours of use per day) for all patients, and compare those data for patients in the experimental versus control groups ‐ Compare area of ulceration to areas of SurroSense Rx® device alert generation (active devices) or would‐be alert generation (inactive devices) ‐ Compare pressure data and adherence parameters (activity data—including step count and type of activity, peak pressures, number of alerts, measures of central tendency for time to offload, areas of alert generation, hours of use per day) to MNSI and MNDS Scales ‐ Examine the ability of pressure data and adherence parameters to predict healing ‐ Comparison of complication rates in the experimental versus control groups

N2  -  Background: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an increasingly prevalent condition that represents a major national public health burden. The health transition from advanced CKD to the start of dialysis is a period of heightened vulnerability for many patients. Our data has demonstrated that during the 30‐day period before the start of dialysis, there is a 10‐fold increase in Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations related to kidney failure and its complications. Importantly, this spike occurs despite patients having frequent contact with their nephrology healthcare teams. For stable CKD patients, virtual monitoring could facilitate the communication of accurate and reliable data between patients and providers helping to avoid unnecessary ED visits and facilitate more optimal dialysis starts. Design& Method: The VIEWER study is a national, pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial across 6 Canadian sites. VIEWER is a CKD‐specific virtual care platform that integrates data from a wireless Blood Presure (BP) cuff, weight scale, transcutaneous O2 sat monitor, and wearable motion tracker. The patient‐facing component of VIEWER (patient portal), is a custom application based on a mobile tablet that guides patients through a daily self‐assessment routine using the connected devices. BP measurements, weight and oxygenation (as surrogates of volume status), and step counts (as a surrogate of functional status), provide semi‐continuous longitudinal data on patient physical status. Additionally, patients are prompted to fill out a weekly symptom survey (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Score‐ revised; ESAS‐r), a validated instrument of kidney failure symptoms. Patient data and ESAS scores are automatically uploaded to fully PHIA/HIPPA compliant servers where they are made available to the patients' care team through a secure, web‐based provider portal. Provider notifications (flags) are generated for out‐of‐range values (i.e. BP, weights for volume management) and a secure messaging component allows for direct patient‐provider communication. Participants will be trained to use the VIEWER platform by a member of the research team. On the provider side, two members of the care team at each site will be trained as "superusers" of the provider portal. These users will check and respond as needed daily (Monday to Friday) for flags and patient messages, and will respond or communicate as needed to the health care team as per local clinic standard operating procedures. Trends in measurements will be reviewed at multidisciplinary team rounds, which typically occur weekly. During routine clinic visits, trends in all objective and subjective measures will be available to review to inform clinical decision making. Consistent with our pragmatic design, we will not be proscriptive in how monitoring data are interpreted; rather, we ask that care teams consider this enriched data stream and incorporate that information according to their own protocols and clinical judgement. Patients randomized to the control group will see their multidisciplinary CKD care teams as per usual care. Follow‐up visits and Focus Groups: Patient Reported Experience Measures (PREM) and Kidney Disease Quality of Life‐Short Form (KDQOL‐SF) will be measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months in all paticipanats. Usability, acceptability, and patient and provider perspective on the intervention will be assessed at the end of the trial using the System Usability Scale (SUS). In addition, two virtual focus groups will be conducted at the end of the study with a subset of participants and healthcare providers who used the VIEWER platform. Statistical Methods:The primary outcome (time to first hospitalization or ED visit, censoring at dialysis or death) will be assessed using univariate Cox proportional hazards models and a Kaplan‐Meier analysis with a log‐rank test, as will the secondary outcomes of all‐cause mortality, ED visits, hospitalization, and acute inpatient dialysis initiation. Change in overall PREM, KDQOL‐SF and SUS scores will be assessed with two‐sided t‐test or Wilcoxon Rank Sum test as distributionally appropriate, and interpreted relative to their minimal important differences. All outcomes will be assessed at a two‐sided alpha= 0.05. Subgroup analyses will be prespecified and limited to 1) eGFR greater or less than 10ml/min, 2) sex and gender (described below) 3) diabetes.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Intensive lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, but the implementation of learnings from landmark studies is expensive and time consuming. The availability of digital lifestyle interventions is increasing, but evidence of their effectiveness is limited. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to test the feasibility of a web‐based diabetes prevention program (DPP) with step‐dependent feedback messages versus a standard web‐based DPP in people with prediabetes. METHODS: We employed a two‐arm, parallel, single‐blind RCT for people at high risk of developing diabetes. Patients with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 39‐47 mmol/mol were recruited from 21 general practices in London. The intervention integrated a smartphone app delivering a web‐based DPP course with SMS texts incorporating motivational interviewing techniques and step‐dependent feedback messages delivered via a wearable device over 12 months. The control group received the wearable technology and access to the web‐based DDP but not the SMS texts. As this was a feasibility study, the primary aim was to estimate potential sample size at different stages of the study, including the size of the target study population and the proportion of participants who consented, were randomized, and completed follow‐up. We also measured the main outcomes for a full‐scale RCT, namely, change in weight and physical activity at 6‐ and 12‐month follow‐ups, and secondary outcomes, including changes in the HbA1c level, blood pressure, waist circumference, waist‐to‐hip ratio, and lipid levels. RESULTS: We enrolled 200 participants: 98 were randomized to the intervention and 102 were randomized to the control group. The follow‐up rate was higher in the control group (87/102, 85.3%) than in the intervention group (69/98, 70%) at 12 months. There was no treatment effect on weight at 6 months (mean difference 0.15; 95% CI ‐0.93 to 1.23) or 12 months (mean difference 0.07 kg; 95% CI ‐1.29 to 1.44) or for physical activity levels at 6 months (mean difference ‐382.90 steps; 95% CI ‐860.65 to 94.85) or 12 months (mean difference 92.64 steps; 95% CI ‐380.92 to 566.20). We did not observe a treatment effect on the secondary outcomes measured at the 6‐month or 12‐month follow‐up. For the intervention group, the mean weight was 92.33 (SD 15.67) kg at baseline, 91.34 (SD 16.04) kg at 6 months, and 89.41 (SD 14.93) kg at 12 months. For the control group, the mean weight was 92.59 (SD 17.43) kg at baseline, 91.71 (SD 16.48) kg at 6 months, and 91.10 (SD 15.82) kg at 12 months. In the intervention group, the mean physical activity was 7308.40 (SD 4911.93) steps at baseline, 5008.76 (SD 2733.22) steps at 6 months, and 4814.66 (SD 3419.65) steps at 12 months. In the control group, the mean physical activity was 7599.28 (SD 3881.04) steps at baseline, 6148.83 (SD 3433.77) steps at 6 months, and 5006.30 (SD 3681.1) steps at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is feasible to successfully recruit and retain patients in an RCT of a web‐based DPP.

KW  -  Carpal Tunnel Syndrome
KW  -  Syndrome
N2  -  Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common nerve entrapment syndrome. It occurs as a result of compression of the median nerve as it passes through a restricted osteofibrous canal in the wrist. Known as the carpal tunnel, this canal contains the wrist bones, transverse carpal ligament, median nerve, and digital flexor tendons. Edema, tendon inflammation, hormonal changes, and manual activity can contribute to increased nerve compression and sometimes cause pain. In more severe cases, weakness may occur in the muscles innervated by the median nerve, resulting in weakness in hand muscle strength(1). In a comprehensive study, the mean age for the diagnosis of CTS was found to be 50 years, and its prevalence was found to be similar in men and women. However, the prevalence was higher in women; The incidence in women aged 65‐74 was found to be four times higher than in men(2). Many different treatment methods are used in the treatment of CTS, and these treatments include regulation of daily activities, use of splints, tendon and nerve gliding exercises, ESWT, manual therapy, kinesiotaping, physical therapy agents, medical symptomatic treatments, injections into the carpal tunnel and surgical treatment options. . Suspected risk factors for CTS include diabetes mellitus, menopause, hypothyroidism, obesity, arthritis, and pregnancy. Since hypothyroidism, menopause, and pregnancy are risk factors, there is a strong suspicion that hormonal changes may play a role in the etiology of CTS; however, no evidence was found to support this hypothesis. In the diagnosis of CTS, a comprehensive and accurate clinical history should be taken together with the exclusion of other possible causes. The syndrome is characterized by intermittent and then increasing nocturnal paresthesia and dysesthesia findings. Later, sensory loss develops with hand muscle weakness and muscle atrophy of the thenar region, resulting from extensive axonal degeneration in the course of the disease. This set of symptoms is quite typical and rarely occurs in disorders other than CTS. In severe CTS cases, paresthesia symptoms may spread to the proximal forearm and upper arm, and sometimes to the shoulder(3). In the following periods, loss of strength and atrophy of the thenar region muscles may occur. The diagnosis is made by clinical examination, electrophysiological methods (EMG) and imaging methods (such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging). The clinical examination consists of sensory‐motor examination and provocative tests. 1‐2‐3 on sensory examination. numbness with touch (paresthesia) or low sense of touch (hypoesthesia) in the fingers are detected. Motor examination may be normal in the early stage, and later on, weakness (weakness) in the thumb abducting and opposing muscle is detected. In the first of the provocative tests, when the inside of the patient's wrist is hit with a reflex hammer, the patient usually feels an electric shock sensation in the first 3 fingers of the hand or a tingling sensation spreading to these fingers. This is known as Tinel's sign. In another clinical test, the patient is asked to flex both wrists (both wrists are flexed and the backs of both hands are touching each other) for 1 minute. In case of numbness and tingling spreading to the fingers, the test is considered positive (significant). , this is called the 'Phalen test'. Another diagnostic method, EMG, is performed by recording and evaluating electrical signals coming from nerves and muscles, using electricity and needles to diagnose nerve and muscle diseases. In CTS, a decrease in the conduction velocity of the median nerve is detected. In the diagnosis of CTS, the diagnosis is mostly made when the clinical picture and electrophysiological findings are evaluated well, but magnetic resonance imaging may be useful in some special cases (formations such as space‐occupying tumors). CTS treatment is divided into conservative and surgical. Conservative treatment methods include splinting (an assistive device worn on the body to relieve the nerve), exercise (sliding movements of the median nerve in the wrist and wrist flexor tendons), local corticosteroid injection (corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel), and ultrasound (deep with sound energy) from physical therapy applications. tissue heating), TENS (pain relief by applying controlled low‐voltage electric current to the nervous system through the skin with electrodes placed on the skin), paraffin bath (immersion of the hand in a heated paraffin pool), ergonomic arrangements. Surgical treatment includes decompression of the nerve (4). Virtual reality; It is defined as the use of interactive simulations created with computer hardware and software to offer users opportunities to enter environments that look and feel like real‐world objects and events. With the feeling of being in that environment and the possibility of interacting with the environment, it differs from products such as video and television(5). Virtual reality applications are grouped under 2 main headings as "immersive" and "non‐immersive" according to the level of user coverage of the environment. The degree of inclusiveness of the offered virtual environment depends on the level of interaction, as well as the ability to isolate the user from stimuli outside the virtual environment (such as external sounds and lights). In immersive virtual reality systems, head‐mounted screens (in the form of head‐mounted display; headgear, mask or glasses) are used, while non‐immersive virtual reality systems use screens(6). In this research the investigators aim to present the virtual reality‐mediated exercise program to patients non‐immersive. It is planned to use the Leap Motion motion sensor to detect hand and wrist movements and to monitor the gamified setup on the computer screen. The Leap Motion sensor is a hand motion sensor that rests on a stable platform and has no wearable or mountable parts on the patient. The Leap Motion sensor, whose main use is to control computers hands‐free, has no potential harm to patients. Within the scope of this research, no part will be placed on the hand or wrist of the patients, they will only be asked to move their hands at a distance of 30 cm from the relevant sensor. In the system that will be presented via computer and hand motion sensor, the patient will be asked to perform therapeutic exercises for the diagnosis of CTS in a scenario developed through virtual reality. The investigators predict that patients will actively participate in virtual reality‐mediated therapeutic exercise program with high motivation and their functional results will be better than classical exercise programs. The use of different rehabilitation protocols, which are also referred to as "serious games" in the medical field, in gamification and treatment has recently attracted attention. Virtual reality‐mediated exercises are used for neurological rehabilitation to reduce disability caused by different neurological diseases such as cerebral palsy, stroke, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases(7). In addition to neurological diseases, virtual reality‐based rehabilitation methods; It has also been used in studies for scoliosis exercises, cardiac rehabilitation, chronic pain management, and pulmonary rehabilitation and its effectiveness has been demonstrated (8,9,10). In our research, the investigators aim to present the tendon and nerve gliding exercises with proven effectiveness in patients with CTS, with non‐immersive virtual reality systems, and to compare their effectiveness with the classical exercise program.

N2  -  Objective: To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a health coaching intervention with mobile health technology in older adults with MCI or risk factors for dementia. Background: There is growing evidence that adherence to brain‐healthy behaviors can reduce the cognitive decline and risk of dementia. We recently demonstrated that a health coaching intervention facilitated adherence to these healthy lifestyle recommendations (Schwartz et al). The current study enhances the coaching intervention by adding technologies, including a mobile‐health platform and wearable fitness trackers. Design/Methods: Participants (target sample 45), age 60‐79, with MCI or dementia risk factors are being randomized to two groups: The Brain Health Champion (BHC) intervention or a counseling and education (CE) control. BHC participants work with health coaches over 6 months to set personalized goals, reinforced by weekly video calls, mobile messaging, consultation with a dietitian, and 30‐minute in‐person or virtual visits every six weeks. In CE, usual care is supplemented with educational materials sent every six weeks. Changes over the six‐month intervention in physical activity, diet, cognition, and social/cognitive activities are being measured using validated questionnaires, wearable fitness trackers, and photographed food logs. Results: To date, twenty BHC and eighteen CE participants have completed the study. All participants successfully operated the mobile technology. All BHC participants had increased scores on neuropsychological tests (PACC), social/cognitive activities, and photographed dietary adherence compared to CE. Increased quality of life and physical activity was reported in both groups (60% BHC vs 40% CE). Participation in the study was significantly associated with increased self‐reported Mediterranean diet adherence. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests that both BHC and CE are feasible and encouraging for adopting Brain‐healthy behaviors in patients with MCI and dementia risk. BHC group demonstrated more social/cognitive activities and adherence to Mediterranean diet. These strategies may become essential tools to prevent further cognitive decline in these vulnerable populations.

N2  -  Background: Patients undergoing valve surgery have a higher risk of developing post‐operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) relative to those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Whether this risk extends beyond hospital discharge is unknown. Purpose: We examined the association between surgery type (isolated CABG vs. valve repair/replacement) on the incidence of post‐operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) by conducting a secondary analysis of the Post‐ Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH‐AF) CardioLink‐1 randomized trial. Methods: In the SEARCH‐AF trial, 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched‐based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12‐lead ECG within 30 days of randomization. We compared the risk of POAF between patients who underwent CABG vs. valve repair/replacement. Patients who experienced postoperative AF during hospitalization were excluded from this analysis. Results: The overall cohort consisted of 255, 39, and 42 patients who underwent isolated CABG, isolated valve replacement/repair, and CABG + valve repair/replacement, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar among the groups except for younger age (p=0.0014), higher prevalence of preoperative myocardial infarction (p=0.002) and lower ejection fraction (p=0.025) in the isolated CABG group. Eighteen patients experienced post‐operative AF during hospitalization. Patients who underwent CABG + valve surgery or isolated valve surgery were more likely to experience post‐operative AF compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (Log‐Rank ptrend=0.0096). Among patients who were randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring, the probability of post‐operative AF among patients who underwent isolated CABG, valve surgery, and CABG + valve surgery was 15.8%, 29.4%, and 35.0%, respectively (Log‐ Rank ptrend=0.017). After multivariable adjustment, the risk of developing post‐operative AF within 30 days after discharge remained higher among patients who underwent valve surgery compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (hazard ratio (HR) 2.22, 95% CI 1.01‐4.87. Patients who underwent CABG + repair/replacement had the highest risk of experiencing post‐operative AF when compared to patients who underwent isolated CABG (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.12‐6.86). Conclusion: Patients undergoing valve repair or bioprosthetic valve replacement have a substantial risk of post‐operative AF within 30 days after discharge from surgery. An aggressive cardiac rhythm monitoring strategy during this vulnerable period should be considered for this high‐risk patient population. (Figure Presented).

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Self‐monitoring of behavior (namely, diet and physical activity) and physiology (namely, glucose) has been shown to be effective in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes prevention. By combining self‐monitoring technologies, the acute physiological consequences of behaviors could be shown, prompting greater consideration to physical activity levels today, which impact the risk of developing diabetes years or decades later. However, until recently, commercially available technologies have not been able to show individuals the health benefits of being physically active. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the usage, feasibility, and acceptability of behavioral and physiological self‐monitoring technologies in individuals at risk of developing T2D. METHODS: A total of 45 adults aged ≥40 years and at moderate to high risk of T2D were recruited to take part in a 3‐arm feasibility trial. Each participant was provided with a behavioral (Fitbit Charge 2) and physiological (FreeStyle Libre flash glucose monitor) monitor for 6 weeks, masked according to group allocation. Participants were allocated to glucose feedback (4 weeks) followed by glucose and physical activity (biobehavioral) feedback (2 weeks; group 1), physical activity feedback (4 weeks) followed by biobehavioral feedback (2 weeks; group 2), or biobehavioral feedback (6 weeks; group 3). Participant usage (including time spent on the apps and number of glucose scans) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were the feasibility (including recruitment and number of sensor displacements) and acceptability (including monitor wear time) of the intervention. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted at the 6‐week follow‐up appointment. RESULTS: For usage, time spent on the Fitbit and FreeStyle Libre apps declined over the 6 weeks for all groups. Of the FreeStyle Libre sensor scans conducted by participants, 17% (1798/10,582) recorded rising or falling trends in glucose, and 24% (13/45) of participants changed ≥1 of the physical activity goals. For feasibility, 49% (22/45) of participants completed the study using the minimum number of FreeStyle Libre sensors, and a total of 41 sensors were declared faulty or displaced. For acceptability, participants wore the Fitbit for 40.1 (SD 3.2) days, and 20% (9/45) of participants and 53% (24/45) of participants were prompted by email to charge or sync the Fitbit, respectively. Interviews unearthed participant perceptions on the study design by suggesting refinements to the eligibility criteria and highlighting important issues about the usability, wearability, and features of the technologies. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals at risk of developing T2D engaged with wearable digital health technologies providing behavioral and physiological feedback. Modifications are required to both the study and to commercially available technologies to maximize the chances of sustained usage and behavior change. The study and intervention were feasible to conduct and acceptable to most participants.

N2  -  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), affecting 1‐2 million people in the UK. AF significantly increases the risk of an AF‐related stroke, heart failure and dementia. A significant proportion of people will have no symptoms, and they may only be found to have AF after suffering an AF‐related stroke. An electrocardiogram (ECG) uses sensors placed on the skin to record the heart's electrical activity. A 12‐lead ECG uses 10 sensors and is the gold‐standard (best available test) to detect any abnormal heart rhythm disturbances. Until recently, a 12‐lead ECG showing an irregular heart rhythm was required to make a diagnosis of AF but as AF episodes are often short and unpredictable it may be missed. Therefore, a small device that continuously records heartbeat and heart rhythm could make the diagnosis of arrhythmias and AF much quicker and easier. Accessories such as watches or rings ‐ referred to as wearable devices ‐ have extremely good sensors that measure pulse rate by detecting small changes in skin colour during each heartbeat and can perform a single‐lead ECG. Algorithms built in the wearable devices can identify irregular heart rhythms, such as atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study is to test two new wearable devices ‐ the Skylabs CART‐I ring and the Apple Watch ‐ in detecting abnormal heart rhythm recording and recording ECGs. The investigators plan to recruit 500 patients attending Cardiology Departments in several hospitals in the UK and will ask them to wear the Apple Watch and the CART‐I and perform 12‐lead ECG with each device (two in total). No extra follow‐up visits are required. At the end of the study, the investigators will compare interpretation by two cardiologists of the wearable devices' ECGs and the 12‐lead ECGs and look at their ability to automatically detect abnormal rhythms.

N2  -  Background and Aims: ARISES (Adaptive, Real‐time, Intelligent Systemto Enhance Self‐care of chronic disease) is amobile platform facilitating a decision support system for people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). This project aims to improve the efficacy of current care and reduce the burden of managing diabetes in daily living. We incorporate wearable biosensors and leverage on‐device machine learning techniques towards improving glucose control. Methods: This work details the system architecture for ARISES. ARISES comprises inputs from a Dexcom G6 for CGM, and Empatica E4 for physiological signals. These data are wirelessly transmitted to the smartphone. These data are then input to machine learning models which provide insights on the future glucose trajectory by means of a dilated recurrent neural network algorithm, and detect external contributing factors ‐ exercise and stress. The second component is an insulin recommendation algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning that, using insights and historical data, provides bolus advice. Results: We developed the platform on Apple iOS and implemented it on an iPhone. The built‐in algorithm has been in silico validated and evaluated with retrospective clinical data. The performance of the platform will be evaluated in a randomised cross‐over clinical study with 12 participants over 8 weeks. Conclusions: The ARISES platform represents a step forward in decision support systems for T1D management due to the wealth of collected physiological data and the use of state‐of‐theart machine learning algorithms.

N2  -  Background: Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with an increased risk of complications for patients with AF. The impact of diabetes on post‐operative AF after cardiac surgery is not well‐defined. Purpose: We sought to characterize the effect of diabetes, insulin, and oral hypoglycemic agents on the incidence of post‐operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery. Accordingly, we conducted a secondary analysis of the Post‐Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH‐AF) CardioLink‐1 randomized trial. Methods: In the SEARCH‐AF trial, 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched‐based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12‐lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. We assessed the association between diabetes and occurrence of post‐operative AF. In addition, we examined the association between POAF and glucose‐lowering therapy among patients with diabetes. Results: Among the 176 (52%) patients with diabetes in the study cohort, 80 (45%) patients were treated with at least 1 oral hypoglycemic agent and 44 (25%) patients were treated with insulin. The incidence of POAF occurring within 30 days after discharge from surgery was similar between patients with or without diabetes (cumulative incidence: 10.8% vs. 10.0%, log‐rank p=0.77). Among patients with diabetes, the incidence of POAF was highest in those who were not treated with glucose‐lowering therapy (17.3%) when compared with those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (10.0%) or insulin (4.5%) (log‐rank ptrend=0.045 among the 3 groups). In an exploratory analysis, we observed a trend suggesting a lower incidence of POAF among cardiac surgical patients who were treated with SGLT‐2 inhibitors (log‐rank ptrend=0.084). Conclusion: The incidence of POAF occurring after discharge from cardiac surgery is equally high among patients with or without diabetes. Our results suggest a potential association between specific glucose‐lowering therapies and risk of POAF after cardiac surgery, meriting further investigations.

N2  -  Telemedicine allows clinicians to utilize modern telecommunication technology to provide healthcare services to patients including remote symptom monitoring. Given the spread of COVID‐19 both locally and globally, is crucial to adapt accordingly in order to safely provide vulnerable cancer patient populations with optimal care while minimizing risk of exposure to COVID‐19. In this study, the investigators will utilize remote monitoring of patients with cancer via weekly patient‐reported outcome (PRO) collection through the Way to Health (W2H) smartphone application and step data through wearable Fitbit devices. Patients with incurable lung and gastrointestinal cancers will be recruited based on whether they receive their care in‐clinic or remotely. They will respond to weekly phone‐based symptom surveys and wear Fitbits that track step data. This data will be collated in a Palliative Care Assessment Dashboard (PROStep Dashboard) sent to clinicians prior to each oncology visit to help inform patient management. In this feasibility study, two arms of patients will be monitored with symptom surveys and Fitbits; the study will randomize these patients to either 1) receive feedback in the form of a personalized dashboard of symptoms and activity levels or 2) receive no feedback. A third arm of patients will be randomized to receive no feedback, symptom surveys, or Fitbit device. Clinicians for patients in each arm will receive the PROstep Dashboard. The study will determine feasibility of this monitoring approach, and compare patient adherence to symptom surveys and step data collection between the two intervention arms.

N2  -  Background: Patients undergoing valve surgery have a higher risk of developing post‐operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) relative to those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Whether this risk extends beyond hospital discharge is unknown. Methods and Results: We examined the association between surgery type (isolated CABG vs. valve repair or replacement) on the incidence of POAF from a sub‐analysis of the Post‐Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH‐AF) CardioLink‐1 randomized trial. It randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched‐based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12‐lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. The trial excluded patients who underwent mechanical valve replacement or left atrial appendage ligation. We compared the risk of POAF between patients who underwent CABG vs. valve repair or replacement. Patients who experienced post‐operative AF during hospitalization were excluded from this analysis. The overall cohort consisted of 255, 39, and 42 patients who underwent isolated CABG, isolated valve replacement/repair, and CABG + valve repair/replacement, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar among the groups except for younger age (p=0.0014), higher prevalence of preoperative myocardial infarction (p=0.002) and lower ejection fraction (p=0.025) in the isolated CABG group. Eighteen patients experienced post‐operative AF during hospitalization. Among 3 surgery subgroups, patients who underwent CABG + valve surgery or isolated valve surgery were more likely to experience post‐operative AF compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (Log‐Rank ptrend=0.0096). Among patients who were randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring, the probability of post‐operative AF among patients who underwent isolated CABG, valve surgery, and CABG + valve surgery was 15.8%, 29.4%, and 35.0%, respectively (Log‐Rank ptrend=0.017). After multivariable adjustment, the risk of developing post‐operative AF within 30 days after discharge remained higher among patients who underwent valve surgery compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (hazard ratio (HR) 2.22, 95% CI 1.01‐4.87. Patients who underwent CABG + repair/replacement had the highest risk of experiencing post‐operative AF relative to patients who underwent isolated CABG (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.12‐6.86). Conclusion: An aggressive cardiac rhythm monitoring strategy for AF detection should be considered for patients who are discharged after valvular surgery in light of their elevated stroke risk.

N2  -  Chronic diseases are the leading cause of deaths in Singapore. The rising prevalence in chronic diseases with age and Singapore's rapidly aging population calls for new models of care to effectively prevent the onset and delay the progression of these diseases. Advancement in medical technology has offered new innovations that aid healthcare systems in coping with the rapid rising in healthcare needs. These include mobile applications, wearable technologies and machine learning‐derived personalized behaviorial interventions. The overall goal of the project is to improve health outcomes in chronic disease patients through delivering targeted nudges via mobile application and wearable to sustain behavioral change. Our overall objective is to design, develop, and evaluate an adaptive intervention platform on wearable devices and shared decision‐making during consultations for patients with diabetes and hypertension. Our aim for this study is to assess the clinical effectiveness of real‐time personalized educational and behavioural interventions delivered through wearable (Fitbit) and an integrative mobile application in improving patient glycaemic control measured using HbA1c over 9 months. Secondary outcomes will include change in systolic blood pressure, quality of life (QoL), patient activation, medication adherence, physical activity level, diet, direct healthcare cost and indirect healthcare cost over 9 months. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among patients with comorbid diabetes and hypertension. This proposal aims to develop sustainable and cost‐effective behavioural change among patients with comorbid diabetes and hypertension through patient empowerment and targeted chronic disease care.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular events, but most ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients do not obtain enough. METHODS AND RESULTS: ACTIVE REWARD (A Clinical Trial Investigating Effects of a Randomized Evaluation of Wearable Activity Trackers with Financial Rewards) was a 24‐week home‐based, remotely monitored, randomized trial with a 16‐week intervention (8‐week ramp‐up incentive phase and 8‐week maintenance incentive phase) and an 8‐week follow‐up. Patients used wearable devices to track step counts and establish a baseline. Patients in control received no other interventions. Patients in the incentive arm received personalized step goals and daily feedback for all 24 weeks. In the ramp‐up incentive phase, daily step goals increased weekly by 15% from baseline with a maximum of 10 000 steps and then remained fixed. Each week, $14 was allocated to a virtual account; $2 could be lost per day for not achieving step goals. The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. Ischemic heart disease patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11) years and 70% were male. Compared with control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp‐up (1388 versus 385; adjusted difference, 1061 [95% confidence interval, 386‐1736]; P<0.01), maintenance (1501 versus 264; adjusted difference, 1368 [95% confidence interval, 571‐2164]; P<0.001), and follow‐up (1066 versus 92; adjusted difference, 1154 [95% confidence interval, 282‐2027]; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Loss‐framed financial incentives with personalized goal setting significantly increased physical activity among ischemic heart disease patients using wearable devices during the 16‐week intervention, and effects were sustained during the 8‐week follow‐up.

N2  -  Background: Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients. However, most IHD patients do not participate in an exercise‐based cardiac rehabilitation program or obtain enough physical activity on their own. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of loss‐framed financial incentives with personalized goal‐setting in increasing physical activity among IHD patients using wearable devices. Methods: ACTIVE REWARD was a home‐based, remotely‐monitored, 24‐week randomized clinical trial with a 16‐week intervention (8‐week ramp‐up incentive phase and then 8‐week maintenance incentive phase) and an 8‐week follow‐up. 105 IHD patients were enrolled from four hospitals in Southeastern Pennsylvania. All patients tracked daily steps using a wearable device and established a baseline step count. Patients in control received no other interventions. Patients in the incentive arm received personalized step goals and daily feedback for all 24 weeks. In the ramp‐up incentive phase (weeks 1‐8), daily step goals increased from baseline by 15% each week to a maximum of 10,000 steps and then remained fixed during the maintenance incentive phase (weeks 9‐16) and follow‐up (weeks 17‐24). Incentives were loss‐framed by allocating $ 14 each week to a virtual account; $ 2 could be lost per day for not achieving step goals. The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. Secondary outcomes were change in mean daily steps from baseline to the ramp‐up incentive phase and follow‐up. Results: Patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11) years, 70% were male, and all had ischemic heart disease. Compared to control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp‐up (1388 vs. 385; adjusted difference, 1061 steps [95% CI, 386‐1736]; P<.01), maintenance (1501 vs. 264; adjusted difference, 1368 steps [95% CI, 571‐2164]; P<.001), and follow‐up (1066 vs. 92; adjusted difference, 1154 steps [95% CI, 282‐2027]; P<.01). Conclusions: Loss‐framed financial incentives with personalized goal‐setting significantly increased physical activity among IHD patients using wearable devices during the 16‐week intervention and effects were sustained during the 8‐week follow‐up.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial did not demonstrate a significant reduction in arrhythmic death with the wearable cardioverter‐defibrillator (WCD), but compliance with the device may have substantially affected the results. ThePletcher influence of WCD compliance on outcomes has not yet been fully evaluated. METHODS: Using linear and pooled logistic models, we performed as‐treated analyses omitting person‐time in the hospital and adjusted for correlates of WCD compliance. To assess the impact of early stopping of WCD, we performed a per‐protocol Kaplan‐Meier analysis, censoring after the last day the WCD was worn. Interactions of potential effect modifiers with treatment assignment and WCD compliance on outcomes were investigated. Finally, we used linear models to identify predictors of WCD compliance. RESULTS: A per‐protocol analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in total (P < .001) and arrhythmic (P = .001) mortality. Better WCD compliance was independently predicted by cardiac arrest during index myocardial infarction (MI), higher Cr, diabetes, prior heart failure, EF ≤ 25%, Polish enrolling center and number of WCD alarms, while worse compliance was predicted by being divorced, Asian race, higher body mass index, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, or any WCD shock. Neither excluding time in hospital from the as‐treated analysis nor adjustment for factors affecting WCD compliance materially changed the results. No variable demonstrated a significant interaction in either the intention‐to‐treat or as‐treated analysis. CONCLUSION: Robust sensitivity analyses of as‐treated and per‐protocol analyses suggest that the WCD is protective in compliant patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% during the first 3 months post‐MI.

N2  -  Purpose Integrating patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) into clinical practice is an increasingly promising strategy for improving patients' symptoms, communication, and clinical outcomes. The objective of the current study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived effectiveness of a mobile health intervention that was designed to collect PROs and activity data as a measure of health status. Patients and Methods This work was a pilot intervention with 10 patients with gynecologic cancers who received palliative chemotherapy. The HOPE (Helping Our Patients Excel) study used wearable accelerometers to assess physical activity and the Beiwe research platform to collect PROs, stratify patient responses by risk, provide tailored symptom management, and notify patients and clinicians of high‐risk symptoms. Feasibility and acceptability were assessed through enrollment and adherence rates, and perceived effectiveness was evaluated by patients and oncologists at study completion. Results The approach‐to‐consent rate was 100%, and participants were 90% and 70% adherent to the wearable accelerometers and smartphone surveys, respectively. Participants' mean daily step count was 3,973 (standard deviation [SD], 2,305 steps) and increased from week 1 (mean, 3,520 steps; SD, 1,937 steps) to week 3 (mean, 4,136 steps; SD, 1,578 steps). Active monitoring of participants' heart rates, daily steps, and PROs throughout the study identified anomalies in participants' behavior patterns that suggested poor health for two patients (20%). Patients and clinicians indicated that the intervention improved physical activity, communication, and symptom management. Conclusion A mobile health intervention that collects PROs and activity data as a measure of health status is feasible, acceptable, and was perceived to be effective in improving symptom management in patients with advanced gynecologic cancers. A larger, multisite, randomized clinical trial to assess the efficacy of the HOPE intervention on patients' symptoms, health‐related quality of life, clinical outcomes, and health care use is warranted.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death both globally and in the United Arab Emirates. Despite public health measures and health education, the rates of death from CVD remain stable. Barriers previously identified to lifestyle changes include cultural reasons, boredom, and lack of family support. The Emirates Heart Health Project (EHHP) seeks to support healthy lifestyle changes through a family‐based intervention using a health coach and fitness tracker. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The EHHP is a stepped‐wedge cluster‐randomized trial with each cluster comprised of members of an extended family. Eligible participants will be ≥ 18 years of age, with BMI ≥ 25, have Emirati citizenship and be able to give informed consent for study participation. The cluster will have 16 weekly teaching sessions in the participants' family home by a health coach who will review individual weight, diet and exercise (monitored by a wearable fitness tracker). The clusters will have pre‐intervention assessments of their weight and CVD risk profile and enter the intervention in randomized order. Each cluster will have a post‐intervention assessment of the same measures. The primary outcome is weight reduction from baseline. Secondary outcomes will include change in CVD risk factors such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, waist circumference, and BMI. A mixed linear model will be used for analysis, where the parameters measured at the end of each 16‐week episode will be the outcome values. These will be analyzed such that baseline values (measured just prior to the start of an episode) will be fixed covariables. Random effects are the family units. This trial has been registered with the NIH at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04688684) and is being reported using the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) and TIDieR (Template for intervention description and replication) framework. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT04688684.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: Patients will be randomised 1:1 to either the TIHM for Dementia System of Care (Intervention arm) or standard care (control arm) Intervention arm: TIHM for Dementia System of Care – an Internet of Things (IoT) health monitoring and management system. This system gathers information about the person with dementia through environmental sensors installed in their home and devices which monitor their whereabouts and vital signs (e.g. GPS tracker, blood pressure monitor, thermometer, weighing scales). The IoT relays this information to a dedicated monitoring team, via an algorithm design to detect health concerns. The monitoring team receives an alert on their computer interface when a health concern is detected. The monitoring team then contacts the patient to offer advice. Patients are monitored by the TIHM for Dementia system 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for their 6 months of participation. Patients and their nominated carers are required to complete some paper‐based questionnaires before they start using the system at baseline, 3 months and on completing at 6 months. Standard Care arm: Standard care is any care a person with dementia receives from their general practitioner (GP) or secondary mental health team. CONDITION: Dementia ; Mental and Behavioural Disorders PRIMARY OUTCOME: Hospitalisation as measured through carer self‐reporting using the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) questionnaire taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. SECONDARY OUTCOME: 1. Duration of hospital stay (carer self‐report); 2. Time to admission to residential care (carer self‐report); 3. Incidence and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms experienced by the PwD assessed using ; the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI); 4. Activities of daily living of the PwD assessed using the Bristol Activity of Daily Living Scale (BADL); 5. Health‐related quality of life (HR‐QoL) of the PwD assessed using Dementia Quality of Life Measure (DEMQOL), DEMQOL‐proxy and EQ‐5D‐5L questionnaires; 6. HR‐QoL of carers assessed using EQ‐5D‐5L and Adult Carer Quality of Life questionnaires; 7. Carer burden assessed using the Zarit Caregiver burden scale; 8. Technology acceptance assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Measure (TAM); 9. Attitudes towards technology assessed using Global Attitude Towards Technology Measure: Technophobia; ; All measures taken at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Person with dementia: 1. Aged over 50 years 2. Living at home in the community 3. Confirmed diagnosis of mild‐to‐moderate dementia made at least 3 months previously 4. Stable dementia ‐ if on dementia medication had a stable dose for 3 months prior to recruitment 5. Baseline standard Mini–Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of greater than or equal to 14 6. A live‐in or nominated carer providing at least 10 hours care per week Carer: 1. Aged 18 years or over 2. Nominated carer (by their relative/friend with dementia) who had known the person with dementia for at least 6 months 3. Able to attend research assessments with the person with dementia 4. Sufficient functional English to allow completion of the assessment instructions

N2  -  Background: Although many electrocardiography wearable devices have been released recently for the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), there are few studies reporting prospective data for wearable devices compared to the strategy of the existing guidelines in the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cryptogenic stroke. A tiny single‐patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE‐AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72‐h single‐patch monitor to standard strategy and non‐inferiority of the 72‐h single‐patch monitor to an event‐recorder‐type device will be investigated. Single‐patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event‐recorder‐type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE‐AF will clarify the role of a single‐lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

N2  -  Background: Technological progress has enabled the provision of personalised feedback across multiple dimensions of physical activity that are important for health. Whether this multidimensional approach supports physical activity behaviour change has not yet been examined. Our objective was to examine the effectiveness of a novel digital system and app that provided multidimensional physical activity feedback combined with health trainer support in primary care patients identified as at risk of chronic disease. Methods: MIPACT was a parallel‐group, randomised controlled trial that recruited patients at medium (≥10 and < 20%) or high (≥20%) risk of cardiovascular disease and/or type II diabetes from six primary care practices in the United Kingdom. Intervention group participants (n = 120) received personal multidimensional physical activity feedback using a customised digital system and web‐app for 3 months plus five health trainer‐led sessions. All participants received standardised information regarding physical activity. Control group participants (n = 84) received no further intervention. The primary outcome was device‐based assessment of physical activity at 12 months. Results: Mean intervention effects were: moderate‐vigorous physical activity: ‐1.1 (95% CI, ‐ 17.9 to 15.7) min/day; moderate‐vigorous physical activity in ≥10‐min bouts: 0.2 (‐ 14.2 to 14.6) min/day; Physical Activity Level (PAL): 0.00 (‐ 0.036 to 0.054); vigorous physical activity: 1.8 (‐ 0.8 to 4.2) min/day; and sedentary time: 10 (‐ 19.3 to 39.3) min/day. For all of these outcomes, the results showed that the groups were practically equivalent and statistically ruled out meaningful positive or negative effects (>minimum clinically important difference, MCID). However, there was profound physical activity multidimensionality, and only a small proportion (5%) of patients had consistently low physical activity across all dimensions. Conclusion: In patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and/or type II diabetes, MIPACT did not increase mean physical activity. Using a sophisticated multidimensional digital approach revealed enormous heterogeneity in baseline physical activity in primary care patients, and practitioners may need to screen for low physical activity across dimensions rather than rely on disease‐risk algorithms that are heavily influenced by age. Trial registration: This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN18008011; registration date 31 July 2013).

KW  -  Hypertension, Pregnancy‐Induced
N2  -  Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are the most common medical conditions in pregnancy and a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in the United States. HDP are also associated with significant financial costs to the US healthcare system; $2.18 billion is spent on treatment of affected mothers and infants in the first year after delivery. Women exposed to HDP are at increased lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease, dementia, and all‐cause mortality. Current interventions to prevent HDP are limited and do not target underlying mechanisms of disease. Mindfulness training (MT) holds tremendous promise as a mind‐body intervention to prevent HDP. MT is effective at reducing blood pressure in non‐pregnant patients with pre‐hypertension and hypertension and has proven more effective at blood pressure reduction than other stress management interventions. Results from the pilot RCT were the first to indicate that prenatal phone‐delivered MT is feasible and had a medium to large effect on cardiovascular parameters in women at risk for HDP. However, the mechanisms through which prenatal MT affects cardiovascular parameters are not yet understood. MT teaches participants to "attend and respond in a non‐judgmental way to ordinary, everyday experiences." Theory and available evidence indicate that MT elicits relaxation, decreases stress biomarkers and autonomic activation, and decreases loneliness ‐‐‐ dynamic processes that may serve as pathways to improved cardiovascular parameters in women at risk for HDP. The proposed RCT will harness subjective and objective ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodologies (in vivo repeated assessments) in combination with wearable biosensor technology to capture rich epochs of ecologically‐valid psychological, physiological, and interpersonal processes through which MT may lead to improved maternal cardiovascular parameters. Pregnant women at risk for HDP will be randomized to an 8‐week phone‐delivered MT intervention or usual care. For every participant, the research team will measure maternal cardiovascular parameters (24‐hour blood pressure and uterine artery resistance values by ultrasound Doppler) before and after the RCT. All participants will complete EMA for 2 weeks 'bursts' before and after the RCT to evaluate mechanisms of MT on cardiovascular parameters. EMA will include smartphone‐app based experience sampling of psychological processes; smartphone‐app based ambient audio sampling (i.e. the Electronically Activated Recorder [EAR] method) and wearable wrist‐worn biosensor monitoring of physiological responses (heart rate and heart rate variability) to everyday experiences. Results will provide new insights into 1) effects of MT on cardiovascular parameters in pregnancy, 2) pathophysiological mechanisms of HDP, and 3) targets for new HDP prevention strategies.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Current literature on fall prevention for community‐dwelling elderly who are at risk of falling suggests that: 1) either single, multicomponent or multifactorial interventions are effective at preventing falls; 2) elderly at risk of falling with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and previous Stroke, although having an even greater risk of falling, are often excluded by these interventions; 3) often, present screening methods for risk of falling do not allow the early identification of subjects at risk before the first fall. AIMS ‐ To compare the efficacy of an interdisciplinary multicomponent and personalized multifactorial intervention aiming at reducing falls in comparison to the usual care, in a sample of community dwelling elderly, with or without Parkinson's Disease and/or previous Stroke, within the context of an RCT. ‐ To improve the accuracy of screening tests for risk of falling by using wearable inertial sensors. ‐ To develop a reduced set of clinical and instrumental indicators, to be utilized as a quick and reliable screening tests in outpatients clinics. METHODS: multicenter, randomized controller trial, with blind assessments on pretest, postest and on one‐year follow‐up. POPULATION: community‐dwelling elderly (aged ≥65 years) with age‐related or neurological condition‐related (Parkinson's Disease and/or Stroke) risk of falling. INTERVENTION: interdisciplinary multi‐component (group‐based exercise; home‐based exercise; increasing knowledge/education; home safety interventions) and personalized multi‐factorial interventions (assessment and treatment of individual fall risk factors) CONTROL: structured information about participant's own personal risk factors given to the family doctor. OUTCOMES: The primary endpoint is the fall rate at one year in both groups. The secondary endpoint is the fall risk at one year. EXPECTED RESULTS: in the intervention group, a significant reduction in the number of total fall is expected, together with decreases indicators of utilization of acute health services because of falls. At three months, it is expected a significant improvement of functioning (motor functions, activity and participation) and health quality indicators.

N2  -  Approximately 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year and 689,450 reported having short and long‐term disabilities leading to dependence in activities of daily living. It has been reported that stroke survivors experienced detrimental falls each year and most occurring during walking. The likelihood of experiencing a fall upon discharge from rehabilitation being significantly higher than during the rehabilitative phase. Falls resulting from environmental perturbations such as slips contribute to a significant percentage of these falls. Hence, it is important to develop innovative and effective paradigms for fall‐risk reduction in chronic as well as sub‐acute stroke survivors. The purpose of this research is to understand the effect of bilateral slip‐perturbation training protocol targeting training both paretic vs. non‐paretic limbs on fall‐risk reduction and prevention. Also, to find its effect on increasing community ambulation in community dwelling stroke survivors. Participants in this study will be individuals with chronic (> 6 months) hemiparesis following stroke or individuals with sub‐acute stroke (> 6weeks and < 6 months), ambulatory (with or without assistive device) and more than 21 years of age. Subjects will be screened for the inclusion criteria. If subjects pass the screening, they will go through the full clinical balance assessment and laboratory dynamic stability test. The chronic stroke survivors will be randomized into two groups: ‐ Group A: Slip training group; Group B: Control group. While, the sub‐acute stroke survivors will be randomized into two groups: ‐ Group C: Slip training group; Group D: Control group. For the slip training groups (A and C), all subjects' normal walking pattern and their recovery responses to slip will be recorded with a motion tracking system (including videotaping) while they walk across an instrumented area along a straight path in the lab. A slip will be induced after a subject steps on a low‐friction platform. For the chronic stroke subjects, baseline activity monitoring using wearable sensors will be performed for up to four weeks prior to the training session followed by activity monitoring for 12 months. While for the sub‐acute stroke subjects, it would be done for 6 months. For groups A and B, the follow‐up stability test will be at 6 and 12 months post‐training session, which will consist only of one slip induced on the training side and contralateral side. For groups C and D, follow‐up session is 6 months post training session. Incidence of falls and physical activity will be monitored between training and re‐test sessions through falls, activity monitoring‐questionnaire to describe details of the falls and through the wearable sensors for groups A, B, C and D.

N2  -  Background: Up to a third of patients with diabetes are undiagnosed, and therefore go untreated. Widely available consumer technologies could detect diabetes at an early stage. Since diabetes is associated with vascular changes, we examined whether diabetes could be detected using only the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, a measurement readily obtained from smartphones and wearable devices, using a convolution neural network (CNN). Methods: We studied 22,298 individuals enrolled in the Health eHeart Study, an IRB‐approved UCSF study, who used the Azumio smartphone app. Users were randomly divided into separate training (70%), development (10%), and test (20%) datasets. We fit a 34‐layer CNN using the training dataset to predict self‐reported prevalent diabetes. The development dataset was used for model tuning, and model discrimination was measured using area under the receiver‐operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the test dataset. Results: The mean age was 47.0 ± 14.0 years, 69% were male and 1,331 (6.0%) had diabetes. Of 1,440,000 PPG measurements that were utilized, 101,455 (7.0%) were derived from diabetic participants. The AUC for predicting prevalent diabetes in the test dataset was 0.772 (95% CI 0.747 ‐ 0.797). Conclusion: We demonstrate that deep learning can be used to detect prevalent diabetes from the PPG signal alone with reasonable discrimination. This study constitutes the first proof‐of‐concept demonstration that smartphone‐based PPG can be used for diabetes detection. [Figure presented]

KW  -  Disease Progression
N2  -  Owing to the massive outbreak of COVID‐19, as of March 9, 2020, the virus has reportedly caused 108,618 infections and 3,800 deaths globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID‐19 disease a public health emergency of international concern. As there has yet been specific therapeutic or vaccine for the condition, rigorous implementation of traditional public health measures including isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment is the principle strategy to control the COVID‐19 epidemic. In addition to the isolation of confirmed COVID‐19 infected patients from noninfected population, it is equally if not more important to quarantine asymptomatic individuals with possible exposure to COVID‐19 in order to reduce the viral spread. Indeed, quarantine measures have been initiated in many countries and regions, which restrict movements of asymptomatic individuals with COVID‐19 exposure often with fever and symptom surveillance at home or designated facilities for the presumed incubation period (14 days). While conceptually attractive, the intermittency and high dependency of selfdiscipline for body temperature and symptom surveillance undermine the practicality and effectiveness of the approach. Furthermore, it has been reported that as many as 50% of COVID‐19 infected patients had not had fever until the full‐blown disease, thereby body temperature surveillance per se may not be sufficient to detect early disease progression. In the past few decades, advances in sensor technology miniaturize electronic physiological sensors that could be incorporated into wearable devices allowing continuous monitoring of physiological parameters such as skin temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, perspiration and activity of ambulatory subjects in a 24/7 basis. Together with current telecommunication platform capable of instantaneous and multi‐directional massive data transfer, it is possible to remotely monitor a large number of individual subjects' physiological parameters in a real‐time manner, and relay to managing physicians for timely intervention. Nonetheless, such potentials have not been fully explored in the real‐world disease management. The current study will assess the impact of remote continuous real‐time physiological monitoring using wearable armband device Everion® (Biofourmis, Singapore) and artificial intelligence‐powered analytical platform Biovitals® Sentinel (Biofourmis, Singapore) on detection of disease progression in asymptomatic subjects with COVID‐19 exposure under mandatory quarantine at designated facilities in Hong Kong. The research hypothesis is that by processing continuous physiological data collected using wearable device Everion® and patient reported outcomes with a cloud‐based analytics platform Biovitals® Sentinel, it will possible to detect physiological changes and other clinically meaningful alerts that indicate early clinical progression in quarantined subjects with COVID‐19 exposure. The wearable vital sign monitor Everion® is capable to track multiple vitals sings including heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pulse variation, respiration rate under rest, activity, steps, skin temperature and etc. It is Bluetooth connected to a dedicated study‐smartphone that allows remote transfer of all the physiological data captured by the wearable device in real time. A specially‐designed application (APP) on the study‐smartphone enables the patient to participate in health monitoring by reporting symptoms regularly and make aware of his/her physical and physiological patterns via the monitoring displays on the smart‐phone. The patient's passive physiological data from the device and the active data on the symptoms and outcomes from Biovitals® analytics platform are automatically transferred to the monitoring console on the cloud. Thus, the Biofourmis platform solution is proposed to allow the monitoring team to effectively and remotely monitor COVID‐19 patients and evaluate the disease progression. Leveraging Everion, the smartphone APP, Biovitals® analytics platform and the caregiver dashboard, biofourmis has built an end to end solution, Biovitals® Sentinel to remote monitor and manage the suspected subjects.

N2  -  Background: There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of statins to reduce the risk of post‐operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods and Results: We sought to determine the effects of statin use on the incidence of post‐discharge POAF in the Post‐Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH‐AF) CardioLink‐1 randomized controlled trial. This trial randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched‐based device. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cumulative AF/AFL lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12‐lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. We evaluated the association between the risk of post‐operative AF in relation to statin use and dosing intensity (low, moderate, high) at the time of discharge. We excluded patients who experienced post‐operative AF during hospitalization in this analysis. In the overall cohort (n=336), 260 (77.4%) patients were treated with statins at the time of hospital discharge. There were 18 (5.4%) patients who experienced post‐operative AF during hospitalization. Patients prescribed with statins were more likely to be male (p=0.018), had lower CHA2DS2‐VASc scores (p=0.011), and were more likely to undergo isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (p=0.083). Patients treated with statins at discharge had a 2‐fold lower rate of POAF than those who were not treated with statins in the overall cohort (17.6% vs. 8.2%, Log‐Rank p=0.017) and in those randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring (31.6% vs. 16.0%, Log‐Rank p=0.027) (Figure). After adjusting for surgery type (CABG vs. valve surgery) and the CHA2DS2‐VASc score, statin use at discharge was associated with a lower risk of post‐operative AF within 30 days after surgery (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24‐0.97). Increased intensity of statin therapy was associated with lower risk of POAF (P=0.0012 for trend). (Figure) Conclusion: High‐intensity statin could reduce the risk of POAF among cardiac surgical patients with risk factors for stroke. This merits further study. [Formula presented]

N2  -  Background: There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of statins to reduce the risk of post‐operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Purpose:We sought to determine the effects of statin use on the burden of new‐onset post‐discharge POAF in the Post‐Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH‐AF) CardioLink‐1 randomized controlled trial. Methods: In the SEARCH‐AF trial, 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched‐based device. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12‐lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. Using time‐to‐event analysis and Cox regression, we evaluated the association between the risk of post‐operative AF in relation to statin use and dosing intensity (low, moderate, high) at the time of discharge. We excluded patients who experienced post‐operative AF during hospitalization in this analysis. Results: In the overall cohort (n=336), 260 (77.4%) patients were treated with statins at the time of hospital discharge. There were 18 (5.4%) patients who experienced post‐operative AF during hospitalization. Patients prescribed with statins were more likely to be male (p=0.018), had lower CHA2DS2‐VASc scores (p=0.011), and were more likely to undergo isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (p=0.083). Baseline characteristics were otherwise similar between the 2 groups. Patients treated with statins at discharge had a 2‐fold lower rate of post‐operative AF than those who were not treated with statins in the overall cohort (17.6% vs. 8.2%, Log‐Rank p=0.017) and among those who were randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring (31.6% vs. 16.0%, Log‐Rank p=0.027) (Figure). After adjusting for surgery type (CABG vs. valve surgery) and the CHA2DS2‐VASc score, statin use at discharge was associated with a lower risk of post‐operative AF within 30 days after surgery (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24‐0.97). Furthermore, increasing intensity of statin therapy was associated with lower risk of POAF (ptrend=0.0012) (Figure 1) Conclusion: Among cardiac surgery patients with risk factors for stroke and no history of pre‐operative AF, the use of statins was associated with a reduction in post‐operative AF risk within 30 days of discharge. The routine use of high‐intensity statin to prevent post‐operative AF after cardiac surgery deserves further study.

N2  -  Background: Efforts to increase physical activity in cancer survivors have typically been facility‐based, and results have generally not been durable. Home‐based interventions provide a more feasible option, and are likely to produce longer‐lasting benefits. Wearable trackers present a novel opportunity for monitoring physical activity in a practical way. The Health Action Process Approach model suggests that strategies such as action‐planning and overcoming barriers may be effective for transitioning individuals from intention to behavioural change. This trial aims to increase physical activity in cancer survivors at cardiovascular risk, by implementing a 24‐week self‐monitoring and action‐planning intervention using Fitbits. Methods: Sixty‐eight cancer survivors were recruited to participate in the trial. Eligibility criteria included: insufficiently physically active, presence of cardiovascular risk factors, and completion of active cancer treatment in the five years prior to recruitment. Trial assessments are performed at baseline, 12‐weeks, and 24‐weeks, and measure physical activity (using 7‐day accelerometer data), BMI, blood pressure, physical activity attitudes, barriers and perceived outcomes. Participants were randomly allocated to treatment and control groups, following the baseline assessment. Each participant in the treatment group was given a Fitbit Alta to monitor activity for the 24‐week trial, attended two 2‐hour group sessions involving goal‐setting and action‐planning activities, and a follow‐up phone call to ensure program adherence. Results: Data collection is currently underway. Data analysis will use the Group x Time interaction from a General Linear Mixed Model analysis. Conclusions: As the population of cancer survivors is largely inactive and at cardiovascular risk, interventions are warranted. Specifically, physical activity interventions that are feasible, have robust theoretical underpinnings, and suit the preferences of cancer survivors post‐treatment, show promise as a long‐term solution.

N2  -  This research study aims to help design and validate a novel technology to remotely provide exercise intervention for people at risk or with some level of dementia. In addition, the platform enables remote assessment of cognitive‐motor performance via wearable sensors through playing a simple interactive game named iTMT. A remote exercise intervention tailored to those with cognitive impairments could make significant impact in preserving cognitive function in people with MCI, promoting independent living, and reducing costs associated with consequence of cognitive‐motor decline including falls and frailty. This application could in addition further the knowledge in use and development of remote technology to screen cognitive and motor performance and promote independent living in older adults in particular for those who are suffering from cognitive impairment and dementia. Given the large and growing number of older people at risk of developing cognitive impairment and dementia, this knowledge would be important to health providers, clinicians, older people, and their caregivers. 100 subjects will be randomized into either intervention or control group. All recruited subjects will undergo to 12 weeks exercise program using the Exergaming platform described in the proposal, twice per week for approximately 30 minutes. The intervention group will be given the Exergaming system and will perform the 24 exercise sessions remotely. The control group will perform the exercise sessions in person under supervision with the Exergaming system.

N2  -  Stroke is the first cause of permanent disability worldwide. The last American Heart Association (AHA) statistical update showed that in the next years the rate of people affected by stroke is going to increase, most in young people. Indeed, last projections showed that by 2030 an additional 3.4 million adults will have had a stroke, a 20.5% increase in prevalence from 2021. Moreover, upper limb motor impairment is one of the most common sequelae after stroke. The impairment of upper limb motor functions compromises the level of autonomy of the patients in activity of daily living. Thus, the recovery of upper limb sensory‐motor functions remains one of the most important goals in stroke rehabilitation. In the last years, new approaches in neurorehabilitation field have been investigated to enhance motor recovery. The use of wearable devices consist of the application of sensors to the patient's body parts. The advantage of wearable sensor is to collect data from patients' movements to assess motor functions with high level of accuracy. Moreover, wearable device combined with surface electromyography (i.e. sEMG) electrodes allows to detect patients muscle activation during motor performance. sEMG is used also to provide to the patients the biofeedback about their muscle activity during exercises execution to enhance motor control and motor recovery. Surface electromyographic biofeedback showed good results in neurological conditions to improve motor control and hand motor recovery. The investigators developed a wearable device (REMO®) that collected sEMG from forearm muscles during hand movements. In recent works, the investigators defined the feasibility and security of using REMO in a rehabilitation setting. Moreover, the investigators defined the clinical features of stroke patients able to control the device to execute up to 10 hand movements in order to control a rehabilitation computer interface. The aim of this study is to define the efficacy of using REMO® (Morecognition srl, Turin,Italy) for hand motor recovery after stroke compared to a specific protocol of hand motor rehabilitation (i.e., task‐oriented training). A randomised‐controlled trial will be conducted compared to a task‐oriented training, in hand motor rehabilitation after stroke. 28 patients with diagnosis of first stroke event, and with no other neurological diagnosis or severe cognitive impairment, will be enrolled in this study. After randomization process, participants will be allocated in Experimental Group (REMO training) or in Control Group (task‐oriented training). The participants will be assessed before and after the treatment to define the clinical effects of the hand training. Moreover, the investigators will collect sEMG data using REMO device during 12 hand movements required to the patients before and after the training. The treatment consists of 15 sessions, (1hour/day, for 5 days/week, for 3 weeks). Finally, the sEMG of the same 12 hand movements will be collected from 15 healthy subjects to compare patients' muscle activation with a normal reference model.

N2  -  Introduction/Background: Gait recovery in post‐stroke patients is one of the main goals of post‐stroke rehabilitation. Wearable over‐ground powered exoskeletons allow individuals with gait dysfunctions to perform an over‐ground gait training. Literature lacks of clinical studies on exoskeleton‐supported gait rehabilitation in stroke patients and on setting modalities. Ekso is a wearable exoskeleton equipped with 4 motors, which allows the patient to stand up, sit and walk on a flat hard surface. The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical effects of an over‐ground walking training with a wearable powered exoskeleton (Ekso), after a sEMG fine tuning, in sub‐acute stroke patients. Material and method: This is a pilot pre‐post, open label, non randomized, non controlled experimental study. 47 sub‐acute stroke patients underwent a walking rehabilitation training of 15 sessions (60 min/session, 3 times/week) using Ekso. A surface electromyography (sEMG) of rectus femoris, hamstrings, tibialis anterior and soleus of both limbs was collected in order to define the best setting for each patient. Clinical evaluation was performed at the beginning of the training period (t1), and after 15 sessions (t2) using: Barthel Index, Ashworth scale, Motricity Index, Trunk Control Test, Functional Ambulation Scale, 10 meter walking test, 6 minutes walking test, and Walking Handicap Scale. Wilcoxon's tests (P < 0.05) was used to detect significant changes between data. Results: Significant statistical improvements were found between t0‐t2 in Barthel Index, Motricity Index, Trunk Control Test, Functional Ambulation Scale, 10 meter walking test, and 6 minutes walking test. Conclusion: Fifteen sessions of over‐ground gait training using a powered wearable robotic exoskeleton, set with sEMG, improve ambulatory functions in sub‐acute post‐stroke patients. Further studies are needed to better understand the treatment effect. Copyright © 2018

N2  -  Background: Wireless vital parameter continuous monitoring (WVPCM) after discharge is compared to regular monitoring to provide data on the clinical‐economic impact of complex patients (CPs) discharged from Internal Medicine Units of Ospedale dei Castelli, Lazio. Primary outcome: Major complications (MC) reduction. Secondary outcomes: Patients who reached discharge criteria within the 7th day from admission; difference in MC incidence at the conclusion of the standard telemonitoring/clinical monitoring phase, 5 and 30 days after discharge; and conditions predisposing to MC occurrence. Methods: Open label randomized controlled trial with wearable wireless system that creates alerts on portable devices. Continuous glycemic monitoring is performed for patients with diabetes mellitus. Results: There were 110 patients enrolled (mean age: 76.2 years). Comorbidity: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS‐CI (comorbidities index): 3.93, CIRS SI (severity index): 1.93. About 19% scored a BRASS (Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score) ?20 indicating need for discharge planning requiring step‐down care. Globally, 48% of patients in the control group had major complications (27 out of 56 patients), in contrast to 22% in the intervention group (12 out of 54 patients). Conclusions: Since WVPCM detects early complications during the post‐discharge CPs monitoring, it increases safety and reduces inappropriate access to the Emergency Room, preventing avoidable re‐hospitalizations.

N2  -  Background Many cancer patients experience severe levels of psychological distress, with a percentage varying from 10‐15% to 20‐40% (Mitchell et al., 2011; Shim et al., 2018). The average prevalence of mood disorders ranges from 29% in palliative care settings to 38% in cancer and hematological contexts (Jacobsen et al., 2005). In addition to the emotional distress, the advanced stages of the disease often imply a progressive loss of functional autonomy (Dong et al., 2016). This put the patient in a status of deprivation and forced isolation from relational and social aspects that were hitherto in their lives. This psychological distress naturally adds to the burden of the physical symptoms caused by the disease and/or invasive therapies, above all pain. In the last years, technological innovation has allowed new solutions to meet old and emerging needs in the healthcare field. One of these is represented by Virtual Reality (VR), a non‐invasive simulation technology that allows the user to be immersed in a multisensory experience. VR technologies can emotionally involve the patients, inducing a positive mood and allowing them to feel as a part of the virtual environment (Malloy and Milling, 2010; Pourmand et al., 2018; Ahmadpour et al., 2019). The distraction effect is recognized to be the primary principle underlying the effectiveness of VR (Schneider et al., 2004; Malloy and Milling, 2010; Wiederhold et al., 2014; Bani Mohammad and Ahmad, 2019), as it is capable of diverting patient's attention from his or her current clinical condition. Natural contents have been shown to induce relaxation and restore work productivity, based on the Attention Restoration Theory (Kaplan, 1995; Berto, 2005; Anderson et al., 2017). Moreover, water scenes with views and the sound seem to be more appreciated than scenes without water (White et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2017). Additionally, interactive contents could be even more effective in their distraction‐based effect than contents that only require passive observation (Wiederhold and Wiederhold, 2007; Shahrbanian et al., 2012; Wender et al., 2019). VR‐based interventions are a convenient solution, as they do not require complicated training to be used and can be employed in case of low mobility conditions. VR has been used as an adjuvant treatment in various clinical conditions to relieve from pain, anxiety, and depression (Dascal et al., 2017; Fodor et al., 2018), during invasive procedures (Hoffman et al., 2011; Shetty et al., 2019; Brown and Foronda, 2020), for chronic pain management (Wiederhold et al., 2014; Pekyavas and Ergun, 2017) and in rehabilitation settings (Shahrbanian et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2015). It has been extensively employed in promoting cancer patients' psychological well‐being (Chirico et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2019; Ioannou et al., 2020). Previous studies assessed the effects of VR in relieving cancer‐related symptomatology mainly in clinical settings (Li et al., 2011; Baños et al., 2013; Mosadeghi et al., 2016; Bani Mohammad and Ahmad, 2019), alleviating anxiety and improving mood states. Studies in palliative care (PC) have proven the acceptability of VR interventions (Oyama, 1997; Brungardt et al., 2020; Weingarten et al., 2020) and their effect in reducing short‐term symptoms (i.e., pain, drowsiness, lack of appetite, shortness of breath, depression, anxiety, and well‐being) (Niki et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2020). The evidence about the use of VR in a home PC program is still insufficient. To fill this gap, the National Tumor Assistance Foundation (ANT), a non‐profit organization working in Italy in the field of home PC and pain management, conducted a pilot study to test the feasibility of VR interventions for cancer patients assisted at home (Varani et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, this was the first attempt to introduce VR interventions in home‐PC settings, obtaining promising results: most participants (73%) declared that they would be willing to keep a VR headset at home; patients showed a 20% decrease in anxiety and depression and a significant reduction of perceived pain and fatigue symptoms. As a further outcome, ANT collected patients' preferences as the output of a focus group and semi‐structured interviews: all patients declared to prefer natural and relaxing scenarios, 36% expressed a preference for interactive videos, while 33% wanted to see videos as simple observers (Sichi et al., 2019). After these encouraging results, ANT introduced the VR headset with interactive and non‐interactive contents in its home‐care practice. VR use is not intended as a substitute for psychological support, but as an additional and complementary intervention to allow the patient to have moments of leisure and distraction from their psycho‐physical condition. Study design The proposed investigation is a randomized, controlled, non‐profit, single‐center exploratory intervention study without drugs. The study is aimed to evaluate the effect of the VR use on the psycho‐physical symptoms on cancer patients assisted by the ANT Foundation home palliative care program. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: Experimental group (VR group): patients will be given the VR headset with non‐interactive and interactive contents at home for four days Control group (CTR group): patients will be given a tablet at home for four days with relaxing non‐interactive 2D videos with natural and artistic scenarios. VR and CTR patients will undergo the same tests in the same time frame. Primary outcome ‐ Anxiety and depression levels. Secondary outcome ‐ Pain. ‐ Short‐term psychophysical symptoms. ‐ To identify the type of immersive VR content and the average VR time‐usage resulting most beneficial for the home palliative care cancer patient. Study population and setting The study population consists of cancer patients assisted by the home palliative care program of the ANT Foundation in Bologna city and surrounding areas (Italy). The study will take place directly at the patients' homes. Randomization The investigators (ANT psychologists), after having exposed the study, will ask the ANT physicians to identify patients who meet eligibility criteria among their assisted ones. The physicians will explain the study to eligible patients and, if they show interest to participate, they will be contacted by the psychologist. Patients will be randomly assigned by the Research Department of the ANT Foundation to the VR group (30 patients) or the CTR group (30 patients) by randomization using a series of random numbers generated by Excel. Investigators that will run the statistical analysis will be blinded to the randomization procedure. Procedure and measures The study will last for four days for each patient. On the first day (T0) each subject will be fully explained the study, given the specific information and asked to sign the informed consent. The psychologist, after filling the socio‐demographic and clinical data sheet, will ask the participant to answer the following set of validated questionnaires which will then be administered for the second time at the end of the 4 days of observation (T1). The procedure takes approximately 30 minutes at T0, and 10 minutes at T1. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) VR Group. After having filled the questionnaires, the investigator will show the patient how to use the VR headset, suggesting using it especially in moments of psycho‐physical discomfort. In this study, a Lenovo Mirage Solo Headset, together with the wireless Daydream motion controller, will be used. The VR headset will be kept at home by the patient for the duration of the study (i.e., four days). The VR headset will be equipped with 10 non‐interactive videos and a short interactive game. The videos are characterized by relaxing scenarios (e.g., beach, sunset over the sea), giving a "passive" use to the patient. The game is also characterized by a relaxing scenario and it will require the active interaction of the patient. At the end of the observational period, the investigator will be able to download the usage data to detect useful information, i.e., knowing if the patient has used the VR headset to view interactive or non‐interactive contents and the time of use. Before and after each use of the VR headset, the patient will be asked to fulfill the Edmontom Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), an internationally validated rating scale used to assess the impact of the main symptoms on the quality of life in patient in palliative care. The ESAS is composed by some numerical rating scales (NRS) relating to specific symptoms ranging from 0 (absence of the symptom) to 10 (worst symptom severity). The evaluated symptoms are: pain, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, lack of appetite, malaise, and shortness of breath. In order to ensure the correct completion of the ESAS scales, it will be digitally inserted directly into the VR headset, and the patient can answer by selecting the answer navigating with the controller. Without filling the scale, the patient will not be able to access to the contents. On T0, patient will be also asked to wear, for the entire duration of the study, a wearable device, the Empatica E4 wristband, that measures several physiological parameters (skin conductance, heart rate, skin temperature) associated with painful experiences and anxious symptoms. Patients will be also provided with a short paper diary in which they can record any pain or anxiety peak experienced during the day, as well as any drug taken to overcome such moments of psychophysical discomfort (e.g., painkillers, benzodiazepines). On the second day, the investigator goes back to the patient in order to download data from Empatica E4 wristband and recharge it. On day T1, patient will return the VR headset and the wristband to the investigator and will complete again the HADS and BPI questionnaires. CTR group. After having administered the questionnaires, the investigator will illustrate to the patient how to use the tablet for watching videos, suggesting using it especially in moments of psycho‐physical discomfort. The tablet will be given to the patient for the duration of the study (four days). The tablet will be equipped with 10 non‐interactive 2D videos characterized by relaxing settings with natural or artistic scenarios, giving a "passive" use to the patient. Before and after each use of the tablet, patient has to complete the ESAS digitally inserted into the tablet. Patient can answer by selecting the answer on the touchscreen. Without filling the scale, the patient will not be able to access the videos inserted in the tablet. On day T1, patient will return the tablet to the investigator and fill out the HADS and BPI questionnaires. Security precautions The risk analysis, and the subsequent control measures, are based on the device documentation provided by the manufacturer, the scientific literature and the evidence and experience gained with the Look of Life pilot study, conducted by ANT and the University of Padova. In order to cover potential risks for patients, ANT Foundation has taken out a study‐specific insurance policy. ‐ Risk from electromagnetic emissions from VR headset. We consider this risk to be an acceptable level, given the European Certification (EC) of the device. The device complies with the European Directive 2014/53/EU. Its Specific Absorbance Rate (SAR) is 0.097 W/Kg (maximum for European standards for mobile devices 2 W/Kg). ‐ Mechanical risk. When wearing the device, the user is not able to see the real surrounding space and could therefore trip or bump into objects. The instructions suggest using the headset in an environment free from obstructions such as objects and furniture. The device also gradually begins to obscure the view when the user moves more than 0.4 m from the position selected as the central position, and darkens completely beyond 0.8 m. As an additional safety measure, investigators will instruct participants to use the headset only when seated, thereby reducing the risk to an acceptable level. ‐ Nausea and motion sickness. In some cases, especially with particular contents and in predisposed subjects, VR can elicit some episodes of nausea reported in the scientific literature. However, in the pilot study conducted by ANT and University of Padova, no patient reported side effects due to the use of the VR headset. The investigator will immediately stop the study if the patient shows any episodes of nausea or motion sickness. The videos have been selected as they contain minimal stimuli that can elicit motion sickness or emotional distress. All videos and interactive content within the VR headset were created by Immerxive, a company specialized in the creation of multimedia contents, under the supervision of the ANT psychologists who had participated in the pilot study. Furthermore, suffering from nausea or motion sickness are also exclusion criteria for participation in the study. ‐ Risk of infection. The VR headset is worn in contact with the user's face, therefore it could be a vehicle for infective agents among the study participants. We will adhere to the guidelines of the regional health and social agency of Emilia Romagna (Agenzia sanitaria e sociale regionale dell'Emilia Romagna) concerning the disinfection of medical devices and equipment. We considered the headset, as it is in contact with user's face, as an oxygen therapy mask, for which the disinfection with chlorine derivatives at a concentration of 0.1% is recommended. Before each use from each subject, the VR headset will be disinfected with disposable sanitary wipes and the lenses will be cleaned with specific alcohol‐based products. The controller, the tablet for the control group, and the wristband will be also disinfected after each patient use. ‐ Seizures. Diagnosis of epilepsy, other neurological diseases and sensitivity to flashing lights are exclusion criteria for participation in the study. ‐ Eye fatigue, skin problems. ANT investigators, as already present in the device user manual, advise participants against prolonged use and indicate to wear the headset on clean and dry skin, and stop using it in case of signs of irritation, swelling, eczema, or itching. ‐ Fraudulent access to data. The headset and the tablet record information on the time of use of the device and on the assessments on the clinical scales carried out before and after each session. As a control measure, the data are stored on the device anonymously. Once the experimental phase for each subject is completed, the investigator sends a .txt file to the email address specifically set up for receiving these reports from the device restricted area (accessible only for the investigators by providing a password). Once archived, the file within the device is deleted before the next use by a new participant in the study. For both groups, patients are aware through the informed consent about the possible adverse events (i.e., nausea, dizziness, motion sickness). The investigator keeps in contact with patients for the whole study duration to immediately record any adverse event. To cover the risks of adverse event described below, ANT Foundation has subscribed a study‐specific insurance policy. Sample size The sample size was evaluated using G*power software with a‐priori power analysis for a one‐sample Mann‐Whitney‐Wilcoxon test. Considering a α = 0.05 and a power 1‐β = 0.80 with an effect size of 0.80, two groups of 27 patients each need to be enrolled for the study. Considering a 10% dropout rate, the study aims to recruit a total of 60 patients (30 patients for the VR group + 30 patients for the CTR group). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be conducted on the data after their anonymization. An investigator is in charge of anonymization and blinding to groups patients allocation. The anonymized and blinded data will be passed to the investigators in charge of data analysis. Anonymized data will be stored within the Research Department of ANT Foundation in a ad‐hoc safe electronic database. A descriptive analysis of the socio‐demographic and clinical data of the patients at T0 will be considered: age, marital status, educational qualification, occupation, neoplasm primary site, extent of the neoplasm, Karnofsky index and drugs intake. Comparison analysis on changes in anxiety, depression and pain will be performed using mixed‐effects models or non‐parametric statistical tests (e.g., Mann‐Whitney‐Wilcoxon). Similarly, changes in short‐term psychophysical symptomatology before and after the use of the VR headset/tablet will be evaluated using mixed‐effects models. The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the subject, the type of VR content and the usage times will be carried out by adding covariates to the mixed‐effects models. The analysis will follow the "intention to treat" analysis. Time line The project is scheduled on 3 phases: ‐ Phase 1 (1 month) ‐ Training and patients selection ‐ After the registration of the study protocol, the investigators (ANT psychologists) will explain to the ANT physicians the rationale, the protocol, the eligibility criteria of the study and will verify with each of them the presence of patients that can be enrolled. ‐ Phase 2 (8 months) ‐ Recruitment and data collection ‐ Each physician will contact eligible patients and ask them to participate. If the patient agrees, the physician will provide the patient contact data to the psychologist who will contact him/her. The psychologist will bring the VR headset or the tablet to the patient's home and will enrol the patient in the study. ‐ Phase 3 (4 months) ‐ Statistical analysis and publication ‐ The data collected will be statistically processed by the Research Department of the ANT Foundation for publication in scientific journals of the sector. The publication of the trial results will follow the CONSORT checklist. Data management ‐ Data from electronic clinical scale assessment. Patients from both group are asked to fulfil the Edmonton Symptoms Assessment Scale before and after each use of the device. These data are stored locally in the device, and then sent to a pre‐specified email address specifically generated for this purpose. ANT investigator can access to the data within the device by entering in the restricted area with a password. ‐ Data from Empatica E4 wristband. Physiological signals recorded by the smart wristband are recorded and stored locally. At day 2 and day 4, the investigator download data to the Empatica proprietary cloud platform and then locally ‐ Electronic records. Fulfilled questionnaires at T0 and T1 (HADS and BPI) and information about information by the Case Report Form (CRF) are reported digitally in a folder shared with all the investigators. Data are completely anonymised.

N2  -  Background To date, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic and serious disorder with an increasing prevalence in many developed countries. OSA is characterized by dynamic imbalance between airway patency and collapse during sleep leading recurrent airway obstruction (partial or complete) and repetitive apneas and hypopneas. OSA results in gas exchange abnormalities, cortical arousals, autonomic arousals, sleep fragmentation, and systemic fragmentation. Notably, OSA has a prevalence of up to 5% in children and 50% in obese children. OSA is associated with various co‐morbidities which affect multiple organ systems, resulting in acute events or long‐term sequelae, and consequently incurring considerable social, economic, and health costs. For example, pediatric OSA can induce hypertension, cardiovascular disorder, metabolic syndrome, growth retardation, learning problem, night enuresis, and attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Persistent OSA severity is associated with the decreased quality of life of patients' families and increased concern regarding financial burden. In children, behavioral impairment, neurocognitive dysfunction, and reduced scholastic achievements are now well‐characterized morbidities of OSA. In addition, parentally reported daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity, and aggressive behaviors can also develop, albeit to a lesser extent in children who habitually snore but in the absence of OSA. Degrees of discipline problems and poor attention span were significantly higher in OSA children compared with non‐OSA controls. However, a recent meta‐analysis found that there were few studies with low risk of bias (levels of evidence I and II) showed that OSA children's intellectual abilities may be impaired but remain within the normal range. Capdevila et al (2008) recognized that 'the major intriguing component of the association between OSA and cognitive functioning lies in the observation that not all children with OSA actually manifest cognitive morbidities.'. Nevertheless, which specific cognitive ability (language, memory, attention, executive function) drives poor academic performance is unclear. Therefore, we must test OSA patients using measures that allow for fractionated higher‐ and lower‐order cognitive abilities based on accepted cognitive neuropsychology models and find other factors may be recreating a role of OSA‐associated neurobehavioral consequences. OSA severity is potentially associated with genetic and environmental determinants of susceptibility in children. Increased body mass index (BMI), having the potential to central obesity, is one of the most important risk factors for OSA and is more strongly associated with neurocognitive and behavioral problems in children than OSA alone. Inﬂammation is associated with increased risk for neurocognitive deficits in children with obesity and/or OSA. Although obesity could influence academic performance, there was insufficient evidence to support a direct link between obesity and poor academic performance in school age children and change in weight status was not associated with change in cognitive function in children with obesity. Therefore, current evidences support that obesity has the potential to be a marker rather than a cause of low academic performance. Furthermore, the ε4 allele of the APOE gene is associated with increased risk of OSA and poorer cognition in children. However, APOE ε4 status alone was associated with memory, not language/executive functioning, in later life in a longitudinal study. Pediatric OSA is associated with sympathetic outflow in terms of overnight increases in urinary concentrations of catecholamines whereas increased urinary levels of γ‐aminobutyric acid and decreased urinary level of taurine could underlie mechanisms of neuronal excitotoxicity and dysfunction. Both pediatric OSA and cognitive deficits might be to be predicted by overnight changes in urinary concentrations of selected neurotransmitters. However, those findings could not generalize to other disease entity. Incorporation of environmental elements such as nutrition, recurrent exposure to respiratory viruses, passive or active exposure to cigarette smoking, intensity of intellectual activity, and socioeconomic status is important in children because all these can affect both the pathophysiological risk for OSA as well as modify the susceptibility to the consequences of OSA. Unfortunately, there is still no consensus if we should consider OSA as a single disease with different phenotypes with or without neurocognitive deficits, or if there are different diseases with different genetic determinants, pathogenic mechanisms, prognosis, and treatment. Most of this important information is not routinely collected during clinical assessment of children with habitual snoring in ENT clinics. ADHD, characterized by symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/ impulsivity, often emerges during the preschool years and remains impairing throughout the life span. ADHD is among the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting approximately 8%‐12% of children worldwide. Prevalence of ADHD in preschoolers, recently estimated to be 2.1%, is lower than that of school‐age children and adolescents. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM‐5) identifies 3 types of ADHD: primarily hyperactive‐impulsive, primarily inattentive, and combined type. There is a body of evidence emerging that indicates that hyperactivity‐impulsivity declines in preschoolers with ADHD, and inattention increases or at least becomes more evident when children enter structured school settings. ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, in terms of the multifactorial etiological risk factors, diverse expressions of the symptom domains, comorbid disorders, neuropsychological impairments, and long‐term trajectories. Both sleep and behavior problems are common in preschool and school‐aged children. Notably, lower quality of sleep in infancy significantly predicts compromised attention regulation and behavior problems at 3‐4 years of age. In our previous studies, we identified that pediatric OSA is closely associated with ADHD. In pediatric OSA, 32% and 35% had concomitant ADHD in children aged 4 to 5 years and those aged 6 to 11 years, respectively. In contrast, a full sleep assessment in children with ADHD found 50% of them had OSA that caused chronic sleep deprivation and could be considered as a signature of ADHD. Alterations in the genes encoding for molecules involved in catecholamine signaling that weaken nor epinephrine production may impair the prefrontal cortex (PFC) circuits mediating the regulation of attention and behavior. Inadequate catecholamine release is associated with fatigue and ADHD, and therapeutic doses of ADHD medications likely normalize catecholamine transmission in patients with inadequate norepinephrine and dopamine levels, or both, thus bringing PFC function to more optimal levels. Prescription stimulants such as methylphenidate and non‐stimulants such as atomoxetine are labeled for the treatment of ADHD from age approximately 6 and above years. Although there was no evidence of increased serious cardiovascular risk in children with ADHD exposed to ADHD medications, ADHD medications have been shown to increase blood pressure, heart rate, and QT interval in children. Halperin and Marks (2019) concluded that acute treatments of ADHD have demonstrable efficacy, but do not appear to fundamentally alter underlying mechanism. For example, improvement of pediatric OSA after adenotonsillectomy results in improvement of behavior problems during short‐term follow‐up and long‐term follow‐up. Recently, a combination of atomoxetine (norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and oxybutynin (antimuscarinic agent) administered orally before bedtime on 1 night greatly reduced adulthood OSA severity, and these findings also open new possibilities for the pharmacologic treatment for pediatric OSA with ADHD. A range of acute processes, including hypoxia/re‐oxygenation, repeated arousals, and episodic hypercarbia, may be corresponding to changes in some regional brain tissue integrity in pediatric OSA. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using voxel‐based morphometry (VBM) analysis has been used to explore possible sources of behavioral impairment and neurocognitive dysfunction in pediatric OSA. Reduced gray matter volume and increased and reduced regional cortical thicknesses can help to understand the underlying pathology. Using a measure of local changes in signal intensity patterns from high‐resolution MRIs, sleep scientists can assess the entropy tissue texture to investigate brain tissue integrity which reflects the nature and extent of injury or structural adaptation in pediatric OSA subjects. In OSA children, several brain sites including the PFC, middle and posterior corpus callosum, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellar areas showed reduced entropy values, indicating tissue changes suggestive of acute insults. Kheirandish‐Gozal et al (2018) concluded that children suffering from OSA display predominantly acute tissue injury in neural regions principally localized within autonomic, respiratory, cognitive, and neuropsychologic control, functions that correspond to previously‐reported comorbidities associated with OSA. Patients with ADHD have symptoms similar to those caused by lesions to the right PFC. Imaging studies have shown reduced size and reduced functional activity of the right PFC causing difficulties with top‐down attention regulation in patients with ADHD. The PFC requires an optimal level of norepinephrine and dopamine for proper function: either too little (as when we are drowsy or fatigued) or too much (as when we are stressed) markedly impairs PFC regulation of behavior and thought. However, multiple functional and structural neural network abnormalities beyond the classical fronto‐striatal model, including fronto‐parieto‐temporal, fronto‐cerebellar and even fronto‐limbic networks, have been found via functional MRI in ADHD subjects. Furthermore, diffusion MRI including a technology of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect atypical fractional anisotropy (FA) to understand brain white matter integrity has been applied in OSA and ADHD (both diseases had lower FA in the corpus callosum at baseline) and compare the effect of medical treatment (continuous positive airway pressure for OSA: increased FA in the hippocampus, temporal lobes, fusiform gyrus, and occipital lobes; methylphenidate for ADHD: increased FA in the corpus callosum. Obviously, these MRI studies indicated that a closely neuropathological association between OSA and ADHD. While both OSA and ADHD are lifelong disorders in many patients, however, there is no study reporting differences in brain MRI (in terms of brain tissue integrity and diffusion) between OSA children with ADHD and OSA children without ADHD and between baseline and after adenotonsillectomy in our literature review. Therefore, voxel‐based morphometry and fractional anisotropy of the brain can be assessed by structure MRI (T1 images) for measuring volumetric alternations of gray and white matter, resting‐state functional MRI for assessing functional connectivity, and diffusion MRI for evaluating white matter integrity in children with OSA with or without ADHD. Since children with OSA have lower entropy in neural regions involving autonomic control and children with ADHD have a hypofunction of the PFC, changes in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) due to OSA and ADHD span have been studied. In children with OSA and hypoxemia, an increase in sympathetic tone during sleep was found. Despite the levels of overnight urinary noradrenaline and adrenaline are increased and changes occur in the sympathetic tone in children with OSA, pediatric OSA do not usually develop high blood pressure (BP). It's not easy to use to monitor 24‐h BP to dynamically evaluate the ANS conditions. However, changes in the function of ANS also modify children's heart rate variability (HRV). The sympathetic activation and decreased parasympathetic suppression can increase heart rate. The PFC, which is vital for attention, motor control, emotional regulation and higher order autonomic control, is hypofunctional in OSA and ADHD. PFC activity has been associated with changes to HRV via mediation of the cortico‐subcortical pathways that regulate the parasympathetic and sympathetic branches of the ANS. PFC hypoactivity decreases parasympathetic tone and increases contributions from the sympathetic nervous system. Using the time domain analysis, children with habitual snoring (apnea‐hypopnea index [AHI] <1 events/h) showed signiﬁcantly lower values of the proportion of NN50 divided by the total number of NN (R‐R) intervals (pNN50; mostly reﬂect the parasympathetic component) comparing with the control children in all sleep stages; children with OSA showed signiﬁcantly lower values of pNN50 comparing with the control children in all sleep stages 1‐hr study of daytime HRV; children with ADHD had reduced pNN50 compared with controls. Reduced vagal tone and neurobehavioral consequences supported that disrupted autonomic regulation seen in children with OSA and ADHD may be central in origin. Using the frequency domain analysis, an increase in low‐frequency/high‐frequency ratio (LF/HF; reﬂects the sympathovagal balance to the heart) for N2 sleep stage and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep was found in the chronic snorer group compared to the non‐snoring control group and increased LF/HF in children with ADHD. However, an increase in LF/HF ratio was seen at overnight or 24‐hr studies in adults with OSA (AHI ≥5 events/h) suggestive of increased sympathetic modulation whereas a decrease in LF/HF ratio in all sleep stages in children with moderate‐to‐severe OSA (obstructive AHI [OAHI] >5) compared with the control group (OAHI ≤1). Furthermore, the most recent study indicated that age and autonomic control, rather than cerebral oxygenation and OSA severity, were predictive of electroencephalograph (EEG) spectral power in children whereas autonomic cardiovascular control and cerebral oxygenation were associated with EEG spectral power in adults. Nevertheless, both the HR and LF/HF decreased and the SDNN increased after adenotonsillectomy in all stages of sleep in children with OSA. Therefore, these changes in parameters that reﬂect parasympathetic modulation are more easily detectable in pediatric OSA and ADHD than sympathetic modulation. Measurement of HRV shows information on the functional state of the ANS. HRV is a physiological phenomenon of variation in the time interval between heartbeats. Depressed or reduced HRV primarily means that the HR is monotonously regular, and it means a lowered of the ANS regulatory function and ability to keep homeostasis, cope with internal and external stressors, and resist disease or recover in proper time. Significant advances in software programs to automatically derive HRV have led to its extensive use in psychophysiological research. In general, HF (0.15‐0.4 Hz) represents parasympathetic activity whereas LF (0.04‐0.15 Hz) represents sympathetic and parasympathetic activities and LF% represents sympathetic activity. Although there are standardized autonomic tests and well‐established ranges of normal values in adults, there is limited normal values for HRV parameters in children Among the time‐domain indices, there was strong to excellent correspondence for SDNN, RMSSD, and pNN50 to ensure measurement fidelity across signal processing software programs and reproducibility of 24‐h HRV. The frequency‐domain indices yielded excellent correspondence for LF, HF, and LF/HF ratio, except for VLF which exhibited poor correspondence. Stringent user‐decisions and technical specifications for nuanced HRV processing details are essential to ensure measurement fidelity across signal processing software programs. Because median heart rate decreases from 113 beats per min (bpm) by 2 years of age to 73 bpm by 15‐18 years of age and median respiratory rate decreases from 31 breaths/min by 2 years of age to 16 bpm by 15‐18 years of age, it is plausible that these controversial results of LF/HF during sleep in children may be due to 'adult‐based measurements of HRV'. Kuo et al (2008) has developed an analytic software of HRV measurement (combined with polysomnography or alone) that uses the adjustable time segments (16 sec‐300 sec) which allow to more sensitively and specifically quantify HRV in different sleep stages and active waking‐quiet sleep transitions for rats and human. Using a wearable ECG patch, we can perform a real‐time, whole‐day HRV analysis to deal with short N‐N intervals and breath‐breath intervals in children. This HRV analytic program opens new possibilities for the optimal determination of autonomic function for children. The high prevalence and impact on daily life of pediatric OSA necessitate clinicians to offer effective and acceptable treatment options. However, recent evidence has raised questions about the benefits of adenotonsillectomy in curing OSA for children. Although adenotonsillectomy significantly increased sleep efficiency and oxygen saturation and decreased stage 1 sleep, AHI, obstructive apnea index (OAI), and arousal index, only 27%‐79% of pediatric OSA had complete resolution of OSA (post‐operative AHI <1 events/h). Beyond the AHI, we previously found that adenotonsillectomy can improve behavior, elevated BP, ADHD severity, inflammation, and OSA‐related quality of life. In contrast, the attention and executive‐function score on the Developmental Neuropsychological Assessment (with scores ranging from 50 to 150 and higher scores indicating better functioning), was close to the population mean of 100, and the change from baseline to follow‐up did not differ significantly between the early‐adenotonsillectomy group and the watchful‐waiting group. In our latest case‐control study, baseline AHI significantly differed between the non‐obese with non‐severe OSA (nO‐nS) and non‐obese with severe OSA (nO‐S) subgroups, between the nO‐nS and obese with severe OSA (O‐S) subgroups, between the nO‐S and obese with non‐severe OSA (O‐nS) subgroups, and between the O‐nS and O‐S subgroups at baseline. After adenotonsillectomy, AHI significantly decreased in the nO‐nS, nO‐S, and O‐S subgroups. Therefore, post‐operative AHI only significantly differed between the nO‐nS and O‐S subgroups. OSA‐18 scores were equal in all the 4 subgroups either at baseline or after adenotonsillectomy whereas OSA‐18 scores significantly reduced after adenotonsillectomy in all the 4 subgroups. Interestingly, although adenotonsillectomy did not reduced AHI, this operation still significantly reduced OSA‐18 score which was close to the means of the other 3 subgroups. Again, these findings suggested that improvement of behavior and quality of life was not necessarily parallel to the improvement of AHI. Therefore, our results further call for attention to investigate the effect of adenotonsillectomy on other polysomnographic parameters, brain MRI, and autonomic function in pediatric OSA (with or without ADHD). Study objectives In this prospective study, the objectives are: 1. to investigate the differences in pediatric brain tissue integrity, autonomic function, attention, behavior, quality‐of‐life, and sleep factors between the OSA with ADHD group, the OSA without ADHD group, and the healthy control group in a cross‐sectional study; 2. to evaluate the efficacy of adenotonsillectomy versus watchful waiting with supportive care, with respect to the same variables of interest in a randomized controlled trial; 3. to evaluate whether the relative efficacy of the treatment differs according to baseline ADHD, weight, or OSA severity; and 4. to develop a predictive model for surgical success rate using both conventional well‐known factors and MRI/HRV biomarkers.

N2  -  Background: Whether statins reliably reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains controversial. We sought to determine the impact of statin use on new‐onset postdischarge POAF in the Post‐Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH‐AF) CardioLink‐1 randomized controlled trial. Methods: We randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2‐VASc score ≥ 2) and no history of preoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) to 30‐day continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched‐based device or to usual care. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cumulative AF and/or atrial flutter lasting for ≥ 6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring, or AF and/or atrial flutter documented by a 12‐lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. Results: The 260 patients (77.4%) discharged on statins were more likely to be male (P = 0.018) and to have lower CHA2DS2‐VASc scores (P = 0.011). Patients treated with statins at discharge had a 2‐fold lower rate of POAF than those who were not treated with statins in the entire cohort (18.4% vs 8.1%, log‐rank P = 0.0076). On multivariable Cox regression including the CHA2DS2‐VASc score adjustment, statin use was associated with a lower risk of POAF (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.25‐0.98, P = 0.043). Use of statins at a higher intensity was associated with lower risk of POAF, suggestive of a dose–response effect (log‐rank Ptrend = 0.0082). Conclusions: The use of statins was associated with a reduction in postdischarge POAF risk among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The routine use of high‐intensity statin to prevent subacute POAF after discharge deserves further study.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION Study Rationale Hypertension (HTN) is the major contributor to the global burden of disease and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Peru. Completion of the proposed randomized trial will provide compelling and robust evidence on the acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity, and sustainability of the multicomponent ANDES intervention that is aimed at reducing blood pressure and improving diabetes control in patients from high‐risk and under‐resourced communities in Puno, Peru. These data are urgently needed to inform policies in low‐ and middle‐income countries on the health gains that can be achieved by multicomponent implementation strategies to reduce hypertension. Background HTN affects 1.4 billion people worldwide, yet in low‐and middle‐income countries (LMICs) the vast majority of patients are unaware and untreated, often until the occurrence of devastating complications (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke). HTN is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Peru. Overall age‐ and sex‐standardized prevalence of pre‐HTN and HTN among Peruvian adults is 24% and 19%, respectively1. Rates of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke mortality are 87 and 27 per 100,000 Peruvians (aged 30‐69 yrs), respectively, with greater prevalence in men2. Pre‐HTN and HTN are higher in rural‐ vs. urban‐dwelling Puno residents (44 vs 31%, mean age 55 years)3. The PERU MIGRANT study found HTN awareness, treatment, and control rates of 48%, 40%, and 30%, respectively; but only 5% of HTN being treated and controlled4‐6. The Puno CRONICAS study cohort found HTN control rates of 19% and 1% among urban vs. rural dwellers, respectively7. Thus, very low HTN control rates in Peru represent an important health care gap. In Peru, indigenous Andean communities (i.e, Aymara and Quechua) represent a population with a high prevalence of HTN and T2D (18.5% and 7.4% respectively for those ≥55 years old); yet access to chronic care is virtually non‐existent despite the availability of efficacious and affordable treatment. To address this gap, we propose to develop and test the Addressing HyperteNsion and Diabetes through Community‐Engaged Systems in Puno, Peru (ANDES) strategy for HTN/T2D diagnosis, and HTN treatment and control, which will be designed for remote settings where health care has low penetration. Trial Design & Objectives ANDES is a two‐arm, individually randomized superiority trial with parallel assignment. The overall objective of ANDES is to evaluate the effectiveness of a home‐based Health Agent‐led intervention in reducing blood pressure and improving diabetes control in patients from under‐resourced communities in Puno, Peru. Health agents are community health workers (CHWs) and/or nurse technicians that act as liaisons between the public health system and community members. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTIONS, OUTCOMES This study will be conducted in Puno, Peru, a remote region in the Andean 'high plains' that suffers a high burden of HTN/T2D and where access to health care is limited. Puno is the capital of the Puno Region and the Puno Province (2017 census pop: 1,172,697) located in southeastern Peru, at 3,825 meters (13,500 feet) above sea level. The population is primarily indigenous, consisting of Quechua (pop: 537,972) and Aymara (pop: 318,363) Andean people, which together comprise 72% of the population. Puno city, the urban provincial capital (150,000 residents) borders the shores of Lake Titicaca and northern Bolivia. Rural Puno comprises 14 large districts with each district having up to 20 communities. The public health system in Puno is managed by the Regional Health Administration (Direccion Regional de Salud, or DIRESA), under the Peruvian Ministry of Health (Ministerio de Salud, or MINSA), the governing body that leads, regulates, and promotes national health policy. ANDES Implementation Strategy The "ANDES multicomponent implementation strategy" is an adaptation of the World Health Organization (WHO) HEARTS package26 and consists of the following components: ‐ Health agent‐managed home care ‐ BP monitoring ‐ Health coaching ‐ Health system navigation ‐ Medication delivery assistance ‐ Text message‐based health coaching Specifically, the ANDES strategy is aligned with four WHO HEARTS technical package components. HEALTH AGENT‐managed home care As part of the ANDES implementation strategy, ANDES intervention participants will be provided BP monitoring and health coaching by health agents in their home. Additionally, all participants will be assessed for T2D by having their HbA1c measured after study enrollment. All participants deemed to have T2D will also receive T2D monitoring via HbA1c by a research staff member. Health coaching is defined as "multiple sessions for patient‐centered health education and motivation delivered with the goal of facilitating lifestyle modification and/or medication adherence."27 See section 4.2 for a description of BP and HbA1c monitoring. (Note: all participants will also have their BP and HbA1c monitored by a separate team of research fieldworkers at baseline, 6‐, 12‐, and 18‐month follow‐up visits. See Section 4.1 for a detailed schedule of activities.) During twice monthly home visits during the first six months and monthly thereafter for the rest of the year, community health agents will meet one‐on‐one with intervention participants, during which they will complete the following activities: 1. Review personal goals and visit agenda; 2. Conduct health assessments: ‐ BP 3. Health Coaching: 1. Assess the participant's HTN health plan and collect medication adherence data and health services access data 2. Provide health education and counseling: ‐ Provide educational materials, medical appointment log, weekly pill organizer and calendar ‐ Review behavioral strategies to lower BP (e.g., diet and particularly salt consumption, physical activity, weight management, stress management, sleep, and alcohol use28) ‐ Review barriers to improving BP as well as strategies to overcome them. 4. Provide healthcare system navigation support: ‐ Work with patients to set up, prepare for, and attend doctor's appointments. ‐ Empower the patient to advocate for their own health care and emphasize their roles and responsibilities as a member of their healthcare team. 5. Provide medication delivery assistance A complete visit will be determined by the ability of a health agent to cover appropriate issues from the list above. We have developed a checklist as a guide for the health agents to follow. This guide will also be used to evaluate fidelity to the multicomponent strategy. Text messages As part of the multi‐component strategy developed by ANDES for HTN detection and management, a text messaging system was developed directed to patients, their families, and health agents. Text messages provide reminders, education, and orientation for stakeholders to encourage healthy behaviors, thus improving chronic disease management and health outcomes29. The ANDES texting component is directed to patients, their families, and health agents. In all cases, messages have been tailored to fit with the characteristics of the population, taking into consideration local foods, belief systems, and traditions. The main objective of patient messages is to promote healthy behaviors such as reducing salt consumption, increasing physical activity, and increasing consumption of fruits and vegetables. Messaging will also encourage medical adherence by sending reminders to refill their medication and attend their medical appointments. Text messages directed to families are meant to educate them in regards to hypertension management and enforce healthy habits in the household of the ANDES hypertensive patient. We believe families are strong allies when trying to improve hypertensive patients' health. Finally, the main objective of messages directed to health agents is to communicate weekly reminders regarding topics of discussion with their patients. Messages will also motivate and provide positive reinforcement to health agents for their dedication to the patients and support of the intervention. Recruitment Potential ANDES study participants will be identified, screened, and recruited via 2 different mechanisms: 1) community health fairs and 2) healthcare facility‐based enrollment. Health Fairs. Health fairs are 1‐day events offering HTN/T2D screening in Puno, Peru. Health fair planning, including the selection of the date, times, and location of health fairs will be conducted in collaboration with DIRESA & EsSalud and local healthcare facility leaders. Outreach campaigns and advertisements (e.g., local radio announcements, posters, fliers) will encourage all adult community members (18+ years) to attend health fair events. All health fair attendees will be asked to complete a Screening Case Report Form (CRF), which includes blood pressure measurements and T2D screening (HbA1c). (See below for Screening CRF details.) Healthcare facility‐based enrollment. Participating healthcare facilities will provide study staff lists of HTN patients. ANDES research study staff will review lists and contact patients (via phone or home visit) to inquire about their willingness for an in‐person screening visit at their home. During the screening visit, study staff will confirm if the contact information is correct (i.e., if they have to correct patient phone number or address) and administer the Screening CRF and associated health assessments, as done at health fairs (See Section 3.5.2 for details). The Screening CRF is used to determine the eligibility of participants captured by health fairs and facility‐based enrollment. The Screening CRF confirms each inclusion and exclusion criteria via the following methods: 1. Participant age is verified by government document. They must be at least 18 years old. 2. The following criteria are verified by participant report: place of residence within the study area, no plans to move during study period, willingness and availability to attend baseline visit, not currently or planning to become pregnant, and no other member of their household already a participant in ANDES. 3. Ambulatory status is based on patient report and observation by ANDES staff. 4. HTN status is based on patient report and the following criteria: ‐ If the participant reports a HTN diagnosis and DOES have a current prescription, they will move directly to the Informed Consent Process if interested in the study. ‐ If the participant reports a HTN diagnosis but DOES NOT have a current prescription, one of the following scenarios will occur: i. If their blood pressure is ≥ 140/90 mmHg (measured by study staff), they will be referred to a healthcare facility to be re‐evaluated. If they are diagnosed with hypertension and/or provided a prescription, they will then proceed to the Informed Consent Process. ii. If their blood pressure is < 140/90 mmHg, they will not proceed to Informed Consent Process. They will be thanked for their time and be offered counseling on hypertension and health habits. ‐ If the participant has a blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg and DOES NOT report a past diagnosis or current prescription, they will be referred to a healthcare facility to be evaluated. If they receive a diagnosis of HTN and/or are provided a prescription, they will then proceed to the Informed Consent Process. Recruitment will be rolling over 24 months during which 1068 participants in total (534 participants per arm) will be enrolled. See Sample Size Consideration for details (Section 5.1). Informed consent will be obtained from all study participants using standard procedures. ANDES is a randomized, two‐arm intervention individually randomized trial with parallel assignment. Healthcare centers were selected based on activities conducted during formative research. We will consider each healthcare center as a stratum and will create stratum‐stratified permuted blocks to balance the intervention across the different types of healthcare centers. ANDES will use rolling enrollment with 45 participants per month who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. All participants will be followed longitudinally for 18 months. To maintain balance of treatment assignments, the sample will be stratified by healthcare center. Following enrollment and a baseline assessment (Visit 0), ANDES participants will initiate one of two care pathways according to the randomization assignment. Participants in the usual care group will be referred to their local healthcare facility for evaluation and/or to receive medical therapy per typical standard of care and at the discretion of the treating physician for the entirety of the ANDES study. Participants in the ANDES intervention group will receive the ANDES implementation package consisting of health agent home visits and a text messaging program for 12 consecutive months. Implementation package delivery will end after month 12, at which time intervention participants will be advised to obtain standard care from their local healthcare facility. Study outcome measures will be obtained in both the usual care and ANDES intervention group at months 6, 12, and 18 post‐randomization. All participants will receive a total of four visits for study outcome assessments (at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months). Intervention participants will additionally receive a total of 18 visits by health agents as part of the intervention package, for a total of 22 visits for those assigned to the intervention group. No financial incentives will be offered; participants can withdraw from the study at any time without loss of healthcare benefits they would otherwise be eligible to receive (i.e., usual care). Nonetheless, based on our experience with prior studies in Peru, and specifically in the Puno area, we anticipate limited attrition (≤ 10%). Health Screening The following health assessments will be conducted by fieldworkers hired and trained by the ANDES study team. Blood pressure measurements: A member of our research team will measure resting blood pressure in the right arm in triplicate (with at least 1 minute between measurements) using an automatic oscillometric sphygmomanometer (Omron, model HEM‐907XL) at the participant's home using procedures detailed in the "Blood Pressure Measurement ‐ Standard Operating Procedures" document. Briefly, the participant will refrain from exercise, consumption/use of tobacco products, alcohol or caffeinated beverages, or cooking using biomass in the 30 minutes prior, and confirm that they do not have a full bladder. Clothing will be removed to expose the right upper‐arm and an appropriately sized cuff will be positioned as outlined in the "Standard Operating Procedure: Blood Pressure and Glucose" document. Before starting the measurement, the participant will be instructed to sit on a chair in a quiet room for five minutes with legs uncrossed, back supported by the chair, and arm supported on a table at the level of the heart (mid‐sternum). Heart rate will also be recorded. The participant will refrain from talking or from engaging in other activities such as reading or using their cell phone in the five minutes prior to and during the blood pressure measurements. We will take the average of all three measurements for SBP and DBP as the final measurement. Uncontrolled hypertension is defined as an average SBP ≥140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥90 mm Hg. Participants in the intervention group will have their blood pressure assessed by community health agents twice monthly for the first six months, and monthly thereafter for the rest of the year. Blood pressure assessment will follow the same procedure as described above. Diabetes assessment. The presence of type 2 diabetes will be determined by use of an FDA‐approved laboratory based HbA1c testing (Roche cobas c311 analyzer) as a secondary aim to assess whether the multicomponent intervention has any effect on diabetes control. A measurement will be taken from each participant at the time of the baseline, 6‐, 12‐, and 18‐month visits. A trained member of our research staff will perform a minimally invasive finger stick to collect up to 30 µl of whole blood; the sample will then be taken for testing at a central health facility laboratory. Alternatively, patients will have the opportunity to go to the central health facility to have the test performed independently of the home visit. All samples will be destroyed after testing. T2D diagnosis will be defined as ongoing treatment with a hypoglycemic drug or insulin, or a HbA1c ≥7%. If the patient has a diagnosis of T2D, documentation will be obtained from the healthcare facility. Anthropometry: We will assess height with a stadiometer (seca 213, seca, Hamburg, Germany) and waist size with a circumference tape (seca circumference tape 203, Hamburg, Germany) at baseline. We will assess weight using a digital balance (seca 803, seca, Hamburg, Germany) at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. These measurements will be conducted by our research staff. All anthropometric measurements will be measured in triplicate and mean value will be used as the final anthropometric measurement. We will follow standard procedures for the assessment of anthropometry. Oxyhemoglobin saturation: We will assess oxyhemoglobin saturation using the Rad 5v (Masimo, Irvine CA) pulse oximeter. These measurements will be conducted by our research staff. Participants will be at rest for 2 minutes before oxyhemoglobin saturation. We will record values of oxygen saturation at 60, 90 and 120 seconds. The mean value will be used as the final oxyhemoglobin saturation. Participants in the usual care group will not receive the same benefits as those in the intervention group, which include delivery medications, assistance with appointment and intensive health coaching. To offset this difference, we will offer the following clinical exams will be offered to all trial participants as an additional benefit to address their overall non‐communicable disease risk: Lung function: Spirometry will be offer to all participants at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. These measurements will be conducted by our research staff. Spirometry will be conducted by trained staff before and after inhaled bronchodilation (400 mcg of salbutamol using a spacer) following standard American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines. We will use the EasyOne Air handheld spirometer (ndd, Zurich, Switzerland), a device that has been validated and used in several large population‐based studies in low‐income settings by our group. We will adapt a standardized grading system for quality control, review, and interpretation. All lung function tests will be read by a pulmonologist on the research team as part of the quality control/quality assurance procedures. We will record pre‐ and post‐bronchodilator Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF), Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1), and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). If a spirometry measurement does not meet quality standards of acceptability or reproducibility, we will attempt to repeat the procedure on a different day for a maximum of 3 tests in total. Participants with any spirometry abnormalities will be referred to the nearest health center. Ambulatory blood pressure: We will offer ambulatory blood pressure measurement at 6, 12, and 18 months. These measurements will be conducted by our research staff. We will measure 24‐hour BP by fitting participants with a CE/ISO approved 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor [Contec Medical Systems Co., Ltd, Qinhuangdao, China] oscillometric device with an appropriate cuff for mid‐upper arm circumference (small, 20‐24 cm; medium, 24‐32 cm; large, 32‐38 cm). The 24‐hour ambulatory blood pressure monitors will be fitted on a regular working day (i.e., a day during which participants would be undertaking their regular daily activities). Blood pressure will be automatically measured at 30 minute intervals over the 24 hour period. Personal exposure to PM2.5: We will offer air quality assessment at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. These measurements will be conducted by our research staff. We will collect 24‐our personal exposures of PM2.5 using the UPAS device (Access Sensor Technologies, Fort Collins, CO). The UPAS is a small, lightweight wearable device that is easy to use and has built‐in technology for gravimetric (filter‐based) sampling. Long battery life and GPS tracking help ensure that data is collected and that the participant is wearing the device over the specified time interval, and the device can quickly be deployed between locations without having to return to a lab environment between tests for calibration. Study Staff Training Health agents will receive training on all study procedures and counseling techniques, including educational and motivational counseling techniques, BP measurement, finger stick, medication management, and behavioral change related to hypertension. The training program has been designed by the ANDES team and is based on materials from the Pan‐American Health Organization's HEARTS technical package. These materials are validated for use in Spanish, as the health agents are all Spanish speakers and will be coaching most of their patients in Spanish as well. Health agents are instructed and assessed on how to properly take clinical measures under supervision of licensed professionals and study staff. Upon completion of this training, the ANDES team will issue the health agent a certificate indicating that they are able to perform clinical measures and healthy lifestyle coaching on behalf of the ANDES Study. Fieldworkers hired by the research team will be trained on all study procedures relevant to the collection of study outcome data, including BP measurement, finger stick, spirometry, ambulatory blood pressure, personal exposure to PM2.5, and CRF administration. These fieldworkers will be responsible for collecting outcome measures to be used in analysis. They will be instructed to remain blinded to each participant's group. Sample Size To detect a difference in systolic blood pressure of 2.5 mmHg between intervention and control arms with 95% confidence, 90% power and a standard deviation of 12 mmHg, we would need 485 participants per arm. Assuming a conservative lost‐to‐follow‐up of 10% at 12 months, we would need to randomize 1068 participants in total (534 participants per arm).

N2  -  With population aging and increasing prevalence of obesity in China, the number of patients with diabetes mellitus, healthcare expenditure and mortality related to DM are forecast to grow substantially. 114 million diabetic patients and 11.6% incidence rate of diabetes yield enormous chronic disease management pressure. China medical resources are not sufficient for the great diabetes epidemic (1‐5) . The data from a multicenter, cross‐sectional survey of outpatients conducted in 606 hospitals across China showed that the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes did not achieve the goal of HbA1c <7.0% (6). We are facing problems including inadequate patient education, unable to track the entire diabetic course, and the lack of effective patient engagement in‐between clinic visits(1‐5). Diabetes management and education can improve patients' quality of life, reduce incidence and mortality of diabetic complications and relieve the medical economy burden for the government. (7). International guidelines published by American Diabetes Association and the National Institute and Health and Care Excellence in Hong Kong imply that a chronic disease service delivery model that incorporates continuous follow‐ups, DSMES (diabetes self‐management education and support) with a multidisciplinary team of health professionals to provide ongoing treatments, patient education, and scheduled health assessments for monitoring of disease control and complications has promoted internationally as a more holistic and cost‐effective way to manage patients with diabetes(8‐12) . To help health professionals to improve medical efficiency and help patients develop healthy lifestyle, we established Shared Care diabetes management model and believe that it can provide a solution. Shared Care Model aims to empower patients with diabetes self‐management education and supports (DSMES), achieve better health outcomes and delay incidence and mortality of diabetic complications. Compared with traditional diabetes outpatient settings, patients of Shared Care return to the hospital for regular follow‐up every three months, and meet with a multidisciplinary team includes diabetes educators, nurses, dietitians and physical therapist led by the physician. The patients download the Shared Care mobile application during the outpatient service and connect with the smart‐glucometer Bg1 to upload blood glucose dairy in real time. With patient's informed consent, his or her data from each visit will be collected and recorded for analysis. The internet, IOT (internet of Things) and other information technology enables the Shared Care model to integrate outpatient and remote patient management, online and face‐to‐face medical services and provide patients with comprehensive health care. Our health care extended beyond the hospital. After the patient returns home from the clinic, they can communicate through the APP with online diabetes educators. The educators answer patients' questions, give suggestions on patients' diet and summarize patients' issues to physicians, who provide high level supervision. The model enables both patients and medical team for real‐time data sharing, smart analysis and remote monitoring which significantly improve management efficiency and release medical resources for more patients. The Shared Care program in our hospital was established since Jan. 2018. Until Jul. 2019, there are totally 1062 patients receiving continuous diabetes care which was provided by a multidisciplinary team. 82.8% patients are followed regularly every three months, the HbA1c achieving rate (<7%) is 69.5% after 1‐year follow‐up. Patient's self‐management behavior improves one year after admission. The study is aim to discover the influencing factors that affect the HbA1c achieving rate and the efficiency and effect of the new model Shared Care.

N2  -  Wearable grip sensing shows potential for hand rehabilitation, but few studies have studied feasibility early after stroke. Here, we studied a wearable grip sensor integrated with a musical computer game (MusicGlove). Among the stroke patients admitted to a hospital without limiting complications, 13% had adequate hand function for system use. Eleven subjects used MusicGlove at home over three weeks with a goal of nine hours of use. On average they achieved 4.1 ± 3.2 (SD) hours of use and completed 8627 ± 7500 grips, an amount comparable to users in the chronic phase of stroke measured in a previous study. The rank‐order usage data were well fit by distributions that arise in machine failure theory. Users operated the game at high success levels, achieving note‐hitting success >75% for 84% of the 1061 songs played. They changed game parameters infrequently (31% of songs), but in a way that logically modulated challenge, consistent with the Challenge Point Hypothesis from motor learning. Thus, a therapy based on wearable grip sensing was feasible for home rehabilitation, but only for a fraction of subacute stroke subjects. Subjects made usage decisions consistent with theoretical models of machine failure and motor learning.

N2  -  One‐third of the UK adult population presents with disordered sleep, and the prevalence further increases with ageing. Disordered sleep has also been identified as a risk factor for dementia, which is alarming given that cases of dementia are predicted to triple across the world by 2050. Our study aims to build on emerging evidence showing relationships between gut health, sleep, and brain functions. To achieve this, our study aims to test the feasibility of using non‐pharmacological interventions: a psychoeducation‐based intervention (enhanced sleep education ‐ ESE) and a dietary supplement (Saffron extract), to improve sleep in older adults with insomnia. The study aims to test the feasibility of using wearable sleep tracking EEG technology (DREEM3 device) to measure sleep quality in the home environment, which could contribute to a reliable but naturalistic and accessible future sleep research. The study is split into 4 phases: Screening phase: Participants will be asked to complete an online screening assessment to check for eligibility. Baseline assessment phase (1 week): Participants will complete in‐person testing in the Sleep and Brain Research Unit (SBRU) located at the University of East Anglia, to assess their cognitive functions, psychological well‐being, and postural control. They will be asked to provide a faecal sample to profile the baseline gut microbiota, a urine sample to gain a baseline measure for testing supplement adherence and wear the DREEM3 headband device and complete a sleep diary to track their sleep quality with a high accuracy in their habitual home environment. Intervention phase (4 weeks): Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups following a factorial design: Group 1: Food supplement & ESE; Group 2: Food supplement & No ESE (control); Group 3: Placebo (control) & ESE, and Group 4: Placebo (control) & No ESE (control). These groups will allow us to test the effectiveness of each non‐pharmacological intervention for feasibility. Follow‐up assessment (1 week ‐ overlap with the last week of intervention): Participants will be asked to measure their sleep at home using the DREEM3 EEG device and complete a sleep diary, and finally will be re‐tested for cognitive performance, psychological wellbeing, and postural control. A follow‐up faecal sample and urine sample will be collected as well. This research predicts that it is feasible for sleep difficulties in older adults to be objectively assessed in the home environment and non‐pharmacologically treated using food supplements and behavioural techniques. It endeavours to provide pilot evidence for the effectiveness of future individualized non‐pharmaceutical sleep treatments in older people at risk of dementia.

N2  -  Background The condition of being overweight is an increasing problem worldwide, becoming an epidemic both in Europe and in the United States. Recent estimates that over 60% of adults are overweight and at the same time obesity affects around 35% of the population. In the US the cost of the health system to cope with obesity and related diseases now exceeds the sum of 100 billion and in Europe costs are currently similar. Health risks related to being overweight include psychological difficulties, depression and stigma, physical problems and heart diseases, cancer and respiratory diseases not to mention musculoskeletal and metabolic problems. Obesity is a chronic health condition, but is also a major risk factor for various diseases both chronic and acute. This problem is currently steadily rising, with prevalence data and epidemiological estimates that should be of great concern. Despite strong biological components and hereditary aspects, obesity is primarily linked to incorrect habits of everyday life, mainly eating habits and physical activity. Numerous studies have documented that regular physical activity and wise choices in food uptake can prevent obesity and related conditions. The main challenge in addressing obesity and associated disorders is represented by developing and making available and sustainable comprehensive programs that include combinations of physical activity, dietary aspects and psychological interventions. Interventions developed in this way, including dietary education protocols, physical rehabilitation and exercises programs, nutritional, endocrinological, psychological, surgical and pharmacological treatments are mainly effective in the short term, despite many of which are characterized by high costs and several periods of hospitalization. The analysis of the literature suggests the superiority of intensive multidisciplinary interventions: health protocols, dietary programs, psychological and physical rehabilitation. One of the problems of such interventions is that they are often only possible during an hospitalization period, with high costs associated. However, despite good evidence of effectiveness, the long‐term results are generally limited. In general, availability, costs, compliance and long‐term efficacy are important limitations to this variety of approaches. Frequently obese individuals regain about 30% of the weight they lost within the first year. After only 3 years they are returning to pre‐treatment weight. Psychological intervention are generally assumed to be one of the core parts in the treatment aimed to obesity. In particular, Cognitive‐Behavioral interventions, usually within multidisciplinary paths and rarely implemented individually, are generally considered the gold‐standard for addressing the epidemic of obesity, or "globesity". By modifying deeply rooted and long‐term acquired habits, the person with obesity can obtain more psychological and physical health, reduce risk factors and improve his overall health, wellness and quality of life with benefits not only for the individual but also for his social environment. Although the existing programs already provide protocol phases to be implemented once they are home, often the patients fail to adhere to nutrition programs and planned activities. On the contrary they return frequently to previous habits, and show a high drop‐out rate at follow‐ups. Rationale Reasons for the long‐term failure of interventions for obesity can be found in the lack of long‐term sources of reinforcement for healthy habits acquired during the intensive treatment period. The tradition of behavioral sciences has developed models of interpretation, explanation and pragmatic operation supported by evidence of effectiveness and efficiency in the promotion of desired behaviors in various contexts and with a longer time effect. These span from the cessation of smoking, passing trough the ability to adapt and live with chronic diseases, ending with the promotion of safety behaviors in working environments. For this reason behavior analysis in general, and in particular the Contextual Behavioral Science, can play a decisive role in the prevention of obesity and keeping the results achieved within short intensive protocols, usually held in hospitals. During the rehabilitation periods patients affected by obesity are frequently in contact with contingencies that are very different from those of their daily lives. In the rehabilitation facility or during the hospitalization, contingencies are efficiently shaped to promote desired behaviors and decrease actions that are identified as dysfunctional, with both aversive and reinforcing contingencies. Later on, after the treatment, in his natural environment initially behaviors are maintained, but having been promoted in a environment that provide contingencies supporting healthy behaviors, they often undergo a processes of extinction consequently with cessation of reinforce. At the same time, outside the hospital, dysfunctional behaviors such as avoiding physical activity and eating tasty food, are reinforced in a systematic and contingent way. This tendency to extinction of functional and healthy habits and reinforcement of dysfunctional habits leads, in the long term to gain the weight lost laboriously and this also leads to lower levels of well‐being. To overcome the limited long‐term adherence after the hospitalization period, it is necessary to find a way to give significant, contingent and informative feedback also after the rehabilitation phase. In this regard the use of activity trackers represents a clear, valid and "smart" use of new technologies, linked to well established behavioral science. Hypothesis, goals and expected results The project aims to promote a long‐term change in lifestyle of as part of a multidisciplinary intervention, in close collaboration with physicians, the service of Clinical Nutrition and the osteo‐articular rehabilitation. The main goal of this study is test the efficacy of combining behavioral change technologies through contingent and meaningful feedbacks provided by wearable devices with ACT‐based intervention, a well‐studied psychological treatment developed in a contextual behavioral framework. The combination of thisapproach should be feasible and efficient, compared with gold standard treatment with inferior costs. Four experimental condition are provided: 1) usual care during hospitalization with programmed follow‐up checks, 2) contingent feedback on daily life activities through activity trackers or wearable device stand‐alone, 3) ACT based intervention stand‐alone, 4). combination of the previous two, ACT‐Based Intervention and Activity Tracker with Feedback. Primary outcome, or dependent variable, of the study is physical activity as collected by wearable electronic devices. Other outcomes, as for example time of sleep, are collected by wearables, and other provided by self report through web platform. The independent variable of the study is the type of treatment (ACT intervention and feedbacks provided by activity trackers). For the purpose of the study we collect data about daily steps and workout log for each participants. The intervention aims to help people in their everyday environment to remain more consistent with the choices made, and follow appropriate diets and physical activity. The project is directed to participants in the multidisciplinary rehabilitation program at St. Joseph Hospital ‐ Verbania, Italian Auxological Institute, a private research institute that works also for the Italian national health system. The recruitment will take place progressively and subjects will be randomized to the four experimental conditions expected by the protocol. Data will be analyzed in different experimental single‐subjects over multiple baselines designs. The subjects are also grouped according to the experimental condition to allow statistical analysis of experimental designs intergroup, consistent with the approach of a controlled and randomized trial. Due to the novelty of using a combination of behavioral change strategies with Acceptance and Mindfulness ‐ based therapy with wearable device to promote healthy life‐style in the post‐rehabilitation period, no well defined hypothesis have been established about the possible contribution of this kind of intervention in comparison with usual care, the "gold standard" multi‐disciplinary treatment chronic conditions linked to obesity. With the development of mobile technology and brief clinical protocols, new interventions in the field of obesity and connected chronic pathologies have to be evaluated. Anyway, the mACTonHEALTH study is quite innovative for different reasons. First, combination of single case designs with RCT is uncommon, particularly with medium‐scale studies like this. Second, using wearable device activity trackers both as device for data collection measuring the primary outcomes and as device to provide contingent feedbacks, assumed to as one the two independent variable. Third, combining directly brief ACT intervention and behavior modification strategies with mobile‐tech implementation is another element of innovation. Furthermore, although ACT is becoming well‐studied in the traditional clinical context, large‐scale application to both medical and natural settings has not largely occurred. Including in assessment procedure direct collectable data, indicators of both physical and psychosocial health. Also, the inclusion of objective physiological outcome measures constitutes an aspect of innovation in ACT research. Last, the study will focus on mediation mechanisms underlying treatment success and presents possible links to systematic models on psychological flexibility, a core process assessed in ACT researches. Hypothesis To the best of the researcher's knowledge, this study will be the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a combination of contingent feedbacks provided with wearable devices with ACT‐based interventions to improve healthy life style according to medical and behavioral prescription among obese patients. It is also one of the first example of a large implementation of multiple single case designs with a continuous data collection, made possible due the implementation of wearable‐technology. Conducted in the context of clinical practice, this trial will potentially offer empirical support to alternative interventions to improve radical long‐time change in life habits and consequently promote quality of life reducing mortality and morbidity rates among obese population. Furthermore, by virtue of its short duration, the program could potentially be utilized for health promotion also in non‐hospitalization context and primary or secondary prevention of obesity and linked conditions.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Cancer patients with chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) have deficits in sensory and motor skills leading to inappropriate proprioceptive feedback, impaired postural control, and fall risk. Balance training programs specifically developed for CIPN patients are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This pilot study investigated the effect of an interactive motor adaptation balance training program based on wearable sensors for improving balance in older cancer patients with CIPN. METHODS: Twenty‐two patients (age: 70.3 ± 8.7 years) with objectively confirmed CIPN [vibration perception threshold (VPT) >25 V] were randomized to either an intervention (IG) or a control (CG) group. The IG received interactive game‐based balance training including repetitive weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing tasks. Wearable sensors provided real‐time visual/auditory feedback from the lower limb trajectory and allowed the perception of motor errors during each motor action. The CG received no exercise intervention and continued their normal activity. Outcome measures were changes in sway of ankle, hip, and center of mass (CoM) in both mediolateral and anteroposterior (AP) directions during 30‐second balance tests with increasing task difficulty [i.e. standing in feet‐closed position with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), and in semi‐tandem position with EO] at baseline and after the intervention. Additionally, gait performance (speed, variability) and fear of falling [Falls Efficacy Scale‐International (FES‐I)] were measured. RESULTS: Training was safe despite the participants' impaired health status, great severity of CIPN (VPT 49.6 ± 26.7 V), and great fear of falling (FES‐I score 31.37 ± 11.20). After the intervention, sway of hip, ankle, and CoM was significantly reduced in the IG compared to the CG while standing in feet‐closed position with EO (p = 0.010‐0.022, except AP CoM sway) and in semi‐tandem position (p = 0.008‐0.035, except ankle sway). No significant effects were found for balance with EC, gait speed, and FES‐I score (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This proof‐of‐concept study demonstrates that older cancer patients with CIPN can significantly improve their postural balance with specifically tailored, sensor‐based exercise training. The training approach has potential as a therapy for improving CIPN‐related postural control deficits. However, future studies comparing the proposed technology‐based training with traditional balance training are required to evaluate the benefit of the interactive joint movement feedback.

N2  -  Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) SARS‐Cov‐2 disease (COVID‐19) is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus. The pandemic first described in Wuhan, China, has since spread across the whole world and caused dramatic strain on health care in many countries. The virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.1 Patients infected with the virus mostly report mild to moderate respiratory symptoms like shortness of breath and coughing, and febrile symptoms. Most recover without requiring special treatment. However, older people, and those with underlying medical problems (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer) are more likely to develop serious illness.1 Younger patients have been reported with serious illness as well. In the present situation, it is of paramount importance to preserve health service capacity by identifying those with serious illness without transferring all infected patients to emergency rooms or Hospitals. In addition, it is important to identify seriously ill patients early enough and before they reach a point of deterioration where they can be extremely challenging to handle in both prehospital and hospital environment. The number of subjects with positive test of the virus is increasing and so does the number of patients hospitalized.2 In parallel, most patients with positive test result or typical clinical symptoms are at home with information what to do if their clinical symptom status deteriorates.2 The Norwegian Interaction Reform was implemented in 2012.3 Key elements of the reform are guidance of the health care in the future and identify new directions. Prevention and early efforts are important and this will be achieved by creating co‐working arenas for different parts of our health system. More health services must be moved closer to where the inhabitants live and simultaneously strengthening the community health system. New tools for monitoring the well‐being of the patients must be developed in order to act early enough to avoid severe deterioration of health status and avoid new hospitalization. This goal has become even more important during the Covid 19 pandemic because the healthcare system is not prepared or built to take care of all these patients in hospitals. In the local community's wearable and wireless biosensors collecting continuous physiological data (CPD) in real time in order to generate information reflecting the patients' current state is established. This is recognized as welfare technology, and it is a generic term for a heterogeneous group of technologies.4 There are few studies documenting their efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency. One key driver for the development of wearable biosensors is the potential to use CPD to generate real‐time, clinically actionable insights from predictive analytics that include early warnings of clinical deterioration and prompts for behavioral changes. The advent of machine learning methods that can detect subtle patterns from large sets of CPD may make this achievable. Using CPD to guide clinical decisions may be a major advance for patients with chronic diseases and at present time when our health system is put on an extreme stretch. This may drive the evolution from episodic to continuous patient care. The present study is designed to sample biosensor data from patients treated and observed at home due to mild and moderate SARS‐Cov‐2 disease. Such a system would be useful, both for the treatment of individual patients as well as for assessing the efficacy and safety of care given to these patients. Investigators intend to improve quality and safety of home care by continuous monitoring and a set of rules for follow‐up. Investigators hypothesized that patients and local health system may benefit from the feedback of a simple monitoring system, which detects changes in respiration, temperature and circulation variables in combination with the patient's subjective experiences of care. Patients may be referred to hospitalization earlier. In the present study investigators will use live continuous and non‐continuous biosensor data to monitor the development of vital parameters for Covid 19 patients compared with patients who are not monitored electronically (standard of care).

N2  -  Background And Aims: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common treatable risk factor for stroke. However, it is uncertain whether screening for AF in asymptomatic individuals is effective. Methods: This investigator‐initiated randomized trial recruited individuals from primary care practices in Canada and Germany aged ≥75 years with hypertension and no history of AF or anticoagulant use. Eligible participants were assigned a 2‐week wearable ECG (Zio XT patch) at baseline and at 3 months (screening group) or usual care (control group). The primary outcome was AF detected within 6 months by study monitors (≥5 minutes) or clinically. Secondary outcomes included device adherence and anticoagulation at 6 months. Results: From March 2015‐ April 2019, we enrolled 856 participants from 48 practices: age 80.0±4.0 years; 56.9% female; median CHA2DS2‐VASc score 4 points (IQR 4‐5). Median ECG wear time was 27.4 days (IQR 18.4‐28.0). AF was detected in 23/434 participants (5.3%) in the screening group vs. 2/ 422 (0.5%) in the control group; p<0.0001. Median duration of the longest device‐detected AF episode per patient was 5.0 hours (IQR 2.8‐9.9 hours; range 5 min.‐13.9 days); median number of AF episodes per patient was 2 (IQR 1‐3; range 1‐76). Anticoagulation was initiated in 80% of patients with screendetected AF. At 6 months, anticoagulant use was greater in the screening group (4.1% vs. 0.9%; p=0.003). No patient had a major bleed. Conclusions: Among older community‐dwelling individuals, AF screening with wearable ECGs was feasible, superior to standard care for detecting actionable AF (number needed to screen=21), and prompted anticoagulation with the potential to avert future strokes.

N2  -  Following the completion of centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CR), lifetime adoption of physical activity (PA) and adherence to exercise is often poor. Wearable activity monitors may be a tool to remotely prescribe and monitor PA and exercise to promote long term behaviour change. This research aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) testing a remotely prescribed and monitored long‐term maintenance exercise programme in cardiac rehabilitation graduates with coronary heart disease (CHD). 30 participants with CHD will be recruited to a 12‐month feasibility RCT and randomised into 2 arms: 1) a home‐based watch intervention group and 2) a best practice usual care control group. The intervention group will receive an initial exercise consultation, personalised exercise prescription delivered via a Polar Ignite watch, and monitoring via check‐ins and feedback text‐message support with a clinical exercise physiologist. The control group will receive no intervention. All participants will undergo assessment at baseline (following the completion of CR) and at 3 follow up time points including 3‐, 6‐ and 12‐months. The primary outcome will be to assess feasibility and other process‐related outcomes. The secondary outcomes will include exercise capacity, physical activity and sedentary behaviour, exercise time, cardiovascular disease risk, quality of life, depression, anxiety, self‐efficacy, patient activation, health utility, health and social care resource use, cost, and adverse and serious adverse events. Semi‐structured interviews will be conducted at 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐months post‐randomisation to explore the views, perceptions, acceptability, and experiences of the remotely prescribed and monitored exercise intervention and trial procedures. Participants who drop out or choose not to participate will be offered a semi‐structured interview or a questionnaire, respectively, to understand feasibility. Overall, there is a need to support people post‐CR to remotely maintain PA and exercise behaviour for secondary prevention of CHD particularly during the era of government‐enforced restrictions or lockdowns due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The MAINTAIN study will assess the feasibility of longer‐term remote prescription and monitoring of maintenance exercise following CR using a wearable activity monitor and text message support compared to best practice usual care for people diagnosed with CHD.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Long‐term adherence to exercise is often poor for people with coronary heart disease (CHD) who have completed supervised, centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a remotely prescribed, delivered and monitored cardiac rehabilitation intervention using a wearable device to support long‐term adherence to exercise and physical activity during maintenance of cardiac rehabilitation. METHODS: After completing cardiac rehabilitation, 30 participants with CHD, will be randomised (1:1) to an intervention (n?=?15) or a usual care group (n?=?15) in a 12‐month feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT). The intervention will comprise of an exercise consultation, personalised exercise prescription delivered via a wearable activity monitor using biometric feedback, regular monitoring via check‐ins, and feedback text‐messages for 6‐months. Participants will be assessed at baseline (following completion of cardiac rehabilitation) and at three‐, six‐, and 12‐months post‐randomisation. The primary outcome will be feasibility, including assessment of eligibility, recruitment, adherence, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes will include exercise capacity, physical activity behaviours, cardiovascular disease risk and quality of life. Semi‐structured interviews will be conducted at three‐, six‐, and 12‐months post‐randomisation (and with those who drop‐out) to explore the acceptability of the study intervention and procedures. A questionnaire will be offered to those who decline participation. DISCUSSION: The MAINTAIN study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a future definitive multi‐centre RCT testing a remotely prescribed and monitored long‐term mHealth maintenance exercise programme, versus usual care, for people with CHD who have completed cardiac rehabilitation.

N2  -  Importance: Increasingly, individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) use wearable devices (hereafter wearables) that measure pulse rate and detect arrhythmia. The associations of wearables with health outcomes and health care use are unknown. Objective: To characterize patients with AF who use wearables and compare pulse rate and health care use between individuals who use wearables and those who do not. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, propensity‐matched cohort study included 90 days of follow‐up of patients in a tertiary care, academic health system. Included patients were adults with at least 1 AF‐specific International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10) code from 2017 through 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed to identify 125 individuals who used wearables and had adequate pulse‐rate follow‐up who were then matched using propensity scores 4 to 1 with 500 individuals who did not use wearables. Data were analyzed from June 2020 through February 2021. Exposure: Using commercially available wearables with pulse rate or rhythm evaluation capabilities. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean pulse rates from measures taken in the clinic or hospital and a composite health care use score were recorded. The composite outcome included evaluation and management, ablation, cardioversion, telephone encounters, and number of rate or rhythm control medication orders. Results: Among 16320 patients with AF included in the analysis, 348 patients used wearables and 15972 individuals did not use wearables. Prior to matching, patients using wearables were younger (mean [SD] age, 64.0 [13.0] years vs 70.0 [13.8] years; P <.001) and healthier (mean [SD] CHA2DS2‐VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 65 years or 65‐74 years, diabetes, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, sex] score, 3.6 [2.0] vs 4.4 [2.0]; P <.001) compared with individuals not using wearables, with similar gender distribution (148 [42.5%] women vs 6722 women [42.1%]; P =.91). After matching, mean pulse rate was similar between 125 patients using wearables and 500 patients not using wearables (75.01 [95% CI, 72.74‐77.27] vs 75.79 [95% CI, 74.68‐76.90] beats per minute [bpm]; P =.54), whereas mean composite use score was higher among individuals using wearables (3.55 [95% CI, 3.31‐3.80] vs 3.27 [95% CI, 3.14‐3.40]; P =.04). Among measures in the composite outcome, there was a significant difference in use of ablation, occurring in 22 individuals who used wearables (17.6%) vs 37 individuals who did not use wearables (7.4%) (P =.001). In the regression analyses, mean composite use score was 0.28 points (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.56 points) higher among individuals using wearables compared with those not using wearables and mean pulse was similar, with a ‐0.79 bpm (95% CI ‐3.28 to 1.71 bpm) difference between the groups. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that follow‐up health care use among individuals with AF was increased among those who used wearables compared with those with similar pulse rates who did not use wearables. Given the increasing use of wearables by patients with AF, prospective, randomized, long‐term evaluation of the associations of wearable technology with health outcomes and health care use is needed..

N2  -  OBJECTIVE: Automated insulin delivery is the new standard for type 1 diabetes, but exercise‐related hypoglycemia remains a challenge. Our aim was to determine whether a dual‐hormone closed‐loop system using wearable sensors to detect exercise and adjust dosing to reduce exercise‐related hypoglycemia would outperform other forms of closed‐loop and open‐loop therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants underwent four arms in randomized order: dual‐hormone, single‐hormone, predictive low glucose suspend, and continuation of current care over 4 outpatient days. Each arm included three moderate‐intensity aerobic exercise sessions. The two primary outcomes were percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and in a target range (70‐180 mg/dL) assessed across the entire study and from the start of the in‐clinic exercise until the next meal. RESULTS: The analysis included 20 adults with type 1 diabetes who completed all arms. The mean time (SD) in hypoglycemia was the lowest with dual‐hormone during the exercise period: 3.4% (4.5) vs. 8.3% (12.6) single‐hormone (P = 0.009) vs. 7.6% (8.0) predictive low glucose suspend (P < 0.001) vs. 4.3% (6.8) current care where pre‐exercise insulin adjustments were allowed (P = 0.49). Time in hypoglycemia was also the lowest with dual‐hormone during the entire 4‐day study: 1.3% (1.0) vs. 2.8% (1.7) single‐hormone (P < 0.001) vs. 2.0% (1.5) predictive low glucose suspend (P = 0.04) vs. 3.1% (3.2) current care (P = 0.007). Time in range during the entire study was the highest with single‐hormone: 74.3% (8.0) vs. 72.0% (10.8) dual‐hormone (P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of glucagon delivery to a closed‐loop system with automated exercise detection reduces hypoglycemia in physically active adults with type 1 diabetes.

N2  -  Specific Aims: This application proposes to randomize community‐dwelling, older adults to one of two, 12‐week activity interventions that target either increased moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA) or decreased sedentary behavior (SED). The primary aim of this research is to evaluate the effect of a behavioral intervention targeting decreased SED vs. increased MVPA on objectively monitored activity (minutes of SED and MVPA). The secondary aim is to evaluate the effect of the SED intervention vs. the MVPA intervention on functional and psychosocial outcomes. To the investigators knowledge, this research will provide unique experimental evidence that SED can be altered in an older adult population and will yield key pilot data on the expected effect size for an intervention targeting SED vs. MVPA. Background: The older adult population is the least active age group in the U.S. by two distinct metrics: a lack of MVPA and a high rate of SED (sitting without any significant exertion). This represents a public health opportunity because engaging in 150 minutes of MVPA is known to improve the risk of morbidity, mortality, and physical function. SED has emerged as a risk factor for adverse outcomes, independent of MVPA, and observational studies indicate that more SED is linked to an increased risk of clinical outcomes (mortality, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) and worse aging outcomes, e.g. physical function. However, there exists no experimental data comparing interventions to reduce SED vs. increase MVPA in older adults. Summary of Methods: The investigators propose a 2‐arm randomized trial that will target increasing MVPA (Get Active) vs. decreasing SED (Sit Less) among community‐dwelling, older adults from the Pepper Center Mobility Registry. The intervention will consist of a combination of in‐person (Weeks 1‐4, 6, 8, 10) and phone‐based (Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11) individual counseling and will utilize the BodyMedia® Fit System (wearable armband with technology interface) to provide real‐time feedback on daily MVPA or SED, which can be used by the subjects to self‐monitor and by the interventionist to improve adherence. Assessments at baseline and 12 weeks will include objectively monitored minutes of MVPA and SED by a blinded armband, physical function (short physical performance battery, 400 meter walk, grip strength, gait speed), and assessment of subjective MVPA, SED, physical function, and psychosocial outcomes by questionnaires.

N2  -  Cancer survivors are at an increased risk of bone loss due to previous cancer treatments and are at increased risk of obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases. Therefore it is important for cancer survivors to adhere to an active lifestyle and good nutrition. The study proposes a single site, pilot, randomized clinical trial to examine the efficacy of a lifestyle program that includes recreational soccer (RS) and nutrition education compared to mobile health lifestyle program to improve bone density and bone turnover. It proposes that leveraging the growing enthusiasm around soccer in Atlanta and the U.S. may lead to increased interest, participation, retention and engagement in lifestyle change programming among prostate cancer (PCa) survivors. Therefore, this study seeks to directly test the implementation feasibility of a lifestyle change intervention in combination with RS and determine its effects in bone health, body composition, mental health, functional and cardiometabolic status among PCa survivors. A comparison group will receive usual care plus a low cost, mobile‐health (mHealth) enabled lifestyle intervention, without supervised physical activity (PA) programming. The aim is to recruit 40 men (50% African American or Latino) that have been in survivor status for at least 6 months from several Winship Cancer Institute clinical sites. The trial will exclude those with metastatic disease, already too active, and with any contraindications to exercise. The participants will be randomized after eligibility screening and will be scheduled for baseline assessments. The intervention group will be offered twice/week 60‐minute soccer conditioning sessions using an evidence‐based Football Fitness curriculum, delivered by trained soccer coaches. They will also receive lifestyle education including nutrition and other American Heart Association (AHA) Life's Simple 7 core messages after soccer sessions for 15 minutes. The comparison group will receive weekly educational and motivational text messages, aimed at improving physical activity (PA) and lifestyles. Both intervention and comparison groups will receive a wearable Garmin device to objectively monitor PA volume (steps) and intensity (minutes of moderate and vigorous) PA, as well as sedentary and sleep time. The study will assess pre and post differences in bone mineral density (primary outcome), body composition (DXA), bone turnover biomarkers, anthropometrics, diet, physical fitness, blood pressure and patient‐reported outcomes including PA and diet self‐efficacy, quality of life and depression. The trial will also compare the compliance with the federal recommendations of 150 weekly minutes of moderate‐to‐vigorous PA between the recreational soccer‐based intervention and the comparison group, as a marker of program adherence. All study assessments will be conducted at the Emory Clinical Research Center on the Clifton Campus and the intervention group will have their soccer sessions on a soccer field in the Atlanta area that is convenient for the participants. All participants will be given gift cards for each assessment visit. The investigators anticipate the RS program will be more efficacious in preventing bone loss and increasing weight loss in PCa survivors. This study will engage men in a lifestyle program that has the potential to sustain healthy behaviors beyond the term of the study.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Early detection of preclinical symptoms and prediction of potential development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) could improve non‐pharmacologic, life‐style and exercise related preventative interventions' efficacy and slow‐down disease progression. To achieve this goal, discriminating the earliest preclinical stage of MCI/AD from healthy state would be necessary. However, this is still challenging and current clinical methods are not feasible for preventative screening in larger populations of older adults, as they involve invasive sampling of molecular blood or cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, as well as expensive brain imaging and extensive neuropsychological testing. Recently, several non‐invasive alternative measures, including electroencephalography (EEG), gait analysis, heart rate variability (HRV), and core body temperature (Tc), were shown to be associated with preclinical symptoms of MCI/AD and to predict disease progression. AIM: The investigators aim to combine these measures in a novel non‐invasive multi‐parameter prediction model, which better reflects multimodal symptomatology compared to currently used methods and, therefore, allows discriminating healthy persons from MCI state with adequate sensitivity (i.e. >80%). METHODS: A cohort of 85 older adults, ≥65 years of age, including healthy persons and patients with MCI, will be recruited. Assessments will be performed at baseline, after 2 months (within these two 2 months one group will follow a cognitive‐motor training intervention, while the other serves as passive control), and at 12‐month follow‐up. Assessments include EEG, gait analysis, HRV, and Tc at rest and during walking, and will be compared to reference measures of MCI status, including neuropsychological tests, to develop the prediction model and evaluate its sensitivity.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs) identify cardiovascular disease risk, but few effective interventions are available. High sedentary behavior (SED) has recently been associated with APOs, but very few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have tested SED reduction in pregnancy. OBJECTIVE: The Sedentary Behavior Reduction in Pregnancy Intervention (SPRING) pilot and feasibility RCT addresses this gap by testing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary pregnancy health effects of an intervention to reduce SED in pregnant women. The objective of this manuscript is to describe the rationale and design of SPRING. METHODS: Pregnant participants (n=53) in their first trimester, who are at risk for high SED and APO and without contraindications, are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to an intervention or control group. SED (primary outcome) and standing durations, and steps per day, are measured objectively in each trimester for 1 week with a thigh‐mounted activPAL3 accelerometer. SPRING also seeks to demonstrate feasibility and acceptability while estimating preliminary effects on maternal‐fetal health outcomes assessed during study visits and abstracted from medical records. The pregnancy‐customized intervention promotes daily behavioral targets of less than 9 hours of SED and at least 7500 steps, achieved via increased standing and incorporating light‐intensity movement breaks each hour. The multicomponent intervention provides a height‐adjustable workstation, a wearable activity monitor, behavioral counseling every 2 weeks (through videoconference), and membership in a private social media group. Herein, we review the rationale, describe recruitment and screening processes, and detail the intervention, assessment protocols, and planned statistical analyses. RESULTS: This study was funded by the American Heart Association (20TPA3549099), with a funding period of January 1, 2021, and until December 31, 2023. Institutional review board approval was obtained on February 24, 2021. Participants were randomized between October 2021 and September 2022, with final data collection planned for May 2023. Analyses and submission of results are expected for winter of 2023. CONCLUSIONS: The SPRING RCT will provide initial evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of an SED‐reduction intervention to decrease SED in pregnant women. These data will inform the design of a large clinical trial testing SED reduction as a strategy to reduce APO risk.

N2  -  Background and Aims: Although recent advances have provided effective treatments for ischemic stroke, a majority of patients are not treated because of arrival beyond the time window for reperfusion treatment. Based on a health‐economic model, we estimated the potential outcome and costs by shortening time to thrombectomy for Large Vessel Occlusions (LVO) using bilateral bracelet accelerometers that can detect stroke within 30 minutes of onset. Method(s): Outcome‐data for thrombectomy of anterior circulation LVO were obtained from meta‐analysis of recent randomized trials (HERMEScollaboration). Outcome‐data for untreated LVO patients were obtained from the DEFUSE3 trial. Health economic effects were based on cost estimation (including QALY) for each level on the MRS‐scale by Mangla et al 2016. Result(s): The average direct and indirect costs/patients was 253.307 USD for thrombectomy within 3h, 734.778 USD for thrombectomy within 8h and 1.416.581 USD for LVO patients that was not treated with thrombectomy. The potential treatment outcome benefit is substantial with treatment within 3h of onset instead of 8h (Figure), which may be possible by detection within 30‐60 minutes of onset. The average cost reduction by early treatment would be 481 470 USD/patient for the populations within the HERMES collaboration. However, the greatest effect would come from allowing patients not treated due to late arrival to hospital to be treated within 3h of onset (Figure). The average cost reduction in this group would be 1.162.000 USD/patient. Conclusion(s): Early detection of major stroke within 30 minutes by using a wearable stroke alarm would potentially augment LVO thrombectomy outcome profoundly, with substantial health economic savings.

N2  -  The ExoNET, a passive robotic solution that provides a soft, biomimetic, and elastic alternative to robotics that embodies intelligence within the mechanical design. Several groups have been exploring performance enhancement using springs with custom‐tuned parameters via optimization. Here, it is possible to have a simple reconfigurable system that can not only assist performance, but can also make training easier, faster, and more complete. This contribution has the potential to be clinically significant for rehabilitating neurologically impaired individuals because this proposal will investigate how motor learning can be facilitated through novel assistive technology. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy using the ExoNET. Specifically, investigators want to see if the ExoNET tuned to gravity support will lead to a reduction in bicep muscle activity and an increase in range of motion. To accomplish this aim, we plan to have participants perform reaching, arm elevation and flexion task exercises wearing the ExoNET. To achieve these goals, we will use a wearable activity tracker (MiGo), to detect the number of activities performed, a wearable surface EMG system (Delsys) on the bicep muscles and a markerless system called the Kinect (version 2) to collect distribution of motion. Investigators hypothesize that individuals with post‐stroke arm movement deficits treated with ExoNET gravity compensation will improve their ARAT measures more than controls receiving a sham treatment. Secondarily, treated subjects will improve in other clinical metrics and will make more movements than controls.

N2  -  The purpose of this study is to learn more about the ways in which mobile technology can be integrated into inpatient care to help better track pain levels using mobile technology of patients with sickle cell disease, oncology patients, and bone marrow transplant patients. The study will assess whether or not daily mobile monitoring with wearable accelerometers (devices that detect movement as well as heart‐rate) to monitor and manage medical treatments can have a lasting positive impact on outcomes in patients with chronic diseases. The investigator hopes to learn more about the ways in which mobile technology can be integrated into inpatient care. Specifically, the investigator is looking to help patients better track their pain, use wearable technology to track physiological measures (for example, heart rate, sleep quantity and quality), and integrate these data points into the medical care of patients by providing the information to providers. This study will first gather information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the use of technology on the inpatient unit. This will help the study team to refine the technology of the mobile app and logistics of integration. Following this, the investigator will complete a second phase of the study, during which select patients will pilot the intervention. This will be followed by the third and final phase, during which patients will be randomly assigned to the active intervention or standard of care. This phase approach will enable the study team to refine the intervention, relying on the feedback from patients and providers, and subsequently test its utility compared to standard of care through random assignment.

N2  -  Specific Aims The primary aims of this study are: 1. Develop and the field test the I‐CREST system; 2. Evaluate the effectiveness of I‐CREST intervention on cardiac rehabilitation (CR) utilization, cardiac self‐efficacy, functional capacity, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, depression, medication adherence, cardiac risk factor control; 3. Evaluate the cost‐effectiveness of I‐CREST intervention compared with a traditional CBCR programme; and 4. Explore participants' perceptions with regards to the usability, utility, acceptability, strengths, and weaknesses of the I‐CREST intervention. Study Hypotheses Study participants will be randomised into either the experimental group (receive the I‐CREST intervention) or to the control group (receive the traditional CBCR provided by the hospital). Compared to the control group, it is hypothesized that the experimental group will have: 1. Have significantly higher CR utilization and cardiac self‐efficacy 2. Demonstrate equivalent HRQoL, medication adherence, social support, self‐regulatory behaviour, functional capacity, anxiety and depression symptoms and cardiac risk factor control 3. Have significantly lower cost to patients and hospitals I‐CREST Development Team A team of researchers, software engineers and cardiac rehabilitation healthcare professionals \ were involved in the development of the I‐CREST system. The development of the I‐CREST system was an interactive and iterative process. Expertise from the various teams were harnessed through discussions and feedback at regular online meetings. Accordingly, decisions on appropriate programme adaptations were made to best suit the objectives of the I‐CREST system. Structure of the I‐CREST System I‐CREST is designed as a 6‐week home‐based cardiac telerehabilitation programme. The I‐CREST system consists of a Garmin activity tracking wearable device, the I‐CREST smartphone application, and the I‐CREST administrative web‐portal. The I‐CREST system will serve as a virtual collaborative platform to connect the multi‐disciplinary CR team (i.e., cardiac RN, cardiologist, cardiac APN, and physiotherapist) to the participant at home and in the community. Participants can access the I‐CREST application system using their own smartphone and will be given a Garmin wearable device. Wireless sensor technology will be employed to record participants' captured health activity and I‐CREST application usage. Data captured on these devices will be synchronized to the web‐portal on a secured cloud server to facilitate the CR multidisciplinary team in providing remote supervision, monitoring, feedback, and counselling. The I‐CREST system is illustrated in Appendix 3. I‐CREST Smartphone Application The I‐CREST smartphone application features are structured based on guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA) to cover all the components of a comprehensive CR program. ‐ Weekly Education Sessions: Education covering different themes related to CHD self‐management will be released weekly. All 6 weeks will include education on progressing their recovery exercise programmes. Education videos on relaxation techniques, stress management, diet, and exercise are also provided. The aim is to improve cardiac self‐efficacy and emotional management trough delivering CHD‐specific factual content and increase goal congruence by tackling confusing myths and contradicting demands on self‐management. ‐ Physical Exercise Monitoring: Weekly exercise goals, in terms of frequency, time and type, will be set by the multidisciplinary CR team and released to participants on the I‐CREST application. Participants will be instructed to exercise within their individualized Target Heart Rate (THR) ‐ set by the physiotherapist ‐ to achieve moderate intensity exercise. Objective physical activity will be captured by the wearable device and synced to the I‐CREST smartphone app and web‐portal. The wearable device will assist participants' self‐regulatory behaviour by automatically alerting participants when monitored heart rate exceeds THR, so participants can regulate their intensity accordingly. After an exercise session, the I‐CREST app will prompt participants to self‐evaluate their exercise session. Graphic feedback generated on the I‐CREST smartphone application will allow for participants' self‐monitoring of their progress and goals achieved. ‐ Vitals Monitoring: Participants will be able to manually log their blood pressure, blood glucose, and weight. Data entered can be graphically visualized to aid in self‐monitoring, trending, and evaluating health progress. ‐ Dietary Logs: Participants can log diet information with photos of their diet as a form of self‐monitoring; entries viewed on the web‐portal will be monitored by the multidisciplinary CR team and discussed during weekly teleconsults with the participant. ‐ Medication Bank: A stored list of cardiac drug information, its indications and side effects, can be viewed by participants to aid in informational support. ‐ Automatically Individualized Reminder: Scheduled medication reminders and targeted motivational fun facts, can be pre‐set by the patient and the CR team respectively, and repeated for certain times/days of the week to enhance medication adherence behaviour and serve as a form of social support and instrumental influence in keeping with the behaviour changes in CR. ‐ Chat Messaging: The CR team will be able to send/receive text/voice messages to/from a participant as a form of social facilitation via informational support. ‐ Weekly Teleconsults: Weekly scheduled calls with the cardiac RN (10‐15 minutes each) will be carried out with participants over the 6 weeks to discuss progress, offer positive reinforcement and motivational support. Prior to weekly consultation calls, participants' weekly updated data will be reviewed by the RN and the CR team. I‐CREST Web‐portal The web portal will be developed using a responsive design, allowing remote access by the CR team and researchers. o Dashboard: The CR team will be able to view all current and active participants undergoing their 6‐week rehabilitation on the Dashboard, as well as get a quick weekly summary of participants' individual exercise duration, average and maximum heart rate achieved, and self‐evaluation feedback. ‐ Health and Usage Reports: In‐depth data on participants' exercise with visual charts of their daily exercise, vital parameters and self‐evaluation will assist the CR team in trending progress and planning for the following week's rehabilitation goals. Individualised rehabilitation goals for the following week entered on the I‐CREST web‐portal will be reflected on participants' I‐CREST smartphone application. Information on participants' I‐CREST smartphone application usage reports (e.g., active users, daily component usages and activities, recent vitals measurements, education completion rate etc.) will be reflected for the CR team to track progress. ‐ Reminders: The web portal will allow administrators to schedule individualized and/or general reminders for each participant related to physical exercises, medications, medical appointments, etc. Administrators may choose to send the reminder on a certain day or to be repeated at certain time/days each week. ‐ Chat Messaging: The CR team will be able to send/receive text/voice messages to/from a participant. The delivery and reading status of messages will be reported. The web portal will provide a way for searching and filtering messages by day and by patient. As the chat messaging platform is an additional reference for participants, it will only be operated during working hours. Participants will be reminded that the I‐CREST platform does not replace emergency services. ‐ Health Alerts: The web portal will alert the CR team in real‐time if captured data reflects adverse events or non‐ adherence. Automated reminders can be programmed to be sent to the participant. ‐ User Management: The CR team will be able to view and manage (e.g., list, create, edit, and delete) existing and previous participants reflected on the I‐CREST web‐portal using search and filtering functionalities to narrow down the participants on the portal by enrolment ID or year. Field‐testing of the I‐CREST System After the development of the I‐CREST system was completed, a field‐testing of the I‐CREST system was undertaken before starting Phase 2 trial implementation. The objective of the field‐testing was to verify the performance, stability, and functionality of the I‐CREST system, as well as validate the content provided on the I‐ CREST smartphone application. A panel of experts (5 participants), including two cardiologists, two physiotherapists and one cardiac advanced practice nurses (APN), were invited to review the entire I‐CREST system (i.e., Garmin wearable device, I‐CREST smartphone application and I‐CREST web‐portal) and validate the contents and features in the I‐CREST smartphone application and web‐portal accuracy and operability respectively. At this stage of the field testing, potential technical issues such as system crashes or bugs, software compatibility, etc. were identified and resolved. Thereafter, 5 post‐CHD patients were invited to review the Garmin wearable device and I‐CREST smartphone application. Face‐to‐face demonstration and education on how to use the various functions in the I‐CREST system were provided to the 5 experts and 5 patients by the research assistant/nurse. The 5 experts and 5 patients were required to complete a validation form to obtain their overall evaluation and feedback of the I‐ CREST system. Questions in the validation form were based on the constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model, and focused on perceived usefulness (i.e., utility) and perceived ease of use (i.e., usability) of the I‐CREST system. While no clinical or demographic data will be collected from these 10 participants (5 experts and 5 post‐CHD patients), informed consent was still obtained for participation in the field‐testing. The feedback collected from the field‐testing is currently being evaluated to guide further system improvements and programme fine tuning. Face‐to‐Face Coaching Session: A one hour of face‐to‐face coaching session will be offered to participants in the I‐CREST group after they have been discharged from the hospital, and have been assessed by the cardiologist or the cardiac APN to be eligible for this study. The research nurse (RN) will conduct the coaching session in a comfortable room setting in a cardiac ward. The patients' family members, their spouses/caregivers whenever possible, will also be invited to attend the training session. The session will take about one hour: 25 minutes for installing and demonstrating the utilisation of the App and wearable heart rate monitor, and 20 minutes to introduce the key topics and functions covered in the App. The last 15 minutes will be used to discuss and set goals with the participants to achieve during this CR programme. In addition, technical phone support is available during the trial as required. Traditional Centre‐based Cardiac Rehabilitation (CBCR) Programme: CBCR offered by the study hospital comprises 12 group‐based outpatient sessions spanning over four weeks. It consists of group exercise sessions supervised by a physiotherapist. Each patient has to undergo an initial and thorough assessment prior to joining the CR programme. The physiotherapist will then counsel the patient after the assessment before the patient joins the group for exercise. The patient will be given a target heart rate to meet during the exercise session, and also given a personal log book to record all exercises done. On top of the group exercise sessions, patients will be given access to online educational resources on adopting healthy heart lifestyle in relations to diet, cardiac risk factors, cardiac disease medication and stress management are also provided for all CBCR participants. Regular feedback will be provided to the participant's physician or specialist. Usual Care Both participants from the i‐CREST group and CBCR group will receive the usual care provided by the hospital. This usual care consists of all existing usual nursing, medical, and follow‐up services as needed. Study Design, Setting and Participants A single‐blinded two‐arm randomised controlled, pretest and repeated posttest design will be used in this project with both quantitative and qualitative measures. Recruitment will be conducted at the cardiac ward of one of the largest acute public hospitals in Singapore. After the baseline measurements, the participants will be randomly assigned to either one of the two groups using block randomization. The two groups are: Control group (receiving the 6‐week traditional centre‐based cardiac rehabilitation (CBCR) programme) and Intervention group (receiving the 6‐week home‐based cardiac telerehabilitation I‐CREST programme) One research nurse (RN) will be trained to conduct the intervention, and another research assistant (RA) will conduct the data collection. The RN will be responsible for remotely monitoring the participants on the I‐CREST system (i.e. intervention), while the RA will be responsible for data collection. The RA will be blinded to participants' group assignment to prevent subjective bias stemming from the knowledge of grouping. Four measurements will be conducted at the baseline prior to the intervention (T0), at 6 weeks from baseline, i.e. immediate after the intervention (T1), at 3 months from the baseline (T2), and at 6 months from the baseline (T3). Outcome measures Outcome measures include: CR utilisation, Cardiac Self‐efficacy Scale (CSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EuroQoL (EQ5D), Myocardial Infarction Dimensional Assessment Scale (MIDAS), Exercise Goal‐Setting Scale (EGS), Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS‐5), Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS‐SSS), Physical Functional Capacity, Cardiac Risk Factors and Clinical Data, and Cost expenditure data Data will be collected at 6 weeks (immediate after the intervention), 3 months and 6 months from baseline. Data analysis TData will be analysed using IBM SPSS version 24. Baseline categorical demographic characteristics between the experimental and control groups will be examined using Chi‐squared or Fisher's Exact test. Independent t‐test will be used for quantitative variables if normality and homogeneity assumptions are satisfied. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be performed to analyse the interaction effect (time x group) between two groups on numerical outcomes over time, setting level of significance at p<0.05 for two‐tailed test. In addition, General Linear Mixed Model (GLM)58 will be used to compare the numerical outcomes between two groups at each time point. To correct for type 1 error on multiple comparisons for each time point, statistical significance will be set at p < 0.01. The Chi‐squared test or Fisher's exact test will be used to test the difference of the CR use including update, adherence and completion between the two groups. For all qualitative data obtained from the process evaluation, all audio taped interviews will be transcribed verbatim. Latent content analysis, which involves an interpretative reading of the symbolism underlying the surface structure in the text, will be used for the qualitative dataset59.

N2  -  Patients with suboptimal glycemic control could be better managed if these higher risk patients could be identified and effective interventions were then targeted towards them. However, most practice settings perform infrequent laboratory testing every 3 to 6 months, if not at longer intervals. Current models to predict change in glycemic control perform poorly and do not take into account the behaviors that occur between these intervals. In this study, we will compare different methods to use data on daily health behaviors collected by wearable devices to enhance risk prediction models. Adults with pre‐diabetes will complete a series of surveys and baseline assessments and then will be randomly assigned to use a waist‐worn or wrist‐worn wearable device for 6 months. Measures of HbA1c and LDL will be obtained at baseline and at 6 months.

N2  -  Objectives: Financial incentive programs are effective in increasing physical activity for overweight, ambulatory adults. We sought to determine the potential effect size and direction of financial incentives on ambulation after radical cystectomy. Materials and Methods: We performed a pilot randomized controlled trial of daily financial incentives to meet postoperative step goals among adults with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤2 who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer at a single center. Step counts were measured over a 3‐ to 14‐day preoperative period and 30‐day postoperative period using a wearable activity monitor. Postoperative daily step goals of 10%, 25%, 40%, and 55% of mean preoperative daily step counts were set for postoperative weeks 1 through 4, respectively. The primary outcome was the number of postoperative days on which the step goals were met. Secondary outcomes included the number of daily postoperative steps taken and the length of stay. Participants randomized to the intervention arm received $1.50 for every day the goal was met with a 20% chance of a $100 reward if the step goal was met on >75% of the first 30 postoperative days. Questionnaires assessing self‐reported physical activity, disability, and social support were administered preoperatively at 30 days postoperatively. Results: Thirty‐three patients were analyzed, 11 in the control and 22 in the intervention arms. There were no statistically significant differences between incentive and control arms for the primary outcome (4.5/30 days vs. 9/30 days, P = 0.53). Results after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics were similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24–4.19, P = 1.00). There were also no differences in average daily postoperative steps (median 979 vs. 1191, 95% CI −810 to 1,400, P = 0.59), length of stay (7.5 vs. 7, 95% CI −2.7 to 5.1, P = 0.56), or self‐reported measures of disability, activity, and social support. Conclusions: While this trial was a pilot study and not powered to detect a difference between groups, there was no suggestion of any clinically important impact of this financial incentive on postoperative ambulation. While a fully‐powered trial is feasible, given the small range of plausible benefit, such a trial would be unlikely to influence clinical practice.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: Following the completion of their baseline assessment, the participant will be randomly allocated equally to one of two groups using a secure web‐based service. Randomisation will be stratified by trial site, sex, age (=/>25 years), and baseline HbA1c (=/>8.5% [=/>69mmol/mol]): The M3 Intervention – will be delivered by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare practitioners trained specifically by members of the central research team. The intervention will utilise a hybrid approach of digital and face‐to‐face contacts to reduce participant burden. A designated care coordinator at each site will act as a central point of contact for each participant, helping to facilitate consistent, continuous care across the multidisciplinary team. The intervention will be person centred, focusing on what matters most to the participant, which may include traditional (e.g., glucose levels and body weight) and non‐traditional risk factors (e.g., psychosocial/mental wellbeing, self‐management support, and lifestyle). Healthcare professionals will perform personalised drug reviews and may promote the earlier use of newer therapies such as glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) and sodium‐glucose co‐transporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), where appropriate, alongside personalised strategies for dietary, psychological, and physical activity support. Finally, the M3 intervention will make use of novel technology, including wearable devices (glucose sensors and physical activity monitors), online health monitoring reports, and an online health management system, which will facilitate a flexible approach to care and allow easier communication between the participant and the care team. Ongoing standard care – participants will continue receiving standard care under their usual diabe CONDITION: Type 2 diabetes ; Nutritional, Metabolic, Endocrine ; Type 2 diabetes mellitus PRIMARY OUTCOME: Change in HbA1c from baseline to 52 weeks collected by venous blood sampling.

N2  -  Background: Obesity is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, thus work on obesity care related topics is highly connected to further urgent global health related challenges [1‐3]. This research is part of the STOP project, a H2020 RISE project funded by European Commission (GA No 823978) to address the challenge of preventing obesity in Europe [4]. The interdisciplinary European STOP project aims to establish a data and knowledge ecosystem as a basis for the STOP Portal to enable healthcare professionals in decision support, and persons with obesity in analysis and feedback of health information to optimise healthy nutrition. The aim of this current randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to determine the effectiveness of the newly developed system for adults with overweight and obesity to lose weight. Methods: This was a pilot two‐arm RCT: 1. intervention (n=15) and 2. control (n=15). All the participants were adults with overweight or obesity. The intervention group used the STOP Portal, while the control group did not use this system, no intervention. Participants were randomised into one of the two groups using a computer randomised programme. The primary outcome was percentage reported weight loss, including 10% weight loss by three months. Four data collection points for both the intervention and control groups at 1. baseline (month 0); 2. month 1; 3. month 2; and 4. month 3. Regardless, of what group the participants were in, their weight and height were recorded at each of these four data collection points. The STOP Portal collects the following data: physiological data, knowledge resources, biomedical data, self‐reporting activity and food data. Ethical approval was obtained. Results: A total of 30 adults registered for this pilot RCT and participated up to three months. From the preliminary results so far, it suggests that the STOP Portal can collect data on self‐reporting activity and food data, and thus aiding weight lost. It was found that the STOP Portal could provide better support or motivate users better if the users are using wearable wrist bands or apps in monitoring the activities. Conclusion: Overall, the STOP Portal has potential and is deemed acceptable and is fit for purpose to collect data on self‐reporting activity and food data, and contribute to weight management. This project addresses obesity management and prevention through the foundation of an innovative platform to support persons with obesity with a better nutrition under supervision of healthcare professionals.

N2  -  Strong evidence indicates physical activity (PA) reduces risk of bladder, breast, colon, endometrium, esophagus, gastric, and renal cancer, and there is moderate evidence for lung cancer. Individuals aged 25+ who are inactive are at high risk of developing a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, only 1/3 of adults meet guidelines for PA; thus, they are an important group to target. In response, the investigators developed JustWalk, a modular adaptive mobile health (mHealth) intervention that makes daily N‐of‐1 adjustments to support PA for each person. JustWalk can perform N‐of‐1 adaptation based on our innovative use of control engineering methods, which the investigators call a control optimization trial (COT). The YourMove study is a 12‐month 2‐arm randomized control trial (RCT) designed to assess the efficacy of COT methods in 386 adults aged 25+ who are inactive. The investigators will evaluate the differences in minutes/week of moderate‐to‐vigorous intensity PA (MVPA), measured via accelerometers, among the COT‐optimized (intervention) vs. non‐COT intervention designed in accordance with standard of care digital corporate wellness to support physical activity (control) groups at 12 months. The YourMove Study uses a fully integrated system of modalities that include: 1) a popular consumer‐level wearable (e.g., Fitbit Versa) and corresponding app (e.g., the Fitbit app); 2) daily process‐level analyses done using the Fitbit Versa and ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures rooted in social cognitive theory (SCT) constructs to promote behavior change; 3) a highly tailored text messaging system encouraging participants to achieve recommended minutes of physical activity: >150 minutes per week of moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (MVPA); and 4) a self‐study tool called "Reflect", which is meant to support individuals in self‐experimentation to identify strategies that work for them to fit regular MVPA into their lives. The consumer‐level devices and app will be used to self‐monitor behavior, and their data will be passively acquired in real‐time. A variety of self‐reported measures asked daily via EMA enables the measurement of psychosocial factors important for the development of a dynamical SCT model and produces ambitious yet achievable step goals that are adaptive to each individual. Algorithms will be used to automatically deliver text messages to support individually tailored goal setting, performance feedback, and goal review in a highly dynamic style that reflects participants' behavioral progress towards achieving a minimum goal of 150 min/week of MVPA.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome is a predisposing factor for cardiovascular and metabolic disease, but also has socioeconomic relevance by affecting the health and productivity of workers. We tested the effect of regular telemonitoring‐supported physical activity on metabolic syndrome severity and work ability in company employees. METHODS: This was a prospective, randomised, parallel‐group, and assessor‐blind study done in workers in the main Volkswagen factory (Wolfsburg, Germany). Volunteers with diagnosed metabolic syndrome according to American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute criteria were randomly assigned (1:1) to a 6‐month lifestyle intervention focusing on regular exercise (exercise group), or to a waiting‐list control group, using a computer‐based assignment list with variable block length. Participants in the exercise group received individual recommendations for exercise at face‐to‐face meetings and via a smartphone application, with the aim of doing 150 min physical activity per week. Activities were supervised and adapted using activity‐monitor data, which were transferred to a central database. Participants in the control group continued their current lifestyle and were informed about the possibility to receive the supervised intervention after study completion. The primary outcome was the change in metabolic syndrome severity (metabolic syndrome Z score) after 6 months in the intention‐to treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03293264, and is closed to new participants. FINDINGS: 543 individuals were screened between Oct 10, 2017, and Feb 27, 2018, of whom 314 (mean age 48 years [SD 8]) were randomly assigned to receive the intervention (n=160; exercise group) or to a waiting list (n=154; control group). The mean metabolic syndrome Z score for the exercise group was significantly reduced after the 6‐month intervention period (0·93 [SD 0·63] before and 0·63 [0·64] after the intervention) compared with the control group (0·95 [0·55] and 0·90 [0·61]; difference between groups ‐0·26 [95% CI ‐0·35 to ‐0·16], p<0·0001). We documented 11 adverse events in the exercise group, with only one event (a twisted ankle) regarded as directly caused by the intervention. INTERPRETATION: A 6‐month exercise‐focused intervention using telemonitoring systems reduced metabolic syndrome severity. This form of intervention shows significant potential to reduce disease risk, while also improving mental health, work ability, and productivity‐related outcomes for employees at high risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. FUNDING: Audi BKK health insurance and the German Research Foundation through the Cluster of Excellence REBIRTH.

N2  -  Purpose: The care of patients undergoing cardiac surgery is becoming more complex, owing to increased burdens of comorbid disease, frailty, psychosocial issues and complex pathology. Cardiac rehabilitation is a well‐established way to improve the outcomes of patients after a cardiac event or cardiac surgery but is a highly reactive approach. Cardiac prehabilitation on the other hand is proactive and evidence suggests that improving aerobic conditioning, respiratory muscle training, lifestyle modification, diabetic control and sleep may improve outcomes. There are however barriers to implementing these changes which may be overcome with a carefully designed program. Methods: All adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery electively with a minimum wait period of 4‐weeks prior to surgery will be recruited in absence of exclusion criteria. They will be randomised to the intervention or conventional care. The intervention is a multidisciplinary led (cardiac surgery, anaesthesia, intensive care, exercise physiology, psychology and nursing) intervention that is a home‐based walking program. Subjects will be recruited on the day of their first appointment and all face‐to‐face follow‐ups will be done at the same time as pre‐existing appointments to minimise cost to patient and hospital. Patients will be provided with an accelerometer wearable device (FitBit) to measure exercise and provided with motivational support and information via social media (a closed Facebook group) and text messaging. Geographical concerns have been alleviated by the use of a home‐based program and have applicability to Australian populations with rural and remote patients. Results: Primary outcomes are Days Alive Out of Hospital at 90 days and length of stay. Secondary outcomes include cost of stay, cardiometabolic markers, motivation to exercise, quality of life, attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. Conclusions: The optimal cardiac prehabiliation program remains unclear but whatever it looks like, a low‐cost, home‐based and scalable program has promising applicability to Australian patients. Specifically targeting modifiable perioperative risk factors may reduce adverse outcomes after surgery.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) have deficits in sensory and motor skills leading to inadequate proprioceptive feedback, impaired postural balance and higher fall risk. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effect of sensor‐based interactive balance training on postural stability and daily physical activity in older adults with diabetes. METHODS: Thirty‐nine older adults with DPN were enrolled (age 63.7 ± 8.2 years, BMI 30.6 ± 6, 54% females) and randomized to either an intervention (IG) or a control (CG) group. The IG received sensor‐based interactive exercise training tailored for people with diabetes (twice a week for 4 weeks). The exercises focused on shifting weight and crossing virtual obstacles. Body‐worn sensors were implemented to acquire kinematic data and provide real‐time joint visual feedback during the training. Outcome measurements included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during a balance test while the eyes were open and closed at baseline and after the intervention. Daily physical activities were also measured during a 48‐hour period at baseline and at follow‐up. Analysis of covariance was performed for the post‐training outcome comparison. RESULTS: Compared with the CG, the patients in the IG showed a significantly reduced CoM sway (58.31%; p = 0.009), ankle sway (62.7%; p = 0.008) and hip joint sway (72.4%; p = 0.017) during the balance test with open eyes. The ankle sway was also significantly reduced in the IG group (58.8%; p = 0.037) during measurements while the eyes were closed. The number of steps walked showed a substantial but nonsignificant increase (+27.68%; p = 0.064) in the IG following training. CONCLUSION: The results of this randomized controlled trial demonstrate that people with DPN can significantly improve their postural balance with diabetes‐specific, tailored, sensor‐based exercise training. The results promote the use of wearable technology in exercise training; however, future studies comparing this technology with commercially available systems are required to evaluate the benefit of interactive visual joint movement feedback.

N2  -  Objectives: It is currently thought that most—but not all—individuals infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 develop symptoms, but that the infectious period starts on average two days before the first overt symptoms appear. It is estimated that pre‐ and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre‐symptomatic individuals. Using laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (detected via serology tests [to determine if there are antibodies against the SARS‐CoV‐2 in the blood] or SARS‐CoV‐2 infection tests such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the following two algorithms to detect first time SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection:the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self‐reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition)the algorithm using self‐reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition) In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS‐CoV‐2 virus testing. Trial design: The trial is a randomized, single‐blinded, two‐period, two‐sequence crossover trial. All subjects will participate in an initial Learning Phase (varying from 2 weeks to 3 months depending on enrolment date), followed by two contiguous 3‐month test phases, Period 1 and Period 2. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in one of these periods and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or Sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high‐risk and normal‐risk group within each sequence. Participants: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high‐risk and normal‐risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6,500 normal‐risk individuals and 3,500 high‐risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID‐RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID‐RED web portal, and self‐sampling serology and PCR kits. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID‐RED web portal (www.covid‐red.eu). After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID‐RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria:Resident of the NetherlandsAt least 18 years oldInformed consent provided (electronic)Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocolMust have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, study team should be notified)Be able to read, understand and write Dutch Exclusion criteria:Previous positive SARS‐CoV‐2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self‐reported)Previously received a vaccine developed specifically for COVID‐19 or in possession of an appointment for vaccination in the near future (self‐reported)Current suspected (e.g., waiting for test result) COVID‐19 infection or symptoms of a COVID‐19 infection (self‐reported)Participating in any other COVID‐19 clinical drug, vaccine, or medical device trial (self‐reported)Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self‐reported)Pregnant at time of informed consent (self‐reported)Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelet’s User Manual; self‐reported)Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study Intervention and comparator: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID‐RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronise it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self‐reported symptom data within the last 24 hours, the Ava COVID‐RED app’s underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real‐time indicator of their overall health and well‐being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that: no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self‐isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID‐19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). Main outcomes: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID‐RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature, and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS‐CoV‐2 in general and high‐risk populations. Using laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first‐time SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava Bracelet data when coupled with the self‐reported Daily Symptom Diary data, and the algorithm using self‐reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS‐CoV‐2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS‐CoV‐2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional seventeen secondary outcomes which address infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS‐CoV‐2 infected participants, and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS‐CoV‐2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID‐19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme, and report the testing result in the Ava COVID‐RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self‐sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial‐affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (Month 0), and at the end of the Learning Phase (Month 3), Period 1 (Month 6) and Period 2 (Month 9). These samples will be used for SARS‐CoV‐2‐specific antibody testing in a trial‐affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID‐19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the Learning Phase is positive, and samples collected at the end of Period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of Period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so‐called “COVID‐positive” mode in the Ava COVID‐RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using data collected in Period 2 (Month 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after Period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. Randomisation: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high‐risk and normal‐risk group within each sequence, resulting in equal numbers of high‐risk and normal‐risk individuals between the sequences. Blinding (masking): In this study, subjects will be blinded as to study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID‐RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID‐RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or Sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6,500 normal‐risk and 3,500 high‐risk individuals per sequence.

N2  -  Introduction: Peripheral artery disease is the third most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide, with over 200 million people affected, while smoking and diabetes being the strongest risk factors. The most prominent symptom is leg pain while walking known as intermittent claudication, as the muscles do not get enough blood during exercise to meet the needs. To improve mobility, first line treatment for intermittent claudication are outpatient supervised exercise programs; however, their implementation face manifold challenges: low patient adherence, no reimbursement by insurers, high costs of course implementation, and low course availability. These barriers led to the development of home‐based exercise programs, which are similarly effective when combined with a structured approach by setting exercise goals, monitoring exercise activity, and regular follow up with a coach. Therefore, this trial aims to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of TeGeCoach, a 12‐month long structured home‐based exercise program, compared to the routine care of intermittent claudication. Materials & Methods: A prospective, open‐label, multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TeGeCoach. 4630 patients with peripheral artery disease at Fontaine stage II, identified from three statutory health insurers in Germany, will be randomly assigned either to TeGeCoach or Treatment as Usual (routine care). TeGeCoach consists of a telephone‐based health coaching to strengthen health literacy, remote walking exercise monitoring with the use of a wearable activity tracker (telemonitoring), and intensified primary care. Depending on the individual functional status and exercise capacity, participants will be asked to walk up to seven times a week. Primary outcomes are functional capacity measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, alongside with total health care costs based upon routine health insurance data. Secondary outcome measures include quality of life, health literacy and health behavior. Outcomes will be measured at three time points (0, 12, and 24 months). To address dropouts appropriately, an intention‐to‐treat analysis strategy with multiple imputation of missing values will be employed. Differences between the groups will be identified by means of mixed effects models. Discussion: Clearly, the current routine care of intermittent claudication is partly ineffective und insufficient, with the consequence of a poorly served patient population and worsening disease condition. TeGeCoach may provide an effective and feasible alternative in the management of intermittent claudication by improving access to supervised exercise while at the same time potentially reducing health care costs.

N2  -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative treatment option for patients with hematologic conditions but presents many complications that must be managed as a complex, chronic condition. Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) may permit tracking of symptoms in HCT. In seeking strategies to manage the complexities of HCT, our team collaborated with Sicklesoft, Inc., to develop an mHealth app specifically for HCT patients to allow for daily evaluation of patient health, Technology Recordings to better Understand Bone Marrow Transplantation (TRU‐BMT). The primary value of this application is that of potentially enhancing the monitoring of symptoms and general health of patients undergoing HCT, with the ultimate goal of allowing earlier detection of adverse events, earlier intervention, and improving outcomes. To first evaluate patient interest in mHealth apps, we designed and administered an interest survey to patients at the 2017 BMT‐InfoNet reunion. As a follow‐up to the positive feedback received, we began testing the TRU‐BMT app in a Phase 1 pilot study. Thirty patients were enrolled in this single‐arm study and were given the TRU‐BMT mHealth app on a smartphone device in addition to a wearable activity tracker. Patients were followed for up to 180 days, all the while receiving daily app monitoring. Adherence to TRU‐BMT was approximately 30% daily and 44% weekly, and greater adherence was associated with increased meal completion, decreased heart rate, and shorter hospital stay. TRU‐BMT assessments of symptom severity were significantly associated with duration of hospital stay and development of chronic graft‐versus‐host disease. Our findings suggest that using TRU‐BMT throughout HCT is feasible for patients and established a proof‐of‐concept for a future randomized control trial of the TRU‐BMT application in HCT. © 2021 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth abnormalities and often leads to death in childhood. Recently, elamipretide has been tested as a potential first disease‐modifying drug. This study aimed to identify patients with BTHS who may respond to elamipretide, based on continuous physiological measurements acquired through wearable devices. RESULTS: Data from a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover trial of 12 patients with BTHS were used, including physiological time series data measured using a wearable device (heart rate, respiratory rate, activity, and posture) and functional scores. The latter included the 6‐minute walk test (6MWT), Patient‐Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue score, SWAY Balance Mobile Application score (SWAY balance score), BTHS Symptom Assessment (BTHS‐SA) Total Fatigue score, muscle strength by handheld dynamometry, 5 times sit‐and‐stand test (5XSST), and monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin ratio (MLCL:CL). Groups were created through median split of the functional scores into "highest score" and "lowest score", and "best response to elamipretide" and "worst response to elamipretide". Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) models were implemented to assess whether physiological data could classify patients according to functional status and distinguish non‐responders from responders to elamipretide. AHC models clustered patients according to their functional status with accuracies of 60‐93%, with the greatest accuracies for 6MWT (93%), PROMIS (87%), and SWAY balance score (80%). Another set of AHC models clustered patients with respect to their response to treatment with elamipretide with perfect accuracy (all 100%). CONCLUSIONS: In this proof‐of‐concept study, we demonstrated that continuously acquired physiological measurements from wearable devices can be used to predict functional status and response to treatment among patients with BTHS.

N2  -  Background: Modern advances in miniaturized ultrasound and wireless mobile health (mHealth) technologies represent promising methods to diagnose the severity of structural heart disease (SHD) at the point‐of‐care (POC). The current study assessed the integration of smartphone‐based mHealth devices with handheld echocardiography (handheld‐echo) for characterizing the severity of disease in patients with rheumatic valvular heart disease (Rh‐VHD). Methods: We prospectively randomized 252 Rh‐ VHD patients referred to a tertiary care out patient clinic to assessments at 5 mHealth clinics (n=138 patients) or 5 standard of care clinics (Standard‐care, n=114 patients). The mHealth clinics were equipped with a handheld‐echo, the smartphone connected iECG, and blood pressure monitor, wearable activity trackers and POC‐BNP levels for functional assessments. The Standard‐care clinics included physical assessments and diagnostic testing as clinically indicated. All patients underwent echocardiography for assessing the severity of Rh‐VHD. We compared the integration of mHealth devices with standard‐care for predicting the need for valvuloplasty, valve replacement, hospitalization or death over 1 year in a non‐inferiority design (figure). Results: Overall, the mHealth and the Standard‐care groups demonstrated a similar incidence of Rh‐VDH (68% vs. 64%, p=0.68) and a similar incidence of severe mitral (26% vs. 26%, p=0.92) or aortic valvular abnormalities (10% vs. 11%, p=0.24). Handheld‐echo diagnosed mitral or aortic valve disease in 66% and 36% of mHealth patients, respectively. mHealth diagnostics further revealed abnormal cardiac rhythm in 27%, functional impairment on activity monitoring in 88% and a mean BNP of 85 ± 25 pg/mL. The referral rate for treatment was higher in the mHealth group as compared to the Standard‐care group, 27% vs. 19%, p=0.001. During a median follow up of 6‐months, the composite outcome for treatment was seen in 49 patients in the mHealth group and 38 patients in the Standard‐care group (hazard ratio for the mHealth group 1.24 (95% CI 0.9 ‐ 1.42, p= 0.13 for noninferiority).

KW  -  Heart Failure
N2  -  Heart failure is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States and in Western Europe. However, patient etiology and prognosis varies considerably, and guidance about how to best treat patients has relied on large clinical trials that only include snapshots of the syndrome (at the time the patient interaction with the healthcare system). It remains to be seen whether behavioral interventions can improve patient engagement, increase self‐management of the conditions, and thus improve overall clinical outcomes. Digital health technologies have a great potential to streamline and optimize the clinical management of heart failure. Such technologies can take the form of mobile applications or wearable devices that may provide both patients and providers with valuable real‐time information about patient status and cardiovascular health, provide automated patient‐tailored coaching and motivational tools, or a mix of both. Integration of these technologies into healthcare systems may allow for genuine engagement of the patient in their own care and management of their disease and/or enhance clinical decision making. To date, no prior study has comprehensively examined the ability of digital heath technologies to improve self‐management of heart failure or subsequent clinical outcomes. This study is an unblinded, 5‐arm, parallel group randomized controlled trial to measure the efficacy of four digital health technologies in improving the management of care and quality of life of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Patients enrolled in one of Yale's Disease Management Clinics for management of their CHF will be eligible for this study and approached for consent. Enrolled subjects will be randomized to one of five groups: a control (usual care) arm, or to one of four intervention arms, each of which assesses one of four digital health technologies. These technologies are: ‐ BodyPort: A data‐driven smart scale that provides enhanced cardiac monitoring and risk assessment data. ‐ EKO: An advanced stethoscope providing EKG and sound monitoring. ‐ Noom: A live, data‐driven coaching application providing personalized diet and weight management. ‐ Conversa: An automated conversational platform providing patient motivation and educational tools for CHF management. Patients will be enrolled in the study for 6 months. The first three months will involve active clinic management, while the final three months will involve patient follow‐up via monthly check‐ins (via phone calls) from providers. The primary outcome is the rate of improvement in quality of life after 90 days post‐enrollment, as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ). A variety of prespecified secondary outcomes will be measured to determine effects on patient outcomes, quality of care, clinical efficiency, and provider and patient satisfaction with the product.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: E02.041.625 E02.041.625.591 This is a randomized, unblinded clinical trial of a multicentric character, whose research center is the University of Santa Cruz do Sul (Santa Cruz do Sul ‐ RS), with the Santa Cruz Hospital (HSC) as the center for carrying out the research. For the present study, an adapted Owner mask (Group VNI Owner) will be used, which will be compared to the conventional orofacial mask (Group VNI orofacial) in patients of both sexes (18 to 90 years old) with and without suspicion or confirmation of COVID‐19 and with criteria for the institution of non‐invasive ventilation (NIV). The sample will be recruited non‐probabilistically and for convenience, in which patients will be selected who meet the criteria for NIV institution, according to the Brazilian Association of Intensive Medicine (AMIB) (AMIB, 2020). The study will not be blinded to measure measures and outcomes. The calculated sample size is based on an intubation rate of 30.2% for patients with COVID who require mechanical ventilation (GOLD et al., 2020), we estimate that a total of 126 patients (63 in each group) would provide 80% power to detect an absolute reduction of 20% of the primary result (ANTONELLI et al., 2001), with the adoption of a two‐tailed model and a significance level of 0.05. Assuming a loss of follow‐up of 20%, 141 patients will be recruited. Assuming an intubation rate of 61% for patients with acute respiratory syndrome who require mechanical ventilation (THILLE et al., 2013), we calculated that a total of 194 (97 in each group) patients would provide 80% power to detect an absolute reduction 20% of the primary result (ANTONELLI et al., 2001), with the adoption of a two‐tailed model and a significance level of 0.05. Assuming a loss of follow‐up of 20%, 204 patients will be recruited. Th CONDITION: Acute Respiratory Failure; Respiratory Failure CID 10 J98 SP4.001.012.143 PRIMARY OUTCOME: Such a primary outcome will be assessed by the number of patients involved in the research who underwent orotracheal intubation until the end of the study. SECONDARY OUTCOME: ‐ In‐hospital mortality [Period: up to 30 days]. Evaluated by the number of deaths that occurred within 30 days after the patient's involvement in the study. ; ‐ Differences in RPaO2 / FiO2 in relation to the baseline values (before NIV) [Period: 48 h]. Calculated using the ratio between PaO2 and FiO2 displaced by arterial blood gases. ; ‐ Improvement of RPaO2 / FiO2 after the beginning of NIV [Period: 1 h after NIV]. ; ‐ PaCO2 levels [Period: 1 to 24 h after NIV]. Obtained by collecting arterial blood gases in 1 to 24 h after the initiation of NIV. ; ‐ Blood pressure (BP) and increased hypotension (SBP <80 mmHg or mean arterial pressure <60 mmHg) [Period: up to 24 hours after NIV]. Measured by indirect and continuous blood pressure measurement. ; ‐ Time between the beginning of NIV and its end (moment of resolution of respiratory failure). Measured through the time between the NIV institution and its end, ; ‐ Time in the intensive care unit [time period: up to 30 days]. Measured by the number of days the patient stayed in the ICU. ; ‐ Length of hospital stay of patients who used NIV. Measured by the number of days between admission and discharge from hospital or death. ; ‐ Adverse effects of the mask: pressure ulcers, skin necrosis, air leak per mask, eye inflammation, gastric distention. Measured using the Questionnaire on acute adverse effects of the NIV mask. ; ‐ Classification of patient comfort with the mask. Numerical rating scale ranging from 0 (light) to 10 (intense) (Visual analogue scale (VAS)) [Period: appear on pre‐hospital discharge]. ; ‐ Level of satisfaction after using NIV. Image through the Global Impression of Patient Change Questionnaire (PGIC). ; ‐ NIV success rate with Owner mask or conventional orofacial mask. Success is defined as non‐evolution to IOT [Deadline: 1 h since the beginning of NIV]. ; ‐ Ventilatory variables: tidal volume (CV), minute volume (MV), peak pressure (Peak), FR, FiO2, inspiratory time (Ti), expiratory time (Te), air leakage (Leak), inspiratory minute volume (VMi ), expiratory minute volume (MVe) obtained in NIV with Owner mask and conventional face mask [Period: 1 hour after NIV]. Such variables will be obtained automatically on the mechanical fan display. ; ‐ SARS‐CoV2 contamination in the HEPA filter of the Owner mask and the conventional orofacial mask in NIV. Such measures will be carried out through the collection and processing of the filters used in the facial masks and through the extraction of RNA and RT‐PCR. ; INCLUSION CRITERIA: ‐ Patients with or without suspicion or confirmation of infection by SARS‐CoV‐2, of both sexes and aged between 18 and 90 years in acute respiratory failure (ARF)and with indication for the institution of non‐invasive ventilation. ‐ Patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (GOLD IV) with hypercapnic ARF with or without suspicion or confirmation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. ‐ Patients with congestive heart failure (NYHA 4) with or without suspected or confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

N2  -  Introduction Neutropenic fever following high‐dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a common (incidence 63‐100%) and potentially life‐threatening complication. Recommended time to antibiotic (TTA) administration is within 1 hr of fever onset with delays associated with significant morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality. Standard of care guidelines emphasize patient self‐monitoring for fever, with instructions to seek immediate medical attention if body temperature (temp) reaches 100.4°F or higher. In this study, we evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temp monitor, tPatch, could reliably estimate core body temp and detect fever in an outpatient setting following ASCT. Additionally, we gathered preliminary data to explore early detection and prediction of clinically relevant temp rise in this clinical setting. Methods Patients (N = 86) with hematologic malignancies (62% multiple myeloma) who underwent high‐dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT at Mayo Clinic, MN were prospectively enrolled between June 2018 and March 2019. Patients (82% male) wore an axilla‐placed tPatch continuously for 7 days in an outpatient setting during the post ASCT period and were asked to record self‐measured oral temp in 3‐4 hr intervals daily using a standardized thermometer after appropriate training . Patients followed standard of care procedures with daily clinic assessment of temp, blood counts, and vital signs. An optional patient questionnaire was given at end‐of‐study. A model was trained using both patientand clinic‐assessed oral temp measures to estimate core temp from 2 sensors on the tPatch device. Core temp estimates and trends were then compared to patient‐ and clinic‐assessed measurements. Fever was defined as a temperature ≥100.4°F for at least 1 hr. Results When compared to all oral temp reads, the tPatch estimated core temp within 0.03 ± 0.7°F. Among the 86 patients, clinic‐assessed fever incidence was 29.4% while tPatch‐assessed incidence was 58.8%. Using all clinic‐recorded temp readings as “ground truth,” the sensitivity and specificity of the tPatch algorithm in detecting fevers were 88% and 86%, respectively, while patient self fever detection sensitivity was 62% and specificity 93%. With “fever episode” defined as a temp ≥100.4°F for at least 1 hr, tPatch detected 9.6 times the number of fever episodes vs. clinic reads. The average lead time of tPatch detection of clinic‐recorded fevers was 3.7 hours. In 25% of all intervals between clinic temp readings, either tPatch or patients detected at least 1 fever episode. The tPatch was well‐tolerated, the only adverse events reported were grade 1 skin irritation and discomfort in 4 (5%) patients. Of 65 patients who completed the survey, 95% reported the tPatch as “quite” or “somewhat” comfortable and 94% stated no difficulty in using the tPatch. Exploration of tPatch temp trends over various time intervals for use in fever prediction is ongoing. Conclusions Patient self‐monitoring of temp has low sensitivity and is not feasible for long intervals of time (e.g., overnight). Continuous temperature monitoring by a wearable device overcomes these challenges and has the potential to improve early detection and consequently shorten time to antibiotic initiation. A follow‐up randomized study is planned to assess the clinical benefits of continuous temp monitoring through patient and clinician alerts triggering early clinical intervention for febrile neutropenia.

N2  -  INTERVENTION: The intervention arm will receive a Fitbit to use to monitor physical activity for the duration of the 12‐week intervention. Participants who are randomised to the intervention arm will also attend two group sessions which will target goal‐setting and action‐planning skills. The treatment group will be able to collect the Fitbit post‐randomisation. Participants will be able to pick the Fitbit up from the hospital, signing it out upon collection at their first group meeting. They will be asked to wear the Fitbit as much as possible during the 12‐week intervention (at least 8 hours per day, preferably all waking hours), and will be encouraged to download Fitbit software that will assist in tracking their physical activity. Use of the Fitbits will provide participants with a practical and convenient method for monitoring their activity. Throughout the 12‐week intervention, participants in the treatment group will be required to attend two 1‐hour group sessions. The first group session will be held in week 1, and the second in week 4 of the study. Session one will focus on introducing participants to the Fitbit and giving instructions on how to use this device as a self‐monitoring tool. Participants will complete goal‐setting worksheets (Appendix F ‐ attached to ANZCTR registration form) to set their activity goals for the following 12 weeks. Behaviour change specialists SH and CMS will assist participants with effective action planning, goal‐setting and self‐monitoring. Session two will attend to support needs and help participants to plan for and overcome barriers to increasing their physical activity level. Participants will also be able to adjust previously established goals, if necessary. This session will also allow for trouble‐shooting of any problems or queries that participants encounter regarding Fitbit wear and use. Participants will take all worksheets from the sessions home with them, to assist with achieving their goals. At the end of the 12‐week intervention, all participants should have completed two group sessions. Although this is not required, it is recommended that participants will also meet and build rapport with other participants in their neighbourhood outside of the meetings to boost their support and provide a sense of accountability. A final booster message will be sent to participants via text message or email (according to participant preference) at week 6. In keeping with the theme of self‐monitoring and support needs, this booster message will contain a brief note of encouragement and a recommendation to track physical activity, with the aim of meeting the government guidelines. Participants will attend their end of intervention assessment at 12 weeks. At 24 weeks (twelve weeks post‐intervention), participants will attend their final follow‐up assessment. Participants will be required to return their Fitbit within the fortnight following the 24‐week intervention. Following completion of the trial, participants will be invited to give feed back on effective components of the intervention via semi‐structured interviews. CONDITION: cancer cardiovascular risk PRIMARY OUTCOME: Minutes of activity per week as measured by accelerometer wear for 7 days. Minutes of sedentary time as measured by accelerometer wear for 7 days. ; Interviews will be guided by the following questions: ; • Thank you very much for participating in the project, please could you tell me a bit about how you got on with the project? ; • Which aspects of the projects were most useful/less useful? And why? ; • What did you learn or achieve from participating in the project? ; • Did you achieve your goals? What were they? ; • In an ideal world, what would the perfect exercise project look like? What kind of support do you feel would be the most effective? How could the project be improved And why? SECONDARY OUTCOME: BMI as measured by weight & height, which will be assessed by study investigators at hospital using scales. Effectiveness of intervention based on semi‐structured qualitative interview feedback. ; • There were several components to the project; the Fitbit Alta device, the APP, the group sessions, the booklet containing action planning sheets, goal‐setting sheets etc.; we’re keen to understand which aspects were the most effective or least effective for increasing your physical activity? ; • Interviewer to check whether participants understood/took in the importance of ‘intensity’ and 10‐minute bouts over the steps message. ‘What was the main message concerning how much physical activity you should be doing in a day or week’? ; • You’ve had to give back the Fitbit that you have for 6‐months; did you buy your own? How are you getting on now in terms of your physical activity level? Are you measuring your physical activity progress? ; • Did you during the project or are you now doing any of the strength‐based exercises that Sarah and Chloe demonstrated or those contained in the booklet? ; • What are the main influences on your physical activity level? ; • What are the main barriers to maintaining or achieving a physically active lifestyle? ; • Have you received any advice/support from the oncology team re: the importance of physical activity? If yes then what have you been advised and what resources have you been given? ; • Do you have any further comments or questions? ; Thanks for your time. Minutes of physical activity per week as measured by accelerometer wear for 7 days. Minutes of sedentary time as measured by accelerometer wear for 7 days. Physical activity MET minutes per week as measured by IPAQ‐SF. Quality of life as measured by MOS‐SF.

N2  -  Background: Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly. A critical limitation is that they use data collected up until the time of discharge but do not leverage information on patient behaviors at home after discharge. Methods: PREDICT is a two‐arm, randomized trial comparing ways to use remotely‐monitored patient activity levels after hospital discharge to improve hospital readmission prediction models. Patients are randomly assigned to use a wearable device or smartphone application to track physical activity data. The study collects also validated assessments on patient characteristics as well as disparate data on credit scores and medication adherence. Patients are followed for 6 months. We evaluate whether these data sources can improve prediction compared to standard modelling approaches. Conclusion: The PREDICT Trial tests a novel method of remotely‐monitoring patient behaviors after hospital discharge. Findings from the trial could inform new ways to improve the identification of patients at high‐risk for hospital readmission. Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02983812

N2  -  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. Symptoms of COPD often restricts exercise capacity and activities of daily life of patients. Accordingly, patients with symptomatic COPD have reduced health‐related quality of life, which leads to substantial socioeconomic burden. In order to overcome the limitation associated with COPD pharmacotherapy, the need for a combination of nonpharmacologic therapies, including pulmonary rehabilitation has been suggested constantly. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a method of relieving respiratory distress symptoms through exhalation and inspiratory training, improving exercise ability and contributes in improving lung function and overall quality of life. Nevertheless, compliance of pulmonary rehabilitation in daily life is low in most COPD patients. Thus, we applied wearable device to detect and evaluate application, compliance and effectiveness pulmonary rehabilitation program in COPD patients, according to the patients' characteristics. Moreover, we sought to use the results of this study as a basic data to establish a strategy for a customized education program for each patient that can be applied to non‐face‐to‐face digital therapeutics in the future.

N2  -  Introduction: Frequent premature beats may significantly increase the risk of heart failure and death by inducing arrhythmia‐induced cardiomyopathy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most important and convenient diagnostic tool for heart diseases, but the heart disease patient’s ECG is very complex and needs an experienced cardiologist to interpret correctly. In this research, we studied the detection of PVC using recurrent neural networks with ECG big data obtained by wearable medical devices used by non‐cardiologists. Through the validation with MIT‐BIH arrhythmia database, we obtained an accuracy of 95‐99%. Methods: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is used to learn feature representation of ECG signals. We treat the ECG signal as 1D sequences each including 3 heart beats. Then we build a 5‐layer RNN mainly including a long short‐term memory (LSTM) layer, and two fully‐connected layers. The RNN is trained by 16259 training sequences and tested by 500 randomly selected testing sequences. Results: The detection performance is evaluated by three standard metrics: accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we obtained an average accuracy of 95%‐99%, a sensitivity of 99%‐100%, and a specificity of 94%‐96%. Discussion and Conclusion: In this research, we have implemented a fully automated PVC detection method based on RNN and got excellent detection accuracies for different patients by using the same neural networks. This system may assist physicians to interpret ECG for the diagnosis of arrhythmias. In addition, RNN may also be used for online PVC detection from ECG measured by wearable medical devices to promote the healthcare of human beings in casual life.

N2  -  INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cause of stroke and a marker of atherosclerosis and of all patients with stroke, around 17% have AF. The screening and treatment of AF could prevent about 12% of all strokes. Several relatively low‐cost devices with good accuracy now exist which can detect AF including WatchBP and AliveCor. However, they can only measure the ECG or pulse over short time periods. Inexpensive devices such as heart rate monitors, which are widely available, can measure heart rate for prolonged periods and may have potential in screening for AF. This study aims to determine the accuracy of AliveCor and WatchBP along with a bespoke algorithm using a heart rate monitor belt (Polar H7) and a wearable RR interval recorder (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2) for detecting AF during a single screening visit in primary care patients. METHODS/ANALYSIS: A multicentre case‐control diagnostic study comparing the four different devices for the detection of AF with a reference standard consisting of a 12‐lead ECG in GP surgeries across Hampshire, UK. We aim to recruit 92 participants with AF and 329 without AF aged 65 years and over. We will ask participants to rate comfort and overall impression for each device. We will collect qualitative data from participants capturing their experience of using wearable devices in order to evaluate acceptability. We will collect data from GPs to determine their views on AF screening. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol was approved by the London‐City & East Research Ethics Committee in June 2016. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer‐reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and the Atrial Fibrillation Association, UK.

N2  -  The overarching aim of this project is to evaluate the impact of adding a novel digitally‐delivered wellbeing intervention, namely the Heart Health Yoga (HHY) program, on overall wellbeing and quality of life (QoL), cardiovascular risk markers, adherence to therapy, sleep quality, and recurrent hospitalizations amongst ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation (CR). This aim will be addressed through the following objectives: Objective 1: Assess the clinical efficacy of the added digitally delivered HHY program compared to standard psychosocial intervention alone on overall wellbeing and QoL amongst IHD patients undergoing CR. Aim 1 (Primary): To evaluate and compare the impact of the added digitally delivered HHY program versus standard psychosocial intervention alone on wellbeing and QoL, as assessed using the MacNew heart disease questionnaire, amongst IHD patients undergoing CR. Objective 2: Assess the benefit of the added digitally delivered HHY program compared to standard psychosocial intervention alone on cardio‐metabolic risk, therapy adherence, sleep quality, and recurrent hospitalization amongst IHD patients undergoing CR. Aim 2 (Secondary): Assess and compare the impact of the added digitally delivered HHY program versus standard psychosocial intervention alone on cardio‐metabolic risk (i.e. hs‐CRP, AM cortisol, body weight, waist circumference, heart rate and blood pressure), therapy adherence (via weekly compliance questionnaire for HHY group, Medication Adherence Report Scale [MARS‐5], Fitbit activity tracker), exercise capacity (6 minute walk test) and muscular strength (hand grip testing), sleep quality (measured using Fitbit), and recurrent hospitalizations (determined by 1 year hospital re‐admission rates) amongst IHD patients undergoing CR. Hypothesis: Amongst IHD patients undergoing CR, compared to current standard psychosocial interventions addition of a digitally delivered wellbeing technology will result in: 1) greater improvements in overall wellbeing and quality of life; 2) a more profound reduction in cardio‐metabolic risk; 3) greater therapy adherence and improved sleep quality; 4) greater increase in physical activity and/or exercise capacity; and 5) reduced incidence of recurrent hospitalizations. Innovation: There is sparse evidence available on digitally delivered psychosocial interventions for CR patients. A recent meta‐analysis highlighted the feasibility and benefits of web and mobile‐based delivery of cardiac rehabilitation interventions on healthy lifestyle changes, quality of life and re‐hospitalizations; however, the evidence was of low‐moderate quality. The authors also highlighted the limited evidence pertaining to psychological wellbeing and overall cardiovascular risk markers [23]. Yet another meta‐analysis concluded that while eHealth is a feasible option for secondary prevention amongst patients with coronary artery disease, much heterogeneity remains regarding modes of delivery and outcome assessment. Only 6 out of 24 studies in this meta‐analysis looked at psychosocial outcomes in addition to other traditional cardiovascular outcomes [24]. Based on the aforementioned considerations, it is clear that despite the potential clinical efficacy of well delivered psychosocial interventions on overall wellbeing, QoL, CV risk and outcomes, the direct impact of such interventions are chronically understudied. This will be the first study to assess the impact of individually delivered digital wellbeing technology namely "Heart Health Yoga (HHY)", on wellbeing and QoL improvement amongst IHD patients undergoing CR. Approach: The Mayo Clinic CP Rehab program graduates 200 cardiovascular disease patients per year, 35% being post‐PCI. We will recruit a convenience sample of these patients' over 12 months. Patients who consent to take part in this research will be allocated at random (1:1) to one of two groups: 1) cardiac rehabilitation plus "Heart Health Yoga (HHY)" or 2) cardiac rehabilitation with standard psychosocial education component. We will exclude those with cognitive impairment or those on antipsychotic medications. In addition to routine CR baseline assessments, baseline wellbeing and QoL will be assessed using the MacNew heart disease questionnaire. Outcome measures upon completion of CR will include changes in 1) Wellbeing/QoL scores, 2) Cardio‐metabolic markers (hs‐CRP, cortisol, body weight, waist circumference, BP, HR); 3) Therapy adherence (via weekly compliance questionnaire for HHY group, Medication Adherence Report Scale [MARS‐5], Fitbit step tracker), exercise capacity (measured by 6 min walk distance) and muscular strength (measured by hand grip testing), 4) Sleep quality (measured using Fitbit) & 4) Recurrent hospitalizations at 1 year Methods: This is a prospective single blind randomized pilot study comparing the effects of digitally delivered HHY program vs. standard psychosocial intervention on wellbeing/QoL, cardio‐metabolic risk markers, therapy adherence and recurrent hospitalizations amongst IHD patients undergoing CP rehab. Eligible participants will be recruited at their first CR visit with prospective enrollment. Recruitment: Patients will be recruited for the study at the time of their first visit to cardiac rehabilitation. Cardiac rehabilitation staff will offer patients the option to participate in the study and obtain consent. Participants will need to consent to blood draws before and after the study. Enrollment: Interested participants will be scheduled for an initial appointment to confirm eligibility criteria, obtain consent, randomization and baseline testing Visit 1. Randomization will be done stratified on Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) categories (mild = CCI 1‐2; moderate = CCI 3‐4; severe = CCI 5 or more). To ensure near balance in the number of patients in each study arm throughout the trial, we will used blocked randomization within each CCI category randomization patients to either HHY or standard of care in a 1:1 fashion with random block sizes of 2 or 4 patients. Investigators and statistician will be blinded to participant groups until after study completion and analysis of the primary endpoint. Consent: Participants must sign the informed consent form prior to being enrolled in the study. Assignment: Participants will be assigned to one of the two CR groups (online HHY intervention + Standard psychosocial intervention or standard psychosocial intervention only control group). ‐ The HHY + Standard psychosocial care group participants will complete 6 online modules (12‐25 minutes in length) sequentially on their own time between weeks 3‐5. The length of time to perform all the recommended Hatha Yoga practices daily will be less than 30 minutes. For the 12‐week duration of the study, Hatha Yoga Practices will be completed at least once daily. It is recommended for the participants to perform guided meditation sessions at least twice weekly. There will be 2 online group sessions available to participants for guided practice sessions. These will be timed between weeks 6‐7. ‐ The control group is the standard psychosocial care group who will receive standard brief education/advice on psychosocial wellbeing and stress reduction. Baseline testing Visit 1: Once consented, subjects will undergo a baseline assessment. Baseline testing will be performed 1‐2 weeks prior to the start of digital HHY training. Baseline data collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, 6 minute walk test distance, overnight fasting blood draw (cardio‐metabolic biomarkers), resting blood pressure and heart rate, hand grip testing and questionnaires (Table 1). Most of the study activities will occur in CR. Baseline questionnaires will include‐ MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication adherence Report Scale [MARS‐5], Brief Resilience Scale and Adverse Childhood Experience questionaire. Questionnaires will be completed electronically (i.e. REDCap) or on paper. Paper data will be securely stored with locked access only accessible by relevant study personnel. This study will utilize a commercially available wearable device (i.e. Fitbit Inspire 2) along with the research platform Fitabase to obtain sleep and activity data for 2 months on the participants. Fitbit will be mailed to participants and they will be asked to wear device as often as they can during the observation period. The participants will be able to control the Fibit.com user account (uses their own email/password) associated with the Fitbit device. They will be asked to authorize the Fitabase system via an email to access their Fitbit data and make it available for download for analysis. As appreciation for their participation, participants may keep the Fitbit device for personal use after the study period. Data will be collected via Fitabase research platform which is secure (https://www.fitabase.com/resources/knowledge‐base/working‐with‐the‐irb/). Data will be examined for objective sleep and activity parameters. Weekly compliance questionnaires will be sent to the HHY intervention group starting week 3, to assess compliance with practices. Visit 2 at 6 weeks: Data collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, resting blood pressure and heart rate, hand grip testing, and 6‐minute walk test distance and parameters. Questionnaires will be completed (MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication adherence Report Scale [MARS‐5],). Visit 3 at 8 weeks: Post CR testing will be performed within 1 week following the final CR session. Visit 3 data collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, 6‐minute walk test distance and parameters, resting blood pressure and heart rate and hand grip testing. Questionnaires will be completed (MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication adherence Report Scale [MARS‐5]). Visit 4 at 12 weeks: Visit 4 data collection will include height, weight, waist and hip circumference, temperature, 6‐minute walk test distance and parameters, overnight fasting blood draw (cardio‐metabolic markers), resting blood pressure and heart rate and hand grip testing. Questionnaires will be completed (MacNew Heart Disease questionnaire, Medication adherence Report Scale [MARS‐5]). Other Follow‐up If subjects are not able to complete the questionnaires at the visit, we can send them postage paid return envelope, follow‐up by e‐mail or be telephone in attempt to receive missing data. Subjects may be contacted by telephone to remind them of their follow‐up appointments, or to troubleshoot the devices, or to remind them to follow the HHY program. Remuneration Subjects will not receive any remuneration for participation in the study.

N2  -  BACKGROUND: Excess weight is a major risk factor for chronic diseases. In Australia, over 60% of adults are overweight or obese. The overconsumption of energy‐dense nutrient‐poor (EDNP) foods and low physical activity (PA) levels are key factors contributing to population obesity. New cost‐effective approaches to improve population diet and PA behaviors are needed. OBJECTIVE: This 1‐year randomized controlled trial (6‐month intervention and 6‐month follow‐up) aims to investigate whether a tailored intervention using mobile technology can improve diet and PA behaviors leading to weight loss in adults (aged 18‐65 years) who are overweight or obese and recruited through a social marketing campaign (LiveLighter). METHODS: All eligible participants will provide data on demographics and lifestyle behaviors online at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Using two‐stage randomization, participants will be allocated into one of three conditions (n=200 per group): tailored feedback delivered via email at seven time points, informed by objective dietary (mobile food record app) and activity (wearable activity monitor) assessment; active control receiving no tailored feedback, but undergoing the same objective assessments as tailored feedback; and online control receiving no tailored feedback or objective assessments. Primary outcome measures at 6 and 12 months are changes in body mass, EDNP food and beverage consumption, and daily moderate‐to‐vigorous PA (measured via accelerometry). Secondary outcomes include change in fruit and vegetable consumption, daily sedentary behaviors, and cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Enrolment commenced in August 2017. Primary outcomes at 12 months will be available for analysis from September 2019. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored email feedback provided to individuals may deliver a cost‐effective strategy to overcome existing barriers to improving diet and PA. If found to be successful and cost effective, upscaling this intervention for inclusion in larger‐scale interventions is highly feasible.

N2  -  There are few studies on kinematic, kinematic, and energy consumption after robot training, so it is urgent to study this part. In a small retrospective open‐label study, the results of spatiotemporal parameters and kinetic and kinematic analyzes of patients with chronic stroke in patients who underwent gait using an end‐effector robot were compared with those of Gait speed, Cadence , Stride time, and stride speed, improvement of hip extension in kinematic analysis as a whole, and reduction of anterior tilting in pelvis. This suggests that robot‐assisted gait training may improve the kinematic index Randomized Controlled Trial design is a systematic study. In addition, it is important to evaluate the energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory load of robot‐assisted walking therapy for the rehabilitation of patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke patients with impaired cardiopulmonary function. The purpose of gait therapy in stroke patients is to improve the efficiency of energy consumption by calibrating patterns of gait and asymmetry of gait movements. This is also an important issue for gait researchers. The authors reported that when using an end‐effector type robot, the oxygen consumption was statistically significantly lower during the robot‐assisted walking compared to when the robot was not assisted by the robot. During the walking with the exoskeleton type robot, and when compared to OTW (Overground treadmill walking) during ATW, there was a statistically significant decrease in mean oxygen consumption There was a report. However, previous researches did not compare the pre ‐ treatment and post ‐ treatment, but there is no report on the possibility of improvement of oxygen consumption after robot ‐ assisted gait training. In this study, we divided the patients into two groups. One group was treated with 6‐week gait training using an end‐effector type robot‐assisted walking device and the other group was treated with gait therapy for the same period of time. Six weeks after the end of the treatment, three‐dimensional motion analysis, foot pressure analysis and energy consumption analysis were performed to obtain robot assisted training in terms of space time index, kinematics, kinematic index, dynamic EMG activation pattern, The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the improvement in walking performance and the energy consumption efficiency of walkers are more effective than the conventional walking training group. the three most natural walking cycles Calculate kinematical index and spatio‐temporal index according to each gait cycle Dynamic EMG analysis Dynamic EMG was performed by attaching surface EMG to the skin using Medial GCM, Tibialis Anterior, Vastus Medialis, Rectus Femoris, Medial Hamstring, and Gluteus Maximus of both lower limbs using a wireless Delsys Trigno Sensor System (Delsys Inc, USA) Measure the signal and convert it to Root mean square (RMS). (Figure 5) EMG signal sampling rate: 2000 samples / sec Filter: EMG signal bandwidth 20‐ 450 Hz Surface electrode: Parallel bar electrode The measured EMG signals are obtained by measuring the duration and the period of activity according to the walking cycle and analyzing the degree of activation. 1.

Comparison being made by administering the therapies in random order is to assess the ability of non‐invasive sensors to detect and reliably track cardiovascular physiological changes in response to the administered therapy. The focus of this study is to assess the ability of these devices to detect more subtle changes in congestion and haemodynamics that might be used to guide therapy and thus aid our ability to improve cardiovascular health maintenance rather than just detect and manage crises. In the heart failure group (16 patients), we will investigate the ability of non‐invasive sensors to detect changes in congestion and haemodynamics in response to changes in two vasodilators that are recommended in therapeutic guidelines for the management of heart failure, although not used routinely. Patients in this group will be studied on four occasions at least 72 hours apart. Each study day lasts up to about eight hours. Patients will be asked to avoid large changes in daily diet in the three days before each study period. As part of the consent process, patients will be introduced to the sensors and manoeuvres required in the study. On study days patients will be asked to take their usual morning heart failure medications apart from loop diuretics. Patients will be asked to bring their diuretic with them to be given immediately after being weighed. They will then have a 60 minute investigation period involving the assessment of haemodynamic variables using novel, wearable, non‐invasive monitoring devices, many of which are already commercially available and CE marked. These include de CONDITION: Chronic heart failure ; Circulatory System ; Heart failure PRIMARY OUTCOME: No single primary outcome. This is a pilot study to investigate the ability of novel noninvasive sensors to detect and track the acute haemodynamic effects of medication (hydralazine and/or hydralazine or combination) and a series of physiological manoueuvres. SECONDARY OUTCOME: No secondary outcome measures INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Male and female, 18 y.o. plus, legally able to provide written informed consent 2. Clinical diagnosis of Heart Failure 3. Objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction 3.1. NTproBNP >200ng/L and at least one of the following: 3.2. Left ventricular ejection fraction (=45%) 3.3. Left atrial dimension >40mm 4. Treated with at least 40mg/day of furosemide or 1mg/day of bumetanide 5. Receiving other guideline indicated therapy for heart failure 6. Patients should be in sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation may reduce accuracy of some signals

N2  -  Purpose/Objective(s): Unplanned hospitalizations during cancer treatment can impact cancer outcomes, quality of life, and healthcare costs. Prior studies have suggested that early prediction may facilitate interventional strategies to reduce hospitalization rates. Consumer wearable devices and patient‐generated health data (PGHD) have created much enthusiasm, but their clinical utility remains unclear. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate machine learning (ML) approaches to daily step counts before and during chemoradiation (CRT). Materials/Methods: Patients enrolled in three prospective, single‐institution trials of activity monitoring during chemoradiation (NCT02649569, NCT03102229, NCT03115398) were included in this retrospective ML model development study. Study patients were asked to wear commercial fitness trackers continuously before and during curative‐intent CRT for multiple cancer types. Patient (age, ECOG performance status, sex, and diagnosis), radiotherapy plan metrics (mean esophagus, heart, and lung dose), and step count data were integrated. Patients with missing demographics or a hospitalization within a week prior to CRT were excluded. Step counts were smoothed as a 3‐day running average and normalized. Weekly features were developed, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, range, and standard deviation, and the absolute and relative differences in weekly features between two given weeks were determined. An elastic net‐regularized logistic regression (EN) was trained in a training cohort, with and without step count‐derived features, to predict a first hospitalization event within one week based on data from the preceding two weeks. The models were then evaluated on a separate, hold‐out test population in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: 214 patients, median age 61 (IQR 53‐68), were included in this study. The most common diagnoses were head and neck cancer (30%) and lung cancer (29%). 151 patients (70%) were in the training cohort, and 63 (30%) were in the validation cohort. EN with step count features had strong predictive performance (AUC = 0.81 [0.62‐0.91]) and significantly outperformed EN without step counts (AUC = 0.57 [0.40‐0.74], p = 0.004). Top five contributing variables were step counts from each of the past two days, absolute difference in minimum step counts over the past two weeks, relative decrease in the maximum step count over the past two weeks, and relative decrease in the step count range over the past two weeks. Conclusion: PGHD has the potential to improve predictive ML modeling and direct clinical care. The results highlight the ability to predict hospitalization events based on daily step counts. This model is planned for clinical validation in NRGF‐001, which will randomize patients undergoing CRT for lung cancer to treatment with or without daily step count monitoring.

N2  -  Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) systematic screening studies have not shown a clear usefulness in stroke prevention, as AF might present as paroxysmal and asymptomatic. This study aims to determine the usefulness of some blood‐biomarkers to identify paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in the context of a screening programme. Methods: A total of 100 subjects aged 65–75 years with hypertension and diabetes were randomly selected. AF was assessed by conventional electrocardiogram (ECG) and 4 weeks monitoring with a wearable Holter device (Nuubo™). N‐terminal pro B‐type natriuretic peptide (NT‐proBNP), apolipoprotein CIII (ApoC‐III), von Willebrand factor (vWF), ADAMTS13, urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (uPAR), and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) were determined in serum/plasma samples and the levels were compared depending on AF presence and mode of detection. Results: The AF prevalence in the studied population was found to be 20%. In seven subjects, AF was only detected after 1 month of Holter monitoring (hAF group). NT‐proBNP levels were higher in subjects with AF compared with subjects with no AF (p < 0.0001), even when only taking into account the hAF group (p = 0.031). No significant differences were found in the other biomarkers. The NT‐proBNP >95 pg/ml cut‐off showed high sensitivity and specificity to detect AF (95%, 66.2%) or hAF (85.72%, 66.2%) and was found to be an independent predictor of AF and hAF in a logistic regression analysis. NT‐proBNP correlated with AF burden (r = 0.597, p = 0.024). Conclusion: NT‐proBNP was elevated in AF cases not identified by ECG; thus, it may be used as a screening biomarker in asymptomatic high‐risk populations, with a promising cut‐off point of 95 pg/ml that requires further validation.

KW  -  Cognitive Dysfunction
N2  -  Background / Rationale The participation in sedentary behaviors is high among the older population and increases with age co‐morbidities and cognitive decline. 60% of older adults world‐wide reported sitting for more than four hours per day and when device‐measured, 67% of the older population were sedentary for more than 8.5 hours in their waking day (Harvey et al., 2015). Further, recent policies of confinement and restriction stipulated by various governments in response to the global COVID‐19 pandemic is likely to encourage greater participation in sedentary behavior (Ricci et al., 2020). There is evidence of deleterious health implications of sedentary behaviors, with possible independent associations with all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cardiovascular disease incidence, cancer mortality, and type 2 diabetes incidence(Biswas and Alter, 2015). However, the associations between sedentary behaviors and cognitive health are less clear and inconclusive. A recent systematic review of 18 studies found inconclusive evidence on the overall and independent associations between sedentary behaviors and cognitive function in older adults (Olanrewaju et al., 2020). The review highlighted the lack of quality and intervention studies of effect as one of the limitations of existing evidence. There is some evidence that non‐exercise and physical activity interventions could be effective in reducing sedentary behaviors in older adults. A review of strategies to reduce sedentary behavioural among adults found that the most promising interventions used behavioural change techniques such as self‐monitoring and problem solving(Gardner et al., 2016). A recent meta‐analysis of digital behavior change interventions (DBCI) in older adults suggested that using platforms such as mobile applications, websites, wearable devices reduced sedentary time by 58 minutes per day (SMD = −0.45; 95%CI −0.69, −0.19; p < 0.001) (Stockwell et al., 2019). A separate systematic review of interventions to reduce sedentary behavior in non‐working older adults found that interventions which incorporated goal setting, individualized feedback, motivational sessions reduced objectively measured sitting time by 3.2%‐5.3% of waking time or up to 54 minutes per day (Aunger et al., 2018). Aim To test the feasibility, acceptability and costs of delivering a virtual health coaching intervention via the internet in community dwelling older people. This present proposal aims to pave the way for a future randomized controlled trial by resolving key uncertainties in its planning. The purpose of the future trial will be to test whether WALC‐R intervention compared with providing information about physical activity can improve cognitive function in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment. Objectives 1. To determine the acceptability of intervention to participants 2. To determine feasibility of study with respect to the following: 1. Number of eligible patients 2. Recruitment and retention rates 3. Adherence / compliance rates 4. Collection of potential outcome measures for future trial (completion rates and time) 3. To determine the costs associated with delivering intervention 4. To determine rate of adverse events in both groups. Methods‐ Randomized Feasibility Study The WALC intervention (Walk; Address sensations; Learn; Cue) was originally designed to motivate community‐dwelling older adults to increase physical activity and is based on Social Cognitive theory (Resnick, 2001). The WALC intervention is not a walking/physical activity group, rather, a forum where the concept of sedentary behavior and strategies to reduce these behaviours are coached. The WALC intervention has been validated in several studies for use in the older population and people living with schizophrenia and more recently with serious mental illness (Beebe and Smith, 2010; Resnick et al., 2007; Williams et al., 2019). This study proposes to adopt the WALC intervention, which incorporates elements of the COM‐B behavioral change model to address capability, opportunity, and motivational barriers to reduce sedentary behavior (Michie et al., 2011). Unlike original and previous versions of the WALC intervention, we propose to deliver our intervention (WALC‐R) remotely via the internet. The WALC‐R will consist of a group initial education session, fortnightly health coaching sessions, and self‐monitoring of daily activity levels using pedometer and diary. There is no evidence on the effectiveness of non‐exercise, sedentary behavior‐reducing intervention on cognitive function in the older population. Therefore, we propose to test the feasibility of a remotely delivered health coaching intervention in older adults at risk of cognitive decline with a view to test for effectiveness on cognitive function in a later study. Study design This will be a 13 week unblinded, single‐centre randomized feasibility study. The intervention is comprised of an initial group education session, fortnightly coaching sessions and the provision of a pedometer and diary to enable participants monitor their daily physical activity. Participants in the control group will receive information leaflets which outlines the benefit of being physically active. The design will adhere to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement (CONSORT). Setting and Participants The study will be conducted remotely in the community settings of service users from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT). Prior to starting permissions will be sought from local Research Ethics Committees (REC), CPFT Research and Development team and the National Research Authority. Sampling Strategy Eligible patients who attend the memory clinics and / or receive support from the older people mental health and healthy ageing services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust will be invited to participate. Proposed sample size and Justification Total sample sizes between 24 and 50 have been recommended for feasibility studies. (18‐20). Based on these recommendations, the study proposes to enroll 40 participants, a target sample of 24 (12 per group) after factoring a 40% drop‐out rate. Continuing support and coaching (online) Participants will meet briefly (20‐30 minutes) via the internet with an assigned worker (i.e., their coach) every 2 weeks. The participant and coach will review the participant's walking calendar and address any barriers to and facilitators of engaging in physical activity and reducing sedentary behaviour. Recruitment / Screening Potential participants would be primarily sought from the community mental health, living well, memory services and general practitioners in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. A member of the clinical team will screen for potential participants for initial eligibility (from medical notes, clinic records and/or clinical consultations) and, if appropriate, given information about the trial. The clinician will then arrange an appointment to discuss the trial, along with the opportunity to ask any questions. The researcher will give people 24 hours to decide if they would like to participate. If they are happy with the information they receive, they will be contacted by a member of the research team to give informed consent. This study proposes to recruit patients with mild cognitive impairment. Therefore a mental capacity test will be conducted during the process of consent to ensure that participants understand, retain and weigh up the information available to make a decision about consenting. Participants' general practitioners will be informed about their enrolment onto the study. Once enrolled, participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days. Each participant will be reimbursed £10 for wearing the accelerometer. After completion of the baseline measures, the participants will be informed of their allocation status. Randomization, Post‐randomization withdrawals and exclusions This study proposes a simple randomization of participants into intervention and control arms. Randomization process will be overseen by the researcher using freely available software from Sealed Envelope: https://www.sealedenvelope.com/help/simple‐randomiser/students/. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either 'WALC‐R' (intervention group) or information on recommended physical activity for older adults (control group). Approximately 5 participants will be randomized each month over 8 months. Subjects may discontinue participation in the trial intervention and/or the trial at any time. Unless a subject explicitly withdraws their consent, they will be followed‐up wherever possible and data collected as per the protocol until the end of the trial. Documentation will be completed on withdrawal to confirm the date and reason for withdrawal. Control condition Participants in the control group will complete baseline measures, and then they will receive written information on the benefits of increasing activity levels. This advice will be given in accordance with NHS guide on physical health. Follow‐up assessment The follow‐up assessment will be undertaken at the end of the intervention after 13 weeks. At follow‐up, all measures will be repeated (apart from sociodemographic information). Each participant will receive a £10 voucher for wearing an accelerometer. These assessments will be done by a research worker who is blind to allocation status. Summary of Intervention Initial group education session (online) Participants assigned to the WALC‐R intervention will attend a virtual baseline educational group session which will include a maximum of five people. The aim of the sessions will be to introduce the basics of the benefits of walking for exercise and why exercise is beneficial, as well as to give information, support and motivation to help participants to independently walk more in their daily routines. In the group sessions, we will also introduce the concept of sedentary behaviour and the harms and strategies to sit less and move more, including disrupting prolonged periods of sitting. At the educational session, researchers will have information on the participants' habitual levels of physical activity obtained from baseline data collection. The group session will also include goal setting, in which participants will be encouraged to set their own daily walking targets to increase their habitual levels of walking. All participants will be given a pedometer to self‐monitor how far they walk and a diary to record activity context throughout the intervention daily.

N2  -  Background: It is of significant importance to detect early signs indicating the transition from normal cognitive aging to MCI. Although biomarkers have been extensively examined as early indicators of the pathological process for AD, assessing these biomarkers is expensive and challenging. Behavioral activity markers offer an alternative tool for detection of those in transition. We hypothesized that MCI subjects talk more than agegender‐ matched normal peers in freely‐enacted conversations, possibly due to their impaired ability in identifying social cues required for smooth interactions or in self‐monitoring, organizing and conveying thoughts. This hypothesis was examined in a sub‐study within a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) that assessed whether daily 30 minute faceto‐ face semi‐structured conversations with trained interviewers via webcam and Internet‐enabled personal computers improves cognitive function among those with either normal cognition or MCI (ClinicalTirals.gov: NCT01571427). Methods: Proportions of total words spoken by participants (vs. by interviewers) during recorded conversational sessions in the RCTwere compared between those with MCI and normal cognition (project A). Recorded conversations were transcribed by a single transcriber. As an exploratory study (project B), average total talk time per day spoken by each participant in daily life collected through a small wearable digital recording device was also examined by state‐of‐the‐art speech detection algorithms. 41 subjects in the conversational experimental group with valid recorded sessions (project A) and 45 subjects who consented to record their daily conversation (project B) were used in this study. Interviewers were blind to cognitive status of the subject. Results: The mean (SD) % of words spoken by participants was higher (p<0.01) among MCI (69.5% (9.7)) than normal (60.3% (11.4)) subjects in linear regression models adjusting for age and gender. MCI participants spoke longer (p=0.037) by 105 minutes on average per day during daily life than normal subjects in GEE models controlling for age, education, gender and living arrangement. Conclusions: MCI subjects may exhibit subtle language processing deficits that affect social cognitive abilities required for smooth social interactions, leading to more words spoken during conversations or longer daily talking time. The assessment approach used here may provide an ecologically valid behavioral marker sensitive to transitions to MCI.

KW  -  Diabetes Mellitus
N2  -  Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a growing public health problem highly amenable to prevention and health promotion interventions. Over 26 million people are diagnosed with diabetes, and an estimated 79 million people have pre‐diabetes (1). Physical inactivity, poor eating habits, obesity and smoking are common risk factors for multiple chronic diseases, including DM, and are associated with premature deaths in the United States (2). Traditional interventions for diabetes emphasize education and typically do not address patient‐generated health data (3). Motivational interviewing (MI) is a counseling tool to improve self‐efficacy and support behavioral changes that has been used successfully in treatment of addictions and chronic conditions including diabetes (4‐6). MI focuses on enhancing goal‐setting skills by encouraging focus on manageable steps to improve overall health, establishing reasonable goals, and managing barriers and obstacles to goal attainment. Mobile health (mHealth) technology can be used to allow bi‐directional, timely communication of data and tailored feedback between the patient and health care team; thus mHealth has the potential to change an individual' health behavior and prevent factors that lead to disease (7). This proposal tests the effectiveness of nurse coaches and the mHealth platform as resources to patients. Specifically, the investigators will test a mobile technology‐enabled nurse coaching intervention as a means to engage and empower patients to set their own personal goals to address lifestyle and behavioral changes to better manage their diabetes and comorbidities. The addition of a wireless sensing wearable device to monitor participant activities (physical activity, energy expenditure and sleep quality) will allow the investigators to perform meaningful analysis of patient‐generated health data and provide tailored feedback to motivate the patient to reach personal goals. The investigators will achieve this project through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the P2E2T2 program on diabetes management as measured by the following outcomes: 1) quality of life (QOL); 2) self‐efficacy; 3) readiness to change; and 4) clinically relevant outcomes. This study is a randomized, controlled trial with two groups: 1) Usual care (Care Coordination); and 2) the Patient and Provider Engagement and Empowerment Through Technology (P2E2T2) program ‐ nurse coaching paired with mobile sensor technology to provide targeted feedback of patient‐generated, real‐world community physical activity and sleep quality data to the nurse coach, participants, and primary care providers to improve self‐management of diabetes. Participants will be recruited from the UC Davis Primary Care Clinics network. After enrollment in the study, those randomized to receive the intervention will interact with their nurse coach through mobile technologies by telephone, or by text/e‐mail through the secure mHealth dashboard platform established for communication and transfer of data. The investigators expect to enroll at least 150 patients in each of the intervention and control arms. This sample size will be sufficient to detect differences between the two groups. Even under the conservative assumption that design effects and dropout rates may result in a reduced sample size of 100 per treatment group, the study will still have at least 80% power to detect the specified clinically important effect size. Based on a previous study of nurse coaching using MI to improve disease self‐management (8), the investigators found improvement in self‐efficacy scores significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group. Data will be collected from participants at three time points: 1) baseline data at time of recruitment; 2) 3 months (coinciding with the completion of the intervention); and 3) 9 months (selected to assess sustained effects of the intervention (6 months after intervention ended)). At baseline, in addition to outcomes, all participants will complete a demographic survey which will include age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, income level and insurance type and health history using the Charlson Comorbidity Index which includes common chronic conditions. All data for the study will be collected by the research coordinator and entered into the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system housed in the servers managed by UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) (9).

The addition of a wireless sensing wearable device to monitor participant activities (physical activity, energy expenditure and sleep quality) will allow the investigators to perform meaningful analysis of patient‐generated health data and provide tailored feedback to motivate the patient to reach personal goals. The investigators will achieve this project through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of the P2E2T2 program on diabetes management as measured by the following outcomes: 1) quality of life (QOL); 2) self‐efficacy; 3) readiness to change; and 4) clinically relevant outcomes. Specific Aim 2: Compare specific health and fitness outcomes of individuals participating in each study arm. This study is a randomized, controlled trial with two groups: 1) Usual care (Care Coordination); and 2) the Patient and Provider Engagement and Empowerment Through Technology (P2E2T2) program ‐ nurse coaching paired with mobile sensor technology to provide targeted feedback of patient‐generated, real‐world community physical activity and sleep quality data to the nurse coach, participants, and primary care providers to improve self‐management of diabetes. Participants will be recruited from the UC Davis Primary Care Clinics network. After enrollment in the study, those randomized to receive the intervention will interact with their nurse coach through mobile technologies by telephone, face‐to‐face videoconference, or by text/e‐mail through the secure mHealth dashboard platform established for communication and transfer of data. The investigators expect to enroll at least 150 patients in each of the intervention and control arms. This sample size will be sufficient to detect differences between the two groups. Even under the conservative assumption that design effects and dropout rates may result in a reduced sample size of 100 per treatment group, the study will still have at least 80% power to detect the specified clinically important effect size. Based on a previous study of nurse coaching using MI to improve disease self‐management (8), the investigators found improvement in self‐efficacy scores significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the control group. Data will be collected from participants at three time points: 1) baseline data at time of recruitment; 2) 3 months (coinciding with the program completion); and 3) 9 months (selected to assess sustained effects of the intervention). At baseline, in addition to outcomes, all participants will complete a demographic survey which will include age, gender, race/ethnicity, education level, income level and insurance type and health history using the Charlson Comorbidity Index which includes common chronic conditions. All data for the study will be collected by the research coordinator and entered into the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) system housed in the servers managed by UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) (9).

N2  -  Introduction: Few late‐stage clinical trials in Parkinson's disease (PD) have produced evidence on the clinical validity of sensor‐based digital measurements of daily life activities to detect responses to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess whether digital measures from patients with mild‐to‐moderate Lewy Body Dementia demonstrate treatment effects during a randomized Phase 2 trial. Methods: Substudy within a 12‐week trial of mevidalen (placebo vs 10, 30, or 75 mg), where 70/344 patients (comparable to the overall population) wore a wrist‐worn multi‐sensor device. Results: Treatment effects were statistically significant by conventional clinical assessments (Movement Disorder Society‐Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS‐UPDRS] sum of Parts I‐III and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study‐Clinical Global Impression of Change [ADCS‐CGIC] scores) in the full study cohort at Week 12, but not in the substudy. However, digital measurements detected significant effects in the substudy cohort at week 6, persisting to week 12. Conclusions: Digital measurements detected treatment effects in a smaller cohort over a shorter period than conventional clinical assessments. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03305809

N2  -  Primary Outcome The Primary Objective of the proposed pilot will be the improved Health‐Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) for patients participating in the full intervention and limited intervention groups compared to patients in the control group. It is hypothesized that the improvement will he higher for the full intervention group patients compared to the limited intervention group patients. Secondary Objectives The secondary outcomes are measured as follows: 1. Secondary Objective for patients: includes improved parameters of patients participating in the full and limited intervention groups associated with the improvement in disease self‐management; symptom burden; motivation; mobility; sleep hygiene; depression and anxiety. 2. Secondary Objective for caregivers: includes improved parameters of caregivers participating in the full and limited intervention groups associated with caregiver burden; depression and anxiety. 3. Secondary Objective for healthcare professionals: includes improved parameters of healthcare professionals before and after introducing technology associated with anxiety and technology acceptance. 4. Secondary Objective for technology evaluation: includes the feasibility, usability and acceptability of the technology used by patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals. Materials Hardware ‐ Activity Tracker ‐ Garmin Venu Sq. 37mm is a wearable watch suitable for Health Monitoring (i.e. wrist‐based heart rate, daily resting heart rate, abnormal heart rate alerts, all‐day stress, relaxation reminders, relaxation breathing timer, sleep) ‐ Tablet ‐ LENOVO Tab M10 10.1'' 64GB ‐ Tablet ‐ LENOVO Tab M10 4G LTE 10.1'' 32GB ‐ Mobile XIAOMI Redmi 9C Questionnaires There will be three evaluation periods (baseline, intermediate and final) during the two‐year pilot and the evaluation tools used are the following: Self‐report at home (PASYKAF) or at inpatient and outpatient clinic (AMEN) through GATEKEEPER using tablets Patients: For PASYKAF ‐ Socio‐demographics information including age, gender, educational level, marital status, type of diagnosis etc. ‐ EORTC QLQ C‐30 (1) is a cancer health‐related quality‐of‐life questionnaire that has been widely validated and used in clinical trials and investigations using PROs for individual patient management. It is composed of both multi‐item scales and single‐item measures. The QLQ‐C30 will be administered at admission and at 6 weeks. ‐ IPOS (2) is a measure of global symptom burden which includes items that measure physical, psychosocial, social and spiritual domains in line with an impeccable holistic assessment. It allows patients to list their main concerns, to add other symptoms they are experiencing, and to state whether they have unmet information or practical needs. It can assess and monitor symptoms and concerns in advanced illness, determine the impact of healthcare interventions, and demonstrate quality of care. The IPOS will be administered at admission and at 6 weeks. ‐ HADS (3) is a self‐report scale developed to assess psychological distress in non‐psychiatric patients in both hospital and community settings. It consists of two subscales, measuring symptoms of depression (HADS‐D), and anxiety (HADS‐A). Following completion of the HADS, a pop‐up section will follow that allows use cases to provide any additional information that they may feel is important regarding their psychological well‐being ‐ qualitative data/ free word to describe their personal lived experience (completion is optional). HADS will be administered at admission and at 6 weeks. ‐ System Usability Scale (SUS) (4) (simplified version) will assess the usability of the platform and the devices on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). SUS will be administered at 6 weeks. ‐ The Single Ease Question (SEQ) will assess the level of difficulty for each interaction on a 7‐point Likert scale (1 = very difficult and 7 = very easy). SEQ will be administered at 6 weeks. For AMEN ‐ EQ‐5D (5) is a standardised measure of health status to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economical appraisal. The EQ‐5D provides a simple descriptive profile and a single summary index value for health status. The EQ‐5D will be administered at admission and at 6 weeks. ‐ MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment Greek Version) assess the cognitive decline of the person based on tasks related to attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The MOCA will be administered at admission and at 6 weeks. ‐ Mini‐Mental State Exam (MMSE) is a widely used test of cognitive function among the elderly; it includes tests of orientation, attention, memory, language and visual‐spatial skills. The MMSE will be administered at admission and at 6 weeks. ‐ Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (6) will be used to measure depression and is often used to assess depression in the elderly patients. The app will utilize simple, easy to respond, and user‐friendly statements or questions that can be answered by the patient or/and the main caregiver. ‐ Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) (7) will be used to measure anxiety and is often used to assess depression in the elderly patients. The app will utilize simple, easy to respond, and user‐friendly statements or questions that can be answered by the patient or/and the main caregiver. ‐ System Usability Scale (SUS). A simplified version of the SUS will assess the usability of the platform and the devices on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). SUS will be administered at 6 weeks. ‐ The Single Ease Question (SEQ). SEQ will assess the level of difficulty for each interaction on a 7‐point Likert scale (1 = very difficult and 7 = very easy). SEQ will be administered at 6 weeks. Caregivers: For AMEN and PASYKAF ‐ Zarit Burden Interview (8) is a self‐report questionnaire assesses caregiver perceptions of burden that may inadvertently affect their health, personal, social or financial wellbeing. ‐ System Usability Scale (SUS) will assess the usability of the platform and the devices on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). ‐ The Single Ease Question (SEQ) will assess the level of difficulty for each interaction on a 7‐point Likert scale (1 = very difficult and 7 = very easy). ‐ Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (9) is a standardized measure to assess symptoms of depression in the general population. ‐ State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (10) is a standardized measure to assess anxiety in the general population. Healthcare Professionals: For AMEN and PASYKAF ‐ A modified version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (11,12) tool will be used to assess whether healthcare professionals accept the use of GATEKEEPER and other technologies during the study. ‐ System Usability Scale (SUS) will assess the usability of the platform and the devices on a 5‐point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree). ‐ The Single Ease Question (SEQ) will assess the level of difficulty for each interaction on a 7‐point Likert scale (1 = very difficult and 7 = very easy). Research Design This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with between and within subject design Randomization Stratified random sampling creating subgroups based on gender, age range, and stage of illness (for both organizations). We will use the ECOG scale (13) to assess cancer patients' stage. We will use a randomization at the patient 1:1 level. Nurse assistants, social workers, physiotherapists and psychologists cannot be employed in both sites at a time and patients are unlikely to move from a control to an intervention facility, due to the geographical spread of facilities and the fact that they treat different conditions (cancer at PASYKAF and dementia at AMEN). We will also audit the recruitment rates across arms to investigate the extent of any differential recruitment and if any bias might accrue. The sites will be visited by the Field Coordinator and other research staff to present the project and its needs; a consultant statistician will then produce the random allocation of patients for either the intervention or the control arm of the study. Blinding procedures The Research Assistants, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and psychologists responsible for data collection will not have access to the information of which group (control or intervention) the participant is. Study Population The users involved in the pilot are cancer patients (+50) and dementia patients (+65) that face comorbidities, professional caregivers or relatives that have the role of the informal caregivers and health care professionals of the participating organizations. In more detail: i. Patients with mild, moderate, and severe dementia aged 60+ and high complexity level cancer patients, aged 50+, will participate in the study. People with dementia will be recruited by the "Archangelos Michael" nursing home (AMEN) and people with cancer will be recruited by the Cyprus Association of Cancer Patients and Friends (PASYKAF). ii. Healthcare professionals from both organisations will participate in the study. This includes professions of psychologists, social workers, speech therapists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, gymnasts and art therapists (e.g., music therapists, paint therapist, theatre therapist). iii. Two hundred and fifty cancer patients' caregivers (n=250) and one hundred and forty‐five dementia patients' caregivers (n= 145) will also participate in the study. Procedure The intervention will be delivered at a community level as following: The patients of both organisations will be screened to fulfil the inclusion criteria (i.e., face difficulties with co‐morbidities). Then, participants (also including informal caregivers) in the intervention group will be provided with a health‐promotion application based on software and hardware (commercial devices) solutions for supporting and managing users. The Control Group will receive current standard of care for any of their ongoing health conditions. In addition to this, and following randomization, their symptomatology and quality of life will also be assessed, at least three times (in the participant's baseline assessment, and follow‐ups). In each of these encounters, there are established procedures to implement appropriate action if further mental health support is needed. Sample Size Calculation This is a pilot RCT (14) so according to standard procedures a formal power calculation is not required and sample was determined by the research team based on experience. However, we have performed sample power calculation for patients participating in the trial as followed: We estimated that with 251 patients, the study would have 80% power to detect a significant between‐group difference in the change in the HRQOL score from baseline to 6 weeks, with a medium effect size of 0.5 SD. We allowed for the enrollment of an additional 20% of participants in order to compensate for the loss of any patients to follow‐up which provides a targeted sample size of 300 patients. Assignment to study groups The Control group will receive standard health care with no technical support, where the intervention groups will receive platform and device services provided to each user. In that respect, Intervention Group 1 will receive no real‐time feedback, where Intervention Group 2 will unhand with real data and notifications. Control Group ‐ standard healthcare (no technology group) A control group is defined as a group of clinical trial participants who will not be provided any digital devices as part of the trial and will receive care as usual by PASYKAF and AMEN. Intervention Group 1 ‐ platform/devices (no real feedback provided (limited technology group) A limited technology group is defined as a group of clinical trial participants who receive the digital devices but not the automated interventions through the devices (prompts, messages). Intervention Group 2 ‐platform/devices (with real feedback provided) (full technology group) A full technology group is defined as a group of clinical trial participants who receive the digital devices as part of the trial and healthcare professionals receive the patients' data. Asessment Timeline Screening (e.g., ECOG etc.) for eligibility Baseline assessment (all questionnaires will be completed and patients and caregivers in intervention groups will receive the devices). During the intervention (6 weeks) (self‐report and physiological parameters assessment using the wearable devices and the app Follow up at 6 weeks (all questionnaires will be completed and in addition patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals in intervention groups will complete questionnaires related to usability, feasibility and acceptability of technology).

N2  -  RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Women naturally gain weight beyond that of the added pregnancy tissue and many gradually lose this excess weight following delivery. In the US, 15‐27% of women across all ethnic groups have excess postpartum weight retention (PPWR) of > 10lbs one year after delivery. (Lipsky, Strawderman, and Olson 2012, 1496‐1502); (Gunderson et al. 2008, 178‐187); (DeGroot et al. 2021a, e0255248) This issue has also been documented in AD women across multiple services with 12‐15% not meeting fitness standards at one year postpartum. (DeGroot et al. 2021b, e0255248) (Rogers et al. 2020, e227‐e234) This is an immediate concern for AD women as it has a detrimental effect on career progression. Weight retention also has long‐term consequences for health including contributing significantly to the risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. It is shown that women who return to their pre‐pregnancy weight by about six months have a lower risk of being overweight 10 years later. (Amorim Adegboye and Linne 2013, CD005627) This critical postpartum time period in a woman's life has major repercussions on her well‐being. A significant number of women are never able to effectively lose weight and achieve fitness postpartum. Long‐term, the added weight and resulting metabolic effects of postpartum weight retention lead to chronic health conditions such as obesity type II diabetes, chronic hypertension and other components of metabolic syndrome. (Linne et al. 2003, 1516‐1522) Many AD women succumb to this cycle of weight retention and are unable to serve effectively in the military. This affects 10‐20% of AD women who become pregnant while serving and was highlighted by retrospective research performed at Tripler Army Medical Center. (DeGroot et al. 2021a, e0255248) Our literature review reveals five factors that contribute significantly to weight changes following delivery in AD women: diet, exercise, breastfeeding, sleep and depression. RESEARCH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: The PADaWL study seeks to determine if dietary interventions by a licensed dietician in the first year postpartum will lead to more effective weight loss and ultimately physical fitness than routine postpartum care among a cohort of AD service members. The primary goal of this research is to determine how effectively AD women lose weight and recover fitness after delivery. Specifically, aims of this study are to: Aim#1: Identify factors that influence the timing of active duty servicewomen return‐to‐duty fitness postpartum. Aim #2: Characterize the utility of a biometric device to monitor multi‐factorial influences on achieving pre‐pregnancy fitness postpartum Aim #3: Determine the effectiveness of intensive dietary counseling in the first year postpartum on weight loss and physical fitness. STUDY PROCEDURES: I. Recruitment will be performed using multiple methods and can be recruited at any time during their pregnancy: Passive recruitment will occur in the TAMC OB/GYN clinic. Posters will be displayed throughout the OB/GYN clinic with tabs showing phone numbers allowing the patients to contact researchers directly to inquire about the study. Active recruitment will occur in the TAMC OB/GYN clinic. Providers will directly ask AD women who are obstetric patients whether they are interested in participating and direct them to the research staff. If necessary, appointments in MHS Genesis will be screened for healthy primiparous AD women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy who would be candidates for the study. II. Screening for Eligibility: Potential participants will be approached and screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria by either one of the researchers or research assistants. This will be done via telephone call. If they are interested in participating in the study, they will be sent a flyer detailing the study via email. If they maintain interest in participating in the study, they will be asked to meet with the research team at the time of their 34‐37week appointment. III. Enrollment: Eligible potential participants will meet a member of the research team either before or after their 34‐37week appointment. They will bring a copy of their pre‐ pregnancy fitness report. During this appointment they will be rescreened. Informed Consent and HIPPA consent will be obtained. Randomization will occur. Subjects will be assigned a de‐identified study subject number. An anonymous myfitnesspal.com account will be opened, and they will be asked to familiarize themselves with the website. Subjects will be asked to obtain a scale for home use. Subject will be given a hand‐ out on all the data which will be collected on her during the course of the study. IV. Data collection at Enrollment: After signing the consent, subjects will be asked to complete questionnaires on fitness and diet during their pregnancy. These questionnaires will be on‐line, and they will enter their data utilizing their anonymous study ID. A demographic, cultural and social questionnaire will be obtained. V. Retrospective Data collected after Enrollment: Weight gain in pregnancy, Conditions complicating pregnancy, EPDS score at 28weeks VI. Delivery: All AD women participants in the PADaWL study coming to TAMC L&D for their delivery after 35 weeks will be identified based on the posted website list, via screening of patients on the postpartum ward, or will contact research personnel via telephone call or text. Lipid profile labs will be drawn at the time of their admission with the remainder of their obstetric labs. Subjects will deliver their newborn and after stabilization will be transferred to the postpartum ward. On postpartum day #1 or #2, the subject will be approached by the research team in the postpartum ward. Subjects will be given the Garmin fitness tracker and given instructions on use. The subject will use their initials and only their birthday year to set up the app. She will be asked to start recording diet and activity levels (primarily measured as steps and caloric expenditure) on the day after being discharged from hospital. She will be given repeat instructions on appropriate monitoring of diet and exercise. Before discharge she will obtain a 6‐week postpartum appointment with one the researchers. Intervention group will obtain their first virtual nutrition counseling appointment to occur within the first month postpartum VII. Randomized groups to active vs routine dietary management: Both groups will receive the following: Nutrition education handouts pertaining to healthy postpartum eating, Nutrition education handouts pertaining to calorie counting procedures to include websites, apps, and methods of estimating caloric intake, General calorie recommendations based on participant age, height, weight, and activity level Intervention group will receive: One‐on‐one appointments with a Registered Dietitian via virtual health within the first month postpartum, three months postpartum, six months postpartum, and 12 months postpartum VIII. First 12 weeks postpartum: Period of intense data collection: All subjects will be collecting daily diet information via myfitnesspal.com. All subjects will be collecting activity as well as sleep levels via the Garmin fitness tracker. This data will be downloaded automatically to the website via their smart phone. All subjects will document her breast feeding weekly in the myfitnesspal.com app. All subjects will obtain weekly weights and place data onto their myfitnesspal.com website. The intervention group will have a virtual nutrition counseling appointment within the first month postpartum and a second appointment in the third month postpartum. At the 6‐ week postpartum appointment with one of the research investigators, subjects will submit a EPDS questionnaire to assess depression. This weekly data will be collected through their 12weeks postpartum. The data will be accessible by the research personnel via the internet. If data is missing, the subject will be contacted by research personnel to improve compliance. IX. 6 months postpartum: Subjects will undergo telephonic interview with research team. The following data will be obtained: Weight, Dietary questionnaire, Fitness questionnaire, Sleep questionnaire, EPDS, Breast feeding data, The intervention group will have a 3rd virtual nutrition counseling in this timeframe. X. 9 months postpartum: The intervention group will undergo a fourth and final virtual nutrition counseling appointment in this timeframe. XI. 12 months postpartum: The patient will undergo her first military fitness evaluation for record at 1 year postpartum including weight and height. She will be asked to bring a copy of these data to her 12month postpartum visit. XII. 12 months postpartum: Subjects will undergo a clinic visit with physical exam with one of the research investigators. In addition, they will submit the following data: Weight, Dietary questionnaire, Fitness questionnaire, Sleep questionnaire, EPDS, Breast feeding data, Post‐study questionnaire. The intervention group will have a final virtual nutrition counseling appointment. STAISTICAL ANALYSIS Aim#1: The outcomes evaluated are 1) the ability of AD women to achieve military weight standards at 12 weeks, 6months and 1 year postpartum, and 2) improvement in mandated physical fitness assessment at 12 months postpartum. Odds ratio and t‐test will be used to compare pre‐pregnancy and postpartum fitness results for the collective enrollment. ANOVA with repeated measures over time will be used to evaluate differences between pre pregnancy, at delivery, and different time points post pregnancy for weight. Regression analysis will be used to determine the linear regression algorithm for weight loss over time for each participant from delivery through up to one year postpartum to determine the x intercept of the time point when weight equals pre pregnancy weight for each participant. This time period of return to pre pregnancy weight can be used along with percent weight loss at 12 weeks post pregnancy as the metrics to examine the relationship with other variables of sleep, breast feeding, activity, etc.Multiple variate stepwise regression analysis will be used to identify which variables most strongly independently influence weight loss (period of time before pre pregnancy weight is achieved, and/or percent weight loss at specific timepoints (1eg. 2 weeks, 6 months, 1 year) from delivery date). Which variables are covariates with other variables will also be determined. Aim #2: The efficacy of the fitness tracker to monitor postpartum women as they regain fitness in the year after pregnancy will be evaluated based on 1) the ability to generate consistent useable data, and 2) the acceptance by the study participants as a wearable device Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize how many events of interrupted data or non‐collected data missing data occurs each week for 12 weeks postpartum Aim #3: Determine the effectiveness of intensive dietary counseling in the first year postpartum on weight loss and physical fitness. To test the effectiveness of dietary intervention the participants will be randomized to two groups. Group 1 (n=32) will receive routine postpartum care. Group 2 (n=32) will receive dietary interventions by a licensed dietician. The metric for efficacy of the intervention will be detecting an effect size of 20% in weight, sleep score, breast feeding score ANOVA will be used to compare the two groups with repeated measures over time at 16 time points over time (pre‐pregnancy, time of delivery, weekly for 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months postpartum) for weight, sleep score, breast feeding score. For fitness and activity ANOVA at two time points (pre‐pregnancy and 12 months postpartum) by group interaction effect will be analyzed.

KW  -  Spinal Cord Injuries
N2  -  Spinal cord injury (SCI) at the cervical level impairs hand function severely compromises performance of activities of daily living. The physical rehabilitation process requires commitment by the participant to achieve meaningful gains in function. Rehabilitation approaches that are cognitively engaging can facilitate greater commitment to practice and improved movement learning. The investigators propose to develop innovative platforms that utilize virtual reality (VR) and instrumented wearables that enhance cognitive factors during motor learning of hand grasp and reach after SCI. These factors include greater sense of agency, or perception of control, and multi‐sensory feedback. Sense of agency is implicated with greater movement control, and various sensory feedback modalities (visual, audio, and haptic) are proven effective in movement training. However, these factors are not well considered in traditional physical therapy approaches. The investigators have developed two novel cognitive‐based platforms for rehabilitating grasp and reach function and propose to test each platform in Veterans with chronic SCI at the cervical level. Aim 1 will investigate how the "cognition" glove may improve functional grasp. This glove includes force and flex sensors that provide inputs to a machine learning algorithm trained to predict when secure grasp is achieved. The glove alerts the user of secure grasp through onboard sensory modules providing visual (LED), audio (beeper), and tactile (vibrator) feedback. During training, feedback is provided at gradually shorter time‐intervals to progressively induce agency based on the neuroscience principle of 'intentional binding'. This principle suggests that with greater agency, one perceives their action (i.e., secure grasp) is more coupled in time to a sensory consequence (i.e., glove feedback). The glove is user‐ready, and now has compatibility with customized VR applications to provide enhanced sensory feedback through engaging and customized visual and sound alerts. The investigators hypothesize that enhanced feedback in VR will produce even greater improvements in grasp performance than onboard feedback alone. Aim 2 will investigate how Veterans with SCI may learn greater arm muscle control during virtual reaching while using a "sensory" brace that provides isometric resistance to one arm to elicit electromyography (EMG) patterns that can drive a virtual arm. The person receives visual feedback from VR and muscle tendon haptic feedback from the brace during training. Tendon stimulation can elicit movement sensations that modulate muscle activation patterns. The VR feedback will provide conscious movement training cues while vibration feedback will subconsciously elicit more distinct EMG patterns based on cluster analysis. The investigators hypothesize that the promotion of distinct EMG patterns, achieved by maximizing inter‐cluster distances, will improve performance of a reach‐to‐touch task. Importantly, the concept of strengthening cognitive agency and learning of movement using wearable technology, multi‐sensory feedback, and virtual reality during physical training will be applicable to all forms of neuromuscular impairment, including stroke and traumatic brain injury in addition to SCI.

N2  -  Approximately 35 % of Americans sleep ≤6h per night, an amount that has been deemed sub‐optimal by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society, the National Sleep Foundation, American Thoracic Society, and the American Heart Association. These consensus statements echo findings from many reviews on this topic. This is alarming, given epidemiologic and experimental research showing that reduced sleep time is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. As such, short sleep represents an unmet public health problem. There are, however, no empirically supported interventions for insufficient sleep. The proposed study addresses this critical gap by evaluating the efficacy of a novel intervention that is theoretically grounded, feasible, and has positive impacts on sleep duration. Previous studies have associated habitual short sleep duration with important adverse cardiometabolic outcomes, including weight gain, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stress, etc. They suggest that those that report short sleep may be more likely to experience functional impairments and are less likely to engage in behaviors consistent with a healthy lifestyle. A proposed mechanism of these relationships is that insufficient sleep duration triggers metabolic disturbances and increased immune response resulting in appetite dysregulation, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and resultant disease states. In addition to cardiometabolic effects, behavioral and functional consequences of short sleep have been well‐documented. For example, short sleepers are more likely to exhibit difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep daytime sleepiness drowsy driving, and other impairments as a result of sleep loss. Laboratory studies have extensively documented neurocognitive and behavioral effects of sleep loss, including increased objective sleepiness, impaired vigilance using computer‐based psychomotor assessments, and deficits in working memory, decision‐making, and executive function, as assessed using standardized neuropsychologic and neuroimaging techniques. Most, if not all, sleep disorders have targeted interventions. Interventions have not been developed or evaluated for insufficient sleep. An effective and disseminable intervention for insufficient sleep will likely differ from those of sleep disorders‐ rather than an in‐clinic, visit‐based, medication/device/procedure‐focused, non‐tailored approach, a successful approach for insufficient sleep will likely be out‐of‐clinic, population/community‐based, lifestyle‐focused, and individually‐tailored. The problem of insufficient sleep is less like other sleep disorders and more like other health behaviors, such as smoking, poor diet, and lack of physical activity, in that the reasons for insufficient sleep involve beliefs and attitudes, home and work demands, and environmental constraints. With this in mind, a behavioral intervention was developed based on concepts originally implemented in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI), the most well‐supported treatment approach for insomnia. Although CBTI does not routinely increase sleep duration, it has sleep efficiency as its primary endpoint and employs concepts that can potentially be used to increase sleep time while maintaining high levels of sleep efficiency. The intervention originally developed included algorithms that recognize the natural "ebb and flow" of sleep ability within an individual seek to use an individual's own sleep data to predict (1) when is an optimal time to make a change to sleep, and (2) what sort of incremental change should be made with the eventual goal of increasing sleep efficiency and duration. Different people may need different amounts of sleep. And some people may not be able to make large changes to their sleep schedule all at once. Many individuals have situational constraints that change over time. The intervention in the proposed study is by design self‐correcting, individually‐tailored, and not dependent on unknown individual sleep needs. It can adapt to any schedule and situation and can adapt to changes in a person's sleep schedule. This sleep extension intervention specifically uses a novel approach, where individualized feedback will be provided to each participant, based on information provided by the wearable devices and the sleep diary. The goal is recognizing the optimal time to make a change to sleep patterns and deciding what kind of change should be made.

KW  -  Stroke
N2  -  Only 25% of stroke patients return to the functional status of everyday participation. Early and continuous rehabilitation facilitates the functional recovery and prognosis of stroke patients. Performance of the appropriate rehabilitation program is now one of the important accreditation criteria for stroke centers. Adherence to post‐acute stroke rehabilitation guideline is associated with improved outcome. Early intervention and continuous practice of rehabilitation training, including functional tasks, is reported to be positively correlated with prolonged recovery of functional improvement after stroke. However, underutilization of rehabilitation after stroke has been reported, because of work overload of therapists and maldistributed centers and therapist workforce, transportation to the overcrowded rehabilitation units in the hospitals or clinics, insufficient funding of community‐based programs and time limitation of caregivers. Several innovative interventions have been introduced beside the conventional rehabilitation because of increasing awareness of the brain's regenerative potential and advances of technology by utilizing visual feedback, transcranial magnetic stimulation and robotics. An alternative way of delivering post‐stroke rehabilitation, telerehabilitation, has been proposed by information and communication technologies. The devices could detect, store and upload their physical activity recorded in the sensor‐embedded mobile devices of smart watches and smartphones, with connection to the internet and get real‐time feedback by the computation. The market penetration of smart mobile devices is rapidly rising in every industrial sector and professional field. The smartphone software applications (apps) are becoming increasingly popular for both health care consumers and providers. The investigators designed a customizable, sensor‐driven, internet‐based rehabilitation system consisting of a sensing watch, smartphone, a web server and database and users' interface for medical staff. The primary aim of the study is to determine if the poststroke rehabilitation motion could be performed and recorded precisely with the smartphones or watches‐based system. The investigators successfully implement the system developed in the project into three hospitals. Researchers recruited totally 100 subjects with acute stroke until 13, Oct, 2017 including 50 in the study and 50 in the control group. There were 60 male (60%) and 40 females (40%) with mean age 57.9±8.7 years. Researchers used the questionnaire of Unified Theory of Acceptance & Use of Technology, UTAUT) to 8 determine the acceptance of the system by the users. There was no difference between the study and control groups. In the 3‐month implementation period, the scores of each sections of UTAUT increased significantly in the study group. The effects of the system were determined by five scales of rehabilitation: modified Rankin scale (MRS), Barthel index (BI), Stream Wolf Motor Function Test (SWMFT), Functional Independence Measure (FIM) and Berg Balance. In all scales, both study and control groups got significant improvement in the 3‐month study period. The significantly improvement of function was also revealed in the subgroup analysis in the study group, including 23 subjects with smartphones and 16 with smart watches. There was no difference between two subgroups. No significant difference was shown in the comparison of the scores of five rehabilitation scales of 30 days and 90 days in the study and control groups. The investigators had focus groups interviews by inviting the stakeholders of the proposed systems and learned from the common and different viewpoints. And investigators proposed business models "hospital‐to‐patients" for implementation of the mobile device‐based rehabilitation outside hospitals. The costs and effectiveness were compared to the traditional in‐person rehabilitation in the hospitals and institutes.

KW  -  Stroke
N2  -  Abstract One of the most frustrating and persistent motor sequelae of stroke is poor arm and hand function. There are many therapies for arm function post‐stroke. The most effective strategies use repetitive, meaningful movement to promote neuroplasticity to support long lasting improvements in arm function. However, at best, the interventions are only moderately effective in improving impairment related outcomes with little or no carry over into everyday, real‐world, activities. There are two gaps in this area, one is for effective interventions and the second is for methods of measuring outcomes that reflect real‐world use of the arm. This study is designed to fill both these gaps with technology. GoHandTM is conceived to be a therapeutic wearable to provide auditory feedback for any voluntary wrist and finger movement. This type of positive auditory feedback is known to stimulate neural connections and, through the process of neural plasticity, imprint the learned movement pattern. The sensor also provides performance feedback that is motivating allowing patients to set and accomplish movement and practice goals and track progress. The global aim of this project is to develop and validate a sensing and feedback device to the detect disassociated wrist and arm movements and provide auditory feedback for hand movement over a range of starting capacities. The focus is on wrist movement because one of the strongest prognostic indicators for recovery of arm function post‐stroke is 20o of active wrist extension and any degree of active finger movement.20 This is a proof‐of‐concept study aimed at contributing evidence towards the need, usability and efficacy potential of the GoHandTM sensor in people with reduced hand function post‐stroke. People with stroke who have arm and hand movement deficits will be invited into a two group, randomized, proof‐of‐concept, trial. The outcome is change over a one‐month period in movement quality as measured by the GoHand sensor. The intervention period is one month. The intervention to be tested is the GoHand sensor, specifically the auditory feedback provided for an optimal wrist and hand movement during everyday tasks. To standardize the practice sessions, all persons will be taught the GRASP (Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program) which has been shown to be of benefit to people recovering from stroke. The intervention group will practice the GRASP program with the sensor in feedback mode and the control group will practice with the sensor without feedback. The total sample size is 12, 6 per group. The study will be used to create movement metric algorithms and provide preliminary data for extent of change and usability.

N2  -  Introduction: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an exercise‐based program prescribed after cardiac events that is associated with improved physical, mental, and social functioning; however, as few as 15‐50% of patients report any exercise 6 months after CR. Physical activity (PA) is critical to avoid recurrence of cardiac events and mortality as well as maintaining functional capacity after completing Phase II CR. Leveraging digital heath strategies to increase adherence to PA is a promising approach. Our aim was to determine whether engagement with the MOVN mobile application (app) and a Fitbit wearable activity tracker would improve step counts over 2 months after CR. The primary objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to establish an effect size for average daily step counts between study arms. Methods: We randomized patients 1:1 to the intervention or control group. The intervention group used the MOVN app (for PA self‐management and to receive messages on motivation and education on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease) and wore a Fitbit Charge 2 to track daily steps. Participants in the usual care group wore a pedometer and recorded their daily steps in a diary. Data from the self‐reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 2 months. We conducted a t‐test and Cohen's d calculation to determine any differences between groups on the primary outcome of average daily step counts and effect size over 2 months, respectively. Results: We recruited 60 patients from 2 CR sites of a community hospital in Northern California. The mean age was 66.8 ± 8.6 and 22% were female; retention rate was 85%. Over 2 months, the intervention group had approximately 2,100 more steps per day than the control group (8,832 ± 3,408 vs. 6,747 ± 3,990; P=0.051 ; Cohen's d=0.54), but this study was not powered to detect significant differences. Conclusions: Our digital health intervention presents a promising, pragmatic approach to promote PA maintenance after CR. Future research is needed to test the efficacy of this intervention as a full‐scale clinical trial. This intervention addresses a major public health initiative to promote PA in patients with CVD with the potential to improve critical PA, clinical, and psychosocial outcomes.

N2  -  The present study is a randomized double‐blind placebo controlled repeated measures design, with sampling of the cohorts on five separate occasions. Group 1: Intervention Group (n = 24) Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive males, supplement, n = 12 Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive females, supplement, n=12 Group 2: Placebo Group (n = 24) Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive males, no supplement, n = 12 Healthy, overweight or obese physically inactive females, no supplement, n=12 Participants will be asked to make 5 visits. Day 0 (Visit 1): Eligible participants that provided informed consent will complete a medical screening questionnaire to determine their readiness to perform exercise. Participants will thus complete the SF‐36 and CSEP Get Active Questionnaire form. Participant characteristics will then be measured. At this time, anthropometric measurements (i.e., height, weight, waist circumference) and a dual energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement will be performed. This must be done in order to verify that the participant meets the inclusion criteria of being overweight. Following this screening, participants will begin the following the study timeline.Upon completion, participants will be randomized into one of two groups. Day 1 (Visit 2): Participants will arrive following an overnight fast (including no caffeine for 12 hours) and having abstained from any exercise for the prior 48 hours. Participants will enter the clinic, and rest quietly in the supine position for 25 minutes before having blood pressure with a non‐invasive automated cuff and resting metabolic rate via metabolic cart measured. Following resting blood pressure and baseline metabolic rate assessment, blood will be drawn from an antecubital vein. Thereafter, functional metrics will be determined including strength (both upper and lower body muscles; and aerobic capacity (V02peak). Following testing, participants will be provided with a 3‐day diet log (which will be completed every two weeks) and a pedometer. Day 14 (Visit 3); Participants will arrive following an overnight fast (including no caffeine for 12 hours) and having abstained from any exercise for the prior 24 hours. Participants will undergo a DXA. Blood will be drawn from an antecubital vein. Day 49 (Visit 4); Participants will arrive following an overnight fast (including no caffeine for 12 hours) and having abstained from any exercise for the prior 24 hours. Participants will undergo a DXA. Follow‐up ‐ Day 7, 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 63, 70, 77: Participants will receive a weekly phone call to determine their pedometer counts for the week, and to ensure that participants are adhering to the supplement consumption, and to address any concerns. Day 84 (Visit 5); Participants will repeat Day 1 (automated blood pressure, resting and maximal metabolic rate, blood draw, functional metrics. Participants will return their pedometer and remuneration will be processed. Resting metabolic rate (RMR). Participants will be asked to lay still on a bed will connected to a metabolic cart with an on‐line gas collection system (Moxus modular oxygen uptake system, AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA), and the system will acquire oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production data for 15 minutes. Blood sampling. A total of Pedometer. Participants will be given a wearable activity tracker (pedometer). All participants will record their daily totals for subsequent analysis. Study products (active supplement vs. placebo) will be provided in a blinded fashion by Infinit Nutrition Canada (Windsor, Ontario). The active supplement is composed of vitamins, minerals and naturally occurring and plant extracts approved for consumption. Participants will be asked to consume 3 servings of the study product per day (7 days per week) throughout the 12‐wk intervention period. Participants will consume 1 serving immediately before breakfast. Participants will be instructed to consume the supplement in a single sitting, with water, within 5‐10 min. Participants will be instructed to record product intake in a diary to check compliance. Participants will also be asked to maintain the used package and turn it in at the check‐ins as a marker of study compliance. To maintain the double‐blind nature of the experiment, the placebo, which contains microcrystalline cellulose, will be matched in size, appearance, taste and caloric value Three day weighed food record. Participants will be asked to record everything that they consumed for 3 non‐consecutive days: 2 week‐days and either a Saturday or a Sunday. On completion of the food record, it will be analyzed using a commercially available computerized database software (Nutribase version 11.5, Cybersoft Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA). Food items will be aggregated into the following categories: fruit (e.g., fresh/frozen, tinned, juice), vegetables (e.g., fresh/frozen, canned), dairy products (e.g., milk, yoghurt, cheese), breads and cereals (e.g., bread, breakfast cereal, rice, pasta), meats and alternatives (e.g., red meat, poultry, fish, pork, processed meat, tofu, eggs, nuts) and extra foods (e.g., hamburger, pizza, meat pies, chocolate, cake, ice cream, jam, biscuits, crackers, crisps, alcohol etc.). 16 mL blood per visit will be taken from the antecubital vein and drawn into evacuated tubes with heparin used for plasma collection and non‐treated tubes will be used to collect serum. Blood sampling will be used for the following panel of tests: complete blood count (CBC), glucose, Gamma‐Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), bilirubin, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), creatinine, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL, insulin, CRP, and leptin. Waist and hip circumference measures. For waist circumference measurement, the participant will stand with arms at the sides, feet together, and abdomen relaxed. Using a Gulick tape measure, a horizontal measure will be taken at the narrowest part of the torso (above the umbilicus and below the xiphoid process). Obtaining a horizontal measure directly above the iliac crest enhances standardization according to The National Obesity Task Force. For hip circumference measurement, the participant stands erect and feet together, a horizontal measure is taken at the maximal circumference of buttocks. Hand grip strength (MVIC; maximum voluntary isometric contraction). Hand grip strength will be measured using an isometric dynamometer (JAMAR®, Sammons, Bolingbrook, IL). The grip width will be adjusted to hand size and with arm flexed at 90°, the participant will perform three X 5 s efforts with a one min rest between trials. Knee extension (MVIC;maximum voluntary isometric contraction). Isometric knee extension will be measured by mechanical dynamometry (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). Participants will be positioned into the machine with the knee flexed at 90° and perform three X 5s maximal voluntary contractions with 30s rest between each trial. Maximal voluntary VO2peak fitness test. Participants will complete double‐leg incremental peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) tests on a cycle ergometer (Lode, Groningen, the Netherlands). A metabolic cart with an on‐line gas collection system (Moxus modular oxygen uptake system, AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA) will acquire oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) production data. For double‐leg cycling, the test will begin with a 1‐min warm up at 50 watts (W), after which the power will be increased by 1 W every two seconds until volitional exhaustion or the point at which pedal cadence falls below 60 rpm. Heart rate will be monitored continuously throughout the test via telemetry with a heart rate monitor (Polar A3, Lake Success, NY). VO2peak will be defined as the highest oxygen consumption achieved over a 30‐s period. Maximal workload (Wmax) will be the highest power output achieved during the test. After the completion of the test, the participant will be asked to perform a 2‐3‐minute active recovery pedaling against no resistance. Dual X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) and blood pressure. A DXA scan is a non‐invasive procedure requiring the participant to only lay still on a padded table. It is a fast procedure that provides a variety of body composition variables (bone mass/area/density, fat mass, and fat free mass). The DXA scan exposes individuals to low levels of radiation, approximately 0.18 millirem. According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Americans receive approximately 620 millirem each year, half of which is due to environmental background radiation. Radiation exposure can be due to medical treatments or procedures, like X‐Ray or MRI's, food, sun exposure, etc. Any exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer. In the present study, body composition will be assessed using DXA scan (GE Lunar Prodigy, Madison, WI) and a software program for adults (encore Version 9.15.010). Fat free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the entire body will be recorded. Arterial blood pressure (i.e., systolic [SBP] and diastolic [DBP]) will be measured during rest with a stethoscope (Marshall Nurse Stethoscope, Riverside, Ill., USA) and sphygmomanometer (MDF Instruments Direct Inc., Agoura Hills, Calif., USA). Questionnaires. The RAND 36‐Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well‐being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. The Get Active Questionnaire by CSEP is a 2‐page, self‐administered, pre‐participation for exercise screening tool. Potential participants must answer 'no' to all questions on the Get Active Questionnaire. Leg press 1RM. Assessment procedures for determining lower body strength using leg press exercise equipment (Cybex Eagle ®, Medway, MA) will require the participant to sit in the leg press machine with the right foot and left foot on the weight platform. The seat and back pad will be adjusted so that feet are flat on the platform hip‐width apart, toes slightly angled out, and legs parallel to each other. The interviewer will then instruct the participant to grasp the handles or sides of the seat and extend their legs leaving just a slight bend in the knee. Next, the participant will remove the racking mechanism from the platform and grasp the handles or seat again. The participant will begin with a selected weight that is within their perceived ability, approximately 60 to 80% of maximum capacity (make an educated guess). The participant will lower the platform slowly and controlled towards the chest, keeping the hips and buttocks on the seat, and the back flat against the back pad. Once the thighs are parallel to the platform the participant will extend the legs, pushing the weight back to the start position as hard and as fast as possible. The participant will be instructed to not allow their hips to shift to one side, the buttocks to rise, or knees to move inward or outward during this exercise. The interviewer will also instruct the participant to keep heels flat and not allow the knees to go beyond the toes. Once the repetitions are completed, the participant will replace the racking mechanism and exit the leg press. These procedures were adapted from procedures described by the National Strength and Condition Association (2008) and the American College of Sports Medicine (2013).

N2  -  Background: Women with breast cancer account for the largest cohort (23%) of over 18 million cancer survivors in the United States. Of the nearly 4 million breast cancer survivors, many, including individuals with metastatic breast cancer, will require lifelong treatment for chronic conditions. As part of a multi‐site study including diverse tumor types, breast cancer survivors are being recruited to explore the feasibility and outcomes of a digital health coaching (DHC) program following the completion of primary therapy to support self‐management of symptoms and general wellness. Trial design: A randomized‐wait list control design will evaluate outcomes related to engagement in a DHC program following completion of primary therapy. Participants will be enrolled in a 6‐month DHC program delivering evidence‐based content via weekly calls, text, and email, in addition to usual support from their respective healthcare teams. The intervention group will receive coaching upon enrollment. The control group will receive coaching after a 6‐month monitoring period. Twelve months of longitudinal clinical, patient‐reported outcomes, activity tracking (via Fitbit), and microbiome data will be collected from both groups. Eligibility criteria: The breast cancer cohort will consist of individuals with both localized and metastatic disease within 1 year of completion of primary therapy, defined as treatment of curative intent, first‐line or later, from which the individual is advancing to active surveillance or follow‐up, with or without maintenance therapy. All study participants must be >18 years old, able to read and speak English, have access to mobile technology, and agree to wear and have data collected from an activity tracker. Specific aims: 1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a DHC program and its effect on participant health selfefficacy; 2) characterize associations between participant symptoms, physical/psychosocial wellbeing, and health self‐management and gut microbiota changes; and 3) explore patient‐generated health data outcomes among participants (patient reported and wearable biometrics outcomes). Statistical methods: Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed through descriptive statistics. Feasibility for this study is defined as a retention rate ≥70%, and acceptability is defined as ≤20% scoring “not at all helpful.” Secondary aims will be assessed using linear mixed models. Crosscohort analysis of physical function, measured by the PROMiS Physical Function 10a, will be conducted. Assuming a power of 0.8 and significance level of .05, we will be able to detect a 2.51 difference in PROMiS score means between the control and intervention group (SD 10) with a sample of 500 total participants. Sub‐group analysis will be conducted with the anticipated 250 participants in the breast cancer cohort with a focus on feasibility, acceptability, and descriptive and exploratory endpoints for this population as a whole and comparing early stage and metastatic participants. Target and present accruals: 500 individuals with diverse tumor types will be enrolled across 5 collaborating sites, of which 4 ill include individuals with breast cancer. An estimated 250 breast cancer participants (approximately 50% of the total study population), including 150 with de novo or progressive metastatic breast cancer, are planned to be recruited. To date, 1 Midwestern site has enrolled the first 7 breast cancer survivors. Two additional sites plan to enroll in July 2022, with the remaining 2 sites to begin enrollment by the end of 2022.

N2  -  The long‐term goal is to develop effective ways to improve glycemic control in youth with T1D. To that end, we propose to specifically evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, and usability of two new interventions in diabetes care: an automated meal detection and patient engagement device to promote meal‐time insulin dosing behavior (AIM2DOSE) and an economic incentive (COIN2DOSE) to promote patient engagement with mealtime insulin dosing behavior. If initially efficacious, our results will serve as the basis for an R01 submission(s) to conduct a fully powered efficacy trial of AIM2DOSE and COIN2DOSE. This study is significant as omission of mealtime boluses is one of the common reasons for suboptimal diabetes control in youth. This project is highly innovative because it will: 1) target youth who are predicted by artificial intelligence to experience a worsening in glycemic control, 2) use a just‐in‐time intervention to improve mealtime insulin dosing behavior, and 3) use an economic incentive intervention to improve mealtime insulin dosing behavior. Study Design The study is an unblinded, 3‐arm, randomized, controlled trial. After successful screening and consent, individuals will wear a blinded Dexcom G6 Pro CGM inserted 1 week after consent. . At the baseline visit (visit 1; day 1), participants will be randomized to the AIM2DOSE, COIN2DOSE, or control treatment arms and will be trained on the procedures appropriate to their treatment arm. . Participants will also complete baseline measures by questionnaire. Participants will complete procedures specific to their treatment arm weekly. Visit 2 will occur after 12 weeks (90 days). Participants will stop any treatment interventions after this visit. A1C and questionnaire measures will be completed, and participants will again wear the Dexcom G6 Pro CGM for 10 days (the device will be returned by mail post‐visit). Participants will receive no treatment intervention from week 13 to week 24. Participants will return for visit 3 at week 24. Again, A1C and questionnaire measures will be completed and participants will wear the Dexcom G6 Pro CGM for 10 days. All study participants will also have the option to participate in a focus group discussion (FGD) on general AI ethical issues (control group) or intervention experiences (intervention group). Parents of children who meet inclusion criteria may also elect to participate in a focus group. Study Visits Study visits may occur in‐person or remotely (i.e., from home). Procedures will be adapted to accommodate both scenarios. Individuals who have been predicted via an artificial intelligence‐intelligence based model to experience a rise in A1C in the near future (90 days) will be approached for recruitment. 36 participants will be recruited from the Children's Mercy Diabetes Center (any clinic or hospital location). Based on preliminary data review of our clinic population, there were at least 81 individuals who met inclusion criteria who were seen in clinic in the month of May 2019 alone. Patients will be randomized to AIM2DOSE, COIN2DOSE, or control group using a 1:1:1 randomization scheme. Intervention: To identify an at‐risk population for more intensive intervention opportunities, the Children's Mercy Diabetes Center now routinely uses a validated prediction model based on advanced machine learning (random forest method) and natural language processing to identify individuals who are predicted experience a rise in A1C in the next 90 days. The model analyzes all patients who presented for a diabetes visit in the prior week. To accomplish this task, the complete health record for the CMH Diabetes Center registry is analyzed. We will select patients from this cohort for recruitment into the present study. AIM2DOSE intervention: The intervention consists of a Klue app that currently works with the Apple Watch. Users of the app must wear the watch on their dominant hand. The app constantly evaluates the movement of each participant's dominant hand by analyzing signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope in the device. By evaluating a real‐time accelerometer and gyroscope data, the app can accurately identify repetitive movements that are consistent with eating. The software detects nearly 100% of meals within the first five minutes with very few false positives. Furthermore, the app correctly distinguishes between sips and bites 98% of the time. This novel use of a commonly available "health wearable" has not previously been reported as an adjunct to diabetes care in youth. COIN2DOSE intervention: From one‐week post‐randomization to the 12‐week study visit, youth randomized to this treatment arm will receive personalized feedback via monetary incentives for dosing insulin at mealtimes. We will define mealtimes based on hour of the day and the presence of a carbohydrate entry associated with the insulin bolus. Breakfast will be 0600‐1000, lunch will be 1100‐1500, and dinner will be 1600‐2000. Thus, we will reimburse youth per mealtime with at least one meal‐associated (carbohydrate‐associated) insulin bolus completed. We will offer the opportunity for youth to earn a bonus reimbursement for weeks during which they achieve at least 5 days of 3 mealtime insulin boluses. Finally, we will pay youth per week for sharing their insulin use data at least two times per week with the study team during the three‐month treatment phase.

N2  -  Objective: To describe the deployment of a wireless remote inertial sensing system to monitor and influence the amount of walking practice during inpatient rehabilitation after stroke. Background: The amount of active therapy provided to patients during inpatient stroke rehabilitation is estimated to be rather modest. Efforts to objectively and continuously quantify gait training after hemiplegic stroke have been hampered by the cost or insensitivity of commercially available devices to record the slow speeds and asymmetric movements typically seen after stroke. Using a system of wearable inertial sensors and machine‐learning algorithms, the SIRRACT trial (Stroke Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement of ACTivity, NCT01246882) aimed to increase the time patients spent walking during inpatient rehabilitation by providing personalized feedback. Methods: Trial participants were recruited from 12 international (Egypt, India, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, and Turkey) and 4 American rehabilitation centers. Inclusion criteria were stroke within the past month requiring inpatient rehabilitation, residual hemiparesis, and the ability to walk at least 5 steps on study entry. During the trial, all individuals participated in standard rehabilitative therapies while wearing triaxial accelerometers at both ankles to record purposeful activities, including walking. Sensor data were uploaded nightly to a central server at UCLA for processing. The wireless system used Bayesian machine‐learning algorithms and individual gait templates to identify bouts of walking from within daily activity recordings. Parameters were calculated for each walking bout (speed, duration) and each day's activity (number of bouts, average walking speed, total time spent walking, total distance, total steps). Half the participants were randomly assigned to receive sensor‐ derived feedback about walking performance 3 days a week and the other half to feedback about walking speed only. Results: In all, 151 participants underwent randomization. Patients with a range of disabilities and initial walking speeds, some as low as 0.2 m/s, were included. More than 2000 days of therapy were recorded by study completion. Sensors were actively recording data for more than 8 hours a day. The system identified 37 000 discrete walking episodes containing more than 2.5 million steps. Therapy‐related activities, including cycling, leg extensions, and knee extensions were also automatically identified by the system. Results of the effects of higher levels of feedback will be presented. Conclusions: This trial demonstrates, for the first time, the feasibility of using inexpensive wireless health technology to remotely monitor the activity of disabled persons in the acute rehabilitation setting. Problem solving challenges for expanding activity monitoring into the outpatient and home care settings will be discussed.

N2  -  Background: Gamification is the use of game design elements such as points and levels in non‐game contexts. Gamification is used commonly within workplace wellness programs and digital health applications; however, its effectiveness has been limited. A significant opportunity is to incorporate principles from behavioral economics, which have been effective in informing intervention designs that achieve sustained improvements in health behavior by addressing the 'predictable irrationality' of humans. The investigators' group has conducted two successful clinical trials using gamification and either collaboration or competition to increase physical activity in other settings. The investigators have conducted three pilot studies with Veterans to tailor these approaches to their specific needs and experiences. Significance: Higher levels of regular physical activity are associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and mortality. Despite this, more than half of Veterans do not achieve enough physical activity to obtain these benefits. Innovation and Impact: This will be one of the first clinical trials to incorporate behavioral economic principles and social incentives within the design of gamification to increase physical activity among obese Veterans with hypertension. It will also be one of the first to directly examine the impact of these interventions on clinical outcomes associated with increased physical activity and examine cost‐effectiveness To improve scalability and decrease burden on Veterans, the entire study will be conducted completed remotely including enrollment and interventions. Moreover, the investigators will use state‐of‐the‐art statistical and machine learning techniques to examine personalization of interventions. Specific Aims: Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification with collaboration or competition to increase physical activity . Aim 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of gamification to improve clinical outcomes. Aim 3: To conduct a qualitative process evaluation and implementation analysis to inform implementation efforts within VA. Aim 4: To conduct a quantitative evaluation of Veteran characteristics related to demographics, past experiences, social networks, and other factors to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects. Aim 5: To assess the cost‐effectiveness of the gamification interventions. Methodology: Obese Veterans with hypertension will be enrolled into a three‐arm randomized, controlled trial comprised of a 6‐month intervention and a 3‐month follow‐up. Wearable devices will be used to passively monitor physical activity levels. Clinical outcomes will be captured by digital weight scales and blood pressure cuffs through video conferencing. Interventions will be deployed using Way to Health, a technology platform that the investigators have demonstrated is feasible to use within the VA Health System. Outcomes will include physical activity in steps (primary), minutes of moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity (secondary), changes in clinical outcomes of weight and systolic blood pressure (secondary), change in minutes of sleep (exploratory), and cost of implementation (exploratory). Next Steps/Implementation: The implementation analysis, which includes cost‐effectiveness analysis and qualitative interviews with Veterans and key VA stakeholders, will inform implementation of the program in VA. The investigators have support from the following three operational partners to implement key learnings into existing VA programs: VA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention including MOVE!, VA Office of Connected Care, and the VA Chief Improvement and Analytics Officer.

N2  -  The present study is a randomized double‐blind placebo controlled repeated measures design, with sampling of the cohorts on multiple occasions. Upon obtaining informed consent participants will be randomized into one of six groups: Healthy younger males ‐ n=20; Healthy older males ‐ placebo n=10, supplement n=10; Sarcopenic older males, placebo, n=20, supplement n=20; Take home resistance training program The older adult male groups will be provided with a progressive resistance training program which will use exercise bands (Therabands®, Akron, Ohio) and consist of six upper body and six lower body exercises, which will be performed three times per week for 12 weeks without supervision at home. Each session will consist of active warm‐up (5min), resistance training with elastic tubing (45min), and cool down (5min). Briefly, the resistance exercises will be performed using elastic tubing for chair squats, hip flexions, leg extensions, leg flexions, ankle dorsiflexion, wall push‐ups, back rows, shoulder abductions, triceps extensions, and forearm flexions. Ankle plantar‐flexions and abdominal curl‐ups will be performed using body weight as resistance. Each participant will be given an exercise instruction booklet and a set of five elastic tubes offering different resistances. Prior to beginning the program trained staff will meet with participants and will teach them how to properly perform exercises in addition to determining the starting elastic tubing size. Furthermore, participants will perform one set of each exercise during weeks 1 and 2, two sets of each exercise during weeks 3 and 4, and three sets of lower body and two sets of upper body exercises during the remaining weeks. Participants will be instructed to move to the next larger tubing size when they can perform 12 repetitions with good exercise form during their last set. This progression will be monitored by the project staff mid way through the study over the phone. Study products Study products will be provided by Infinit Nutrition Canada (Windsor, Ontario) to all older male subjects, however the young males will only act as baseline controls. The composition of the study products is displayed above in the general experimental design. Both products are similar in taste and appearance and provide an energetic value of ∼200 kcal per serving in a volume of 200 mL. Participants will be asked to consume 1 serving daily of the study product throughout the 12‐wk intervention period. Participants will consume their serving at approximately the same time of day, but preferably before breakfast. Participants will be instructed to consume the supplement as a single bolus within 5‐10 min. Subjects will also also be provided an omega‐3 supplement (or placebo, if they are assigned to the placebo arm) and be instructed to consume 2 teaspoons at the same time as their nutritional supplement. Participants will be instructed to record product intake in a diary to check compliance. To maintain the double‐blind nature of the experiment, the placebos, which contains microcrystalline cellulose or safflower oil, will be matched in size and appearance. Pedometer Participants will be given a wearable activity tracker, and instructed on weight training days to aim for 5,000 steps and on all other days to try and reach 10,000. All participants will record their daily totals for subsequent analysis. 25 mg) for RNA, a small piece ( 10 mg) will be placed into chilled glutaraldehyde for subsequent electron microscopic evaluation, 20 mg will be frozen for mtDNA deletions, and 50 mg will be frozen for enzyme and protein analysis. The investigators will measure muscle anabolic signaling as previously reported. Three day weighed food record Participants will be asked to record everything that they consumed for 3 nonconsecutive days: 2 week‐days and either a Saturday or a Sunday. On completion of the food record, it will be analyzed using a commercially available computerized database software (Nutribase version 11.5, Cybersoft Inc., Phoenix, AZ, USA). Food items will be aggregated into the following categories: fruit (e.g., fresh/frozen, tinned, juice), vegetables (e.g., fresh/frozen, canned), dairy products (e.g., milk, yoghurt, cheese), breads and cereals (e.g., bread, breakfast cereal, rice, pasta), meats and alternatives (e.g., red meat, poultry, fish, pork, processed meat, tofu, eggs, nuts) and extra foods (e.g., hamburger, pizza, meat pies, chocolate, cake, ice cream, jam, biscuits, crackers, crisps, alcohol). Dual X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) and blood pressure A DXA scan is a non‐invasive procedure requiring the participant to only lay still on a padded table. It is a fast procedure that provides a variety of body composition variables (bone mass/area/density, fat mass, and fat free mass). The DXA scan exposes individuals to low levels of radiation, approximately 0.18 millirem. According to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Americans receive approximately 620 millirem each year, half of which is due to environmental background radiation. Radiation exposure can be due to medical treatments or procedures, like X‐Ray or MRI's, food, sun exposure, etc. Any exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer. In the present study, body composition will be assessed using DXA scan (GE Lunar Prodigy, Madison, WI) and a software program for adults (encore Version 9.15.010). Fat free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the entire body will be recorded. Arterial blood pressure (i.e., systolic [SBP] and diastolic [DBP]) will be measured during rest with a stethoscope (Marshall Nurse Stethoscope, Riverside, Ill., USA) and sphygmomanometer (MDF Instruments Direct Inc., Agoura Hills, Calif., USA). Muscle biopsies Participants will arrive in the morning in the fasted state and rest quietly in the supine position for 10 minutes. A muscle biopsy will then be taken from the vastus lateralis using local anaesthetic. Samples will be dissected free of connective tissue and immediately partitioned for subsequent analysis ( Blood sampling A total of 100 mL blood will be taken from the antecubital vein and drawn into evacuated tubes with heparin used for plasma collection and non‐treated tubes will be used to collect serum. Waist and hip circumference measures For waist circumference measurement, the participant will stand with arms at the sides, feet together, and abdomen relaxed. Using a Gulick tape measure, a horizontal measure will be taken at the narrowest part of the torso (above the umbilicus and below the xiphoid process). Obtaining a horizontal measure directly above the iliac crest enhances standardization according to The National Obesity Task Force. For hip circumference measurement, the participant stands erect and feet together, a horizontal measure is taken at the maximal circumference of buttocks. Hand grip strength (MVIC) Hand grip strength will be measured using an isometric dynamometer (JAMAR®, Sammons, Bolingbrook, IL). The grip width will be adjusted to hand size and with arm flexed at 90°, the participant will perform three X 5 s efforts with a one min rest between trials. Physical performance battery A total of four functional tasks will be performed once using a stopwatch that records times to an accuracy 1/100 of a second. First, the 6‐minute walk test will involve participants walking as fast as possible around a 20m track for 6 minutes and distance will be measured to the closest meter. Next, the standard 4‐stair climb test will involve participants climbing 4 stairs as fast as possible. A 5x sit‐to‐stand test will involve participants performing a series of consecutive rising and sitting positions from a sturdy, armless plastic chair secured against a wall and with arms crossed at the chest. Finally, the chair rise‐and‐walk test will involve participants starting from a seated position, standing up and walking as quickly as possible in a predetermined straight line to a pylon 9.14m, while going around the pylon, and returning to their original seated position. Leg press 1RM Assessment procedures for determining lower body strength using leg press exercise equipment (Cybex Eagle ®, Medway, MA) will require the participant to sit in the leg press machine with the right foot and left foot on the weight platform. The seat and back pad will be adjusted so that feet are flat on the platform hip‐width apart, toes slightly angled out, and legs parallel to each other. The interviewer will then instruct the participant to grasp the handles or sides of the seat and extend their legs leaving just a slight bend in the knee. Next, the participant will remove the racking mechanism from the platform and grasp the handles or seat again. The participant will begin with a selected weight that is within their perceived ability, approximately 60 to 80% of maximum capacity (make an educated guess). The participant will lower the platform slowly and controlled towards the chest, keeping the hips and buttocks on the seat, and the back flat against the back pad. Once the thighs are parallel to the platform the participant will extend the legs, pushing the weight back to the start position as hard and as fast as possible. The participant will be instructed to not allow their hips to shift to one side, the buttocks to rise, or knees to move inward or outward during this exercise. The interviewer will also instruct the participant to keep heels flat and not allow the knees to go beyond the toes. Once the repetitions are completed, the participant will replace the racking mechanism and exit the leg press. These procedures were adapted from procedures described by the National Strength and Condition Association (2008) and the American College of Sports Medicine (2013). Knee extension (MVIC) Isometric knee extension will be measured by mechanical dynamometry (Biodex System 3, Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY). Participants will be positioned into the machine with the knee flexed at 90° and perform three X 5s maximal voluntary contractions with 30s rest between each trial. SF‐36 Quality of health Questionnaire The RAND 36‐Item Health Survey (Version 1.0) taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well‐being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health.

N2  -  Background and Aims: Exposure to extremely low frequency and low intensity electromagnetic fields (ELF‐EMF) increases plasticity‐related processes, with associated clinical improvements. The purpose of this RCT was to explore the benefit of BrainQ's novel and non‐invasive, brain‐computer interface‐based, frequency‐tuned ELF‐EMF treatment (BQ) in improving upper extremity motor function (UEMF) in subacute ischemic stroke. Methods: Study was planned for n=50, but was discontinued due to COVID‐19 at n=25. Participants were randomized to receive 40 minutes of BQ (active or sham) 5 days/week, for 8 weeks, with 10 minutes of PT. BQ uses machine learning algorithms to extract motor‐related spectral features in EEG for use as treatment frequencies, and is delivered via a wearable and portable device. Results: Primary endpoint: Fugl‐Meyer Assessment ‐ Upper Extremity improved significantly (and sooner) in the treatment group versus sham at W4 (23.2±3.91 vs. 9.9±3.2; 13.6 points greater than sham p=0.0070) and after 8 weeks of treatment (31.5±2.97 vs. 23.1±4.99; p=0.0611). Secondary endpoints: Most strikingly, and as a major clinical indication of reduced disability, mRS, at W9 the treatment group showed a mean improvement of 2.5±0.18 points versus 1.3±0.16 points in the sham group (p=0.0005), i.e., a mean of 1.2 points higher than that of the sham group. Significant improvements were also observed in the ARAT‐Pinch subscale (W9: p=0.0082), BBT (W6: p=0.0169; W9: p<0.0001), and NIHSS (W9: p=0.0340). Conclusions: BQ treatment significantly improves UEMF and reduces disability in subacute ischemic stroke across multiple metrics. A pivotal study is planned, with an explicit motivation of moving toward home use, for a more patient‐centric approach.

N2  -  Abstract Background: Exposure of the central nervous system to extremely low frequency and low intensity electromagnetic fields (ELF‐EMF) increases plasticity‐related processes, with associated clinical improvements. Aim: The purpose of this RCT was to explore the benefit of BrainQ’s novel and non‐invasive stimulation device which uses frequency‐tuned ELF‐EMF treatment (BQ) to reduce general disability and improve upper extremity motor function (UEMF) in subacute ischemic stroke. Methods: Study was planned for n=50, but was discontinued due to COVID‐19 at n=25. Participants were randomized to receive 40 minutes of BQ (active or sham) 5 days/week, for 8 weeks, with 10 minutes of PT.

N2  -  Stroke is the leading cause of neurological disability in the United States and accounts for the poor physical health and the social dysfunction evident in survivors. Gait impairment is a large contributor to long‐term disability and ambulatory function in daily living. Many patients, however, lose the ability to walk independently, and furthermore, a large proportion does not regain their normal walking speeds following a stroke. In this context, newer robotic‐aided therapeutic tools such as "wearable" lower‐limb robotic exoskeletons have been developed, which allow for the user to be augmented by mechanically actuated lower limb joints that can either completely or partially assist movements of the lower limb segments depending on the patient needs. The H2 exoskeleton (developed by Technaid S.L., Spain) is an example of one such system that has hip, knee and ankle joints actuated for both lower limbs. These devices are very new, and therefore, systematic investigations of therapeutic benefits of these devices are lacking in the field. Further, the nature of plasticity in the brain triggered by wearing and training such exoskeletons is unknown. In this exploratory research study, the investigators aim to compare robotic‐assisted rehabilitation using the H2 exoskeleton with supervised motor practice particularly in terms of functional recovery. Additionally, this study will also examine brain plasticity associated with robotic‐assisted training using non‐invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and changes in lower limb joint kinematics during robotic‐assisted training. Taken together, the findings from this research will be used to understand human‐robot interaction and to design smart powered orthotic devices that can be controlled directly by brain activity and assist those that have lost all or part of their walking abilities due to neurological disease or injury. Moreover, this study will systematically track neuroplasticity associated with functional recovery after stroke, which will help determine optimal windows for treatment that would maximize therapeutic benefit. Lastly, it will also help characterize markers of learning to use these new devices, which will be important in the clinical setting for modifying and adapting rehabilitation protocols to suit changing needs of the patient (user).

N2  -  Background: Automatic measurement of respiratory rate in general hospital patients is difficult. Patient movement degrades the signal and variation of the breathing cycle means that accurate observation for ⩾60 s is needed for adequate precision. Methods: We studied acutely ill patients recently admitted to a teaching hospital. Breath duration was measured from a triaxial accelerometer attached to the chest wall and compared with a signal from a nasal cannula. We randomly divided the patient records into a training (n=54) and a test set (n=7). We used machine learning to train a neural network to select reliable signals, automatically identifying signal features associated with accurate measurement of respiratory rate. We used the test records to assess the accuracy of the device, indicated by the median absolute difference between respiratory rates, provided by the accelerometer and by the nasal cannula. Results: In the test set of patients, machine classification of the respiratory signal reduced the median absolute difference (interquartile range) from 1.25 (0.56–2.18) to 0.48 (0.30–0.78) breaths per min. 50% of the recording periods were rejected as unreliable and in one patient, only 10% of the signal time was classified as reliable. However, even only 10% of observation time would allow accurate measurement for 6 min in an hour of recording, giving greater reliability than nurse charting, which is based on much less observation time. Conclusion: Signals from a body‐mounted accelerometer yield accurate measures of respiratory rate, which could improve automatic illness scoring in adult hospital patients.

N2  -  Background: Over a third of excess coronary heart disease mortality in the US is related to inadequate physical activity (PA). Use of wearable activity trackers is beneficial for PA improvement in many populations. However, predictors of long‐term adherence to PA remain unknown. Hypothesis: The 1st week PA levels will be the strongest predictors of long‐term adherence to the PA goal in adults with overweight or obesity in a mHealth weight loss intervention trial. Methods: A secondary analysis of a 12‐month behavioral weight loss trial (SMARTER) that randomized 502 participants to either self‐monitoring with tailored feedback messages (SM+FB, n=251) or self‐monitoring alone (SM, n=251) was conducted. At baseline, each participant received a Fitbit Charge 2 and PA goal of ≥150 minutes of moderate or vigorous activity (MVPA) per week. The outcome of interest for this analysis was long‐term PA adherence, i.e., the number of weeks adherent to PA goal over 12 months. Twenty‐six explanatory variables were considered, including treatment assignment; baseline socio‐demographics; health history; body mass index (<30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2); psychosocial factors; and1st week PA levels (<150 vs. ≥150 MVPA min/week). Machine learning methods (i.e., random forest regression trees and lasso regression) were used to identify predictors of long‐term PA adherence. Results: The sample ranged in age from 19 to 75 years (57% were <50 years old), and was mostly Caucasian (83%), female (80%) and had a mean BMI 33.7 ± 4.0 kg/m2. The sample was randomly split 4:1 into training (n=394) and validation subsamples (n=104) which were comparable by treatment assignment. Both random forest and lasso regression identified 1st week PA levels as the most important predictor of long‐term PA adherence. The findings were confirmed in the validation cohort with an out‐of‐sample R‐square of 40.2% from random forest and a R‐square of 47.9% from lasso regression, suggesting good predictive abilities. Conclusion: This analysis confirmed higher initial PA levels as the strongest predictor of long‐term PA adherence. The findings support screening for PA at study entry and developing tailored interventions for those with lower initial PA levels.

N2  -  Anxiety is a prevalent, persistent, and disabling co‐morbidity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition to its profound negative impact on physical and mental health, anxiety interacts with the core deficits of ASD to exacerbate symptomatology and increase functional impairment. Anxiety treatments efficacious in non‐ASD children (e.g., Cognitive‐Behavioural Therapy (CBT)) often have reduced potency and limited applicability in the ASD population due to impairments in cognitive ability, communication, emotional awareness, and introspection. Despite the urgency to treat co‐morbid anxiety in ASD, there is limited evidence supporting treatment programs in higher‐functioning individuals, and no evidence for those who are lower‐functioning. In light of the urgent need for treatment of co‐morbid anxiety in ASD and the paucity of evidence in this area, the investigators propose a study to establish early evidence on a technology‐supported treatment of anxiety in children with ASD. This approach aims to reduce ASD‐related barriers to treatment (e.g., deficits in emotional awareness and introspection) by providing children with a visual, real time display of their arousal level. The proposed treatment focuses on the physiological arousal associated with anxiety. In particular, the investigators propose to use a physiological indicator of anxiety that can objectively measure and promote awareness of physiological arousal. To this end, the investigators have developed the Anxiety Meter, a device that measures arousal‐related increases in heart rate using non‐invasive wearable sensors and translates these to a visual display of the child's arousal level on a tablet computer. The investigators research questions are: 1. Primary: Does the Anxiety Meter improve awareness and management of physiological arousal induced by anxiogenic stimuli in a controlled setting? Hypothesis: The Anxiety Meter will improve awareness and management of symptoms because it promotes awareness of arousal ‐ a skill which is impaired in ASD. 2. Secondary: What demographic and cognitive and behavioural variables predict response to the Anxiety Meter? Hypothesis: Age, IQ, sex, and severity of anxiety symptoms at baseline will affect treatment response. To investigate the above questions, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial comparing the Anxiety Meter to a control condition in children with ASD. Both the treatment and control groups will be taught a relaxation technique (three training sessions) and will be asked to apply the technique in a controlled anxiety‐inducing task (one testing session). During the testing session, participants will be seated in front of a computer screen and will complete five tasks: 1. Baseline (30 minutes): Participants will watch an animated movie clip. This task has been used successfully as a "baseline activity" in the investigators previous studies in the target population. 2. Anxiety condition 1 (2 minutes): In this task, participants will be given 2 minutes to prepare a 3‐minute talk. They will be told that the talk will be delivered to an audience of 3 strangers. 3. Intervention (5 minutes): Both groups will use this time to reflect on their anxiety level and apply the relaxation technique if they feel anxious. Only the treatment group will receive a real‐time display of physiological arousal on the Anxiety Meter. The control group will have the Anxiety Meter, but the marker will not move. The investigators previous studies indicate that five minutes is sufficient for the heart rate to return to baseline. 5. Return‐to‐baseline (15 minutes): Participants will watch an animated movie clip. 4. Anxiety condition 2 (3 minutes): Participants will deliver a 3‐minute talk to an audience of 3 strangers. They will receive a prompt to alert them of the remaining speaking time every minute.

KW  -  Stroke
N2  -  Stroke is the second leading cause of death and disability globally and the absolute number of people who have had a new stroke, died, survived or remained disabled from stroke has almost doubled between 1990 and 2017 (Krishnamurthi, Ikeda, & Feigin, 2020). Meta‐analytic evidence demonstrates that the 1‐ and 5‐year risk of recurrent stroke is 11.1% and 26.4%, respectively (Mohan et al., 2011). Recurrent stroke can be prevented by improving identified, modifiable risk factors including clinical conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and obesity) and lifestyle factors (smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, and excess alcohol consumption) (Bridgwood et al., 2018). Despite advances in acute stroke intervention, secondary prevention strategies are lacking and require urgent attention (McElwaine, McCormack, & Harbison, 2016). Physical activity is the second‐largest predictor of stroke (O'Donnell et al., 2016). Recent secondary prevention guidelines state that people with stoke, when able, should aim to achieve population‐based recommendations for physical activity (40‐minute sessions, 3 to 4 times per week of moderate to vigorous‐intensity aerobic activity) (Kleindorfer et al., 2021). People with stroke have additional barriers to physical activity, such as muscle weakness, sensory dysfunction, reduced balance, and fatigue (Billinger et al., 2014). Consequently, physical activity levels of community‐dwelling people with stroke remain lower than their age‐matched counterparts (English et al., 2016), and people with stroke typically sit for more than 10 hours per day (Saunders, Mead, Fitzsimons, Kelly, van Wijck, Verschuren, Backx, et al., 2021). Given the heterogeneous nature of stroke, physical activity interventions which are adaptive to individual performance are recommended (Billinger et al., 2014). A Cochrane review on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour (any waking behaviour characterized by an energy expenditure <1.5 METS while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture [Ainsworth 2011]). post‐stroke found that all included studies were at high or unclear risk of bias (Saunders, Mead, Fitzsimons, Kelly, van Wijck, Verschuren, Backx, et al., 2021). The analysis found that interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour do not reduce cardiovascular other adverse events or amount of time spent sitting. The authors highlight that the current World Health Organization guidelines recommend reducing the amount of sedentary time in people with disabilities, in general (Saunders, Mead, Fitzsimons, Kelly, van Wijck, Verschuren, & English, 2021; WHO, 2020). They conclude that interventions for people with stroke should focus on other therapeutic targets, such as increasing physical activity, to reduce sitting time (Saunders, Mead, Fitzsimons, Kelly, van Wijck, Verschuren, & English, 2021). The effectiveness of exercise interventions on death, disability and adverse events among people with stroke compared to treatment as usual control was examined in a Cochrane review including fifty‐eight trials (n= 2797) (Saunders et al., 2020). Disability outcome showed moderate improvement after cardiorespiratory training (SMD)= 0.52, 95% CI=0.19‐0.84; p=0.002) and by a small amount after mixed training (SMD=0.26, 95%=CI 0.04‐0.49; p=0.02). Most of the studies were small and of moderate quality, demonstrating high and unclear risk of bias throughout. The variability and quality of the included trials and lack of data prevents conclusions about other outcomes and limits generalisability of the observed results. A systematic review investigated the effects of interventions to promote participation in lifestyle physical activity in community‐dwelling stroke survivors (Morris, MacGillivray, & Mcfarlane, 2014). Two intervention types were identified: individualised tailored counselling with or without supervised exercise (n=6 studies) and supervised exercise with advice (n=5 studies). Interventions to improve participation in physical activity should incorporate physical activity‐specific tailored counselling based on sound behavioural theory to promote long‐term participation in physical activity post‐stroke. A systematic review examining the study characteristics and the promise of interventions targeting free‐living PA and/or sedentary behaviour in people with stroke included nine RCTs (n=717)(Moore et al., 2018). Moore et al. (2018) identified nine BCT's most likely to increase physical activity in people with stroke: action planning, goal setting (behaviour), credible source, social support (unspecified), problem solving, biofeedback, feedback on behaviour, information about health consequences, and information about social and environmental consequences. A systematic review and qualitative synthesis of users' experiences of using mHealth applications to promote physical activity was conducted in October 2017 (Carter, Robinson, Forbes, & Hayes, 2018). Studies were limited to qualitative research and the experiences of adults who had used mHealth to promote PA. The search yielded 4,420 studies, of which 16 studies (n=361 participants) were included. Six themes related to the experience of using mHealth to promote physical activity were generated inductively: (a) increased physical activity as a result of mHealth, (b) motivation, (c) self‐monitoring, (d) personalised/ tailored mHealth, (e) technical issues, and (f) social features. Overall, mHealth applications were perceived positively by participants. However, some noted negative experiences, particularly in the face of technical issues, competition or anxiety around self‐monitoring. The results highlight the paucity of qualitative research in this area post‐stroke and indicate that further qualitative research is warranted to guide the design of future mHealth interventions post‐stroke (Carter et al., 2018). The findings of a recent Cochrane review demonstrate that there is currently not enough evidence (four small RCTs with 274 participants) to support the use of activity monitors to increase PA after stroke, with authors outlining the need for further research (Lynch et al., 2018). Effective clinical management of stroke often requires a sequence of treatments, each adapted to individual response, and hence multiple treatment decisions throughout the course of an individual's rehabilitation (Murphy, 2005). However, there is a lack of empirical data on the optimum sequence of these treatments. Due to the once‐off randomisation of participants at baseline, a standard Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) design, the gold‐standard for the examination of causal relationships, does not enable the required flexibility to deliver and evaluate an adaptive intervention that is responsive to patient needs. RCTs are not designed to assess the effectiveness of individual intervention components. Adaptive RCT designs, such as Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomised Trials (SMART), can identify non‐responders and allow for the empirical adaptation of subsequent physical activity treatments to realise larger benefits for some and reduce the use of less‐effective therapies for many. SMARTs have been developed for the purpose of designing optimal adaptive interventions (Murphy, 2005). SMARTs are factorial designs in a sequential setting and can be described as multi‐stage randomised controlled trial designs (Almirall, Nahum‐Shani, Sherwood, & Murphy, 2014; Murphy, 2005). Each stage corresponds to a decision stage. All SMART participants are randomised at least once and some or all participants may be randomised more than once throughout the course of the trial. By enabling repeated randomisations of participants to treatments, the current study will use a SMART to design and evaluate an optimum adaptive physical activity intervention for people in the first six months post‐stroke after discharge from formal rehabilitation. This adaptive intervention will include two intervention components: Structured Exercise and Lifestyle PA to increase physical activity, in addition to combinations of these treatment types. The objective of this SMART is to construct an adaptive intervention that will subsequently be evaluated against treatment‐as‐usual using a standard two‐arm trial design. This SMART will determine the optimum sequence of embedded treatments to improve physical activity at 3‐month follow‐up. Methods Design This trial will follow a SMART design (insert Figure of SAMRT design here). Participants will be randomized into one of two programme components; Structured Exercise or Lifestyle PA. At week 6, participants will be classified as either responders or non‐responders according to their step count. Participants classified as responders will continue in their respective groups until the end of the trial. Participants classified as non‐responders will be re‐randomised to alternative treatment options for the second 6 weeks. Defining responders and non‐responders Classification of participants as responders or non‐responders will be based on participants' 7‐day mean step count at week six compared to their baseline 7‐day mean step count. A relative improvement of at least 20% of each participant's baseline step count will determine them as a responder. For example, if a participant demonstrates a baseline mean steps/day of 3000 steps, an improvement of less than 600 mean steps/day will classify them as a non‐responder. There is limited evidence available regarding anticipated improvements in step count in this population (Lynch et al., 2018). A relative improvement of at least 20% was chosen based on data from a feasibility trial of a smartphone‐delivered, PA intervention for people with mild‐to‐moderate stroke living in the community (Paul et al., 2016). At the end of the intervention the experimental group has increased their average daily step count by 39.3% (4158 to 5791 steps/day). Taking a conservative approach, the cut‐off for non‐responders was set at approximately half of this or 20% in the current SMART. Randomisation All participants will be randomised at baseline to either the Structured Exercise or Lifestyle PA groups. A simple equal allocation randomisation at the individual level using a computer‐generated randomised list will be used. This will be concealed from the researchers involved in trial enrolment by using a centralised online service. At 6 weeks non‐responders will be re‐randomised following the same procedure. Eligibility criteria Participants will be included if they meet the following criteria: Inclusion criteria Age: 18 years+; Clinician‐confirmed stroke‐ ischaemic or haemorrhagic subtype; Living within 90km of University; Person in the first 6 months post‐stroke; No longer receiving inpatient or outpatient or community‐based physical activity rehabilitation modified Rankin Scale score of 0‐3; People post‐stroke who are able to express their basic needs verbally; Have access to relevant technology to enable mHealth intervention delivery; Have cognitive capacity to provide informed consent; Medical clearance for participation in the TAPAS programme. Exclusion criteria: Contraindications for undertaking physical activity e.g. safety, presence of unstable heart disease. Procedure Participants will be onboarded to the trial in an in‐person meeting. This will be in a location that suits the participant, for example, their home, a local community centre. In the onboarding session participants will be given a Fitbit Charge 4 and a tutorial on how to use it. They will be asked to wear the Fitbit for the remainder of the trial. The participants will be shown how to log into the online platform and provided with video and written instructions on its use. Participants will be randomised to receive either the Structured Exercise or Lifestyle Physical Activity components of the intervention when they log into the platform. After six weeks all participants will be classified as responders or non‐responders. This classification will be based on participants' 7‐day mean step count at week 6 compared to their baseline 7‐day mean step count. A relative improvement of at least 20% of each participant's baseline step count will determine them as a responder. Responders will continue in their respective groups until the end of the trial. Participants classified as non‐responders will be re‐randomised to alternative treatment options for the second 6 weeks. All participants will complete demographic and clinical self‐report questionnaires at baseline, 12 weeks and three month follow up. Primary outcome data (step count) will be collected by the Fitbit Charge 4. Intervention There are two components which target increased PA in the current intervention: Structured Exercise and Lifestyle PA. The SMART will determine what sequence and/or combination of these intervention components produces the greatest increase in physical activity as measured by average daily step count. Individualised baseline and continuous step count data for participants will be used to assign step activity goals. It is important to note that goals are set not based on an absolute number for all subjects, but rather individually, based on their own baseline walking. Goals are advanced based on subject achievement of previous goals. All participants will be assigned a new step count goal each week calculated by adding 5% to the 7‐ day average from their previous week. The choice of 5% weekly increments in step count targets is based on feasible step count goals used in previous trials among ambulatory people with stroke (Paul et al 2016, Danks et al 2016, Wright et al 2018). All participants will receive weekly phone calls from the TAPAS postdoctoral researcher. Structured Exercise Participants assigned to Structured Exercise will be provided with twice weekly strengthening exercise classes, delivered through the digital platform. The exercise classes will follow a circuit class style, in order to target a moderate‐vigorous exercise intensity, in keeping with recent guidelines on secondary stroke prevention. Classes will gradually progress in intensity throughout the program. Classes will include a full body warm up followed by a circuit of eight strengthening exercises completed for between one and three sets of 12 repetitions. Participants will be encouraged to exercise to fatigue on the 12th repetition of each set. This will be repeated for increasing sets and adding resistance through the use of resistance bands (which will be provided to the participants). Exercises will involve simple full body exercises and movements for each major muscle group; upper limb and lower limb. This will ensure that exercises that can be completed regardless of possible unilateral weakness or physical impairment. During each session, participants will be reminded to reach their targeted weekly step count goals. The structured exercise component is informed by international clinical guidelines (Kleindorfer et al 2021 and Billinger et al 2021). Lifestyle PA The Lifestyle PA component was developed using the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) Guide to Designing Interventions and is underpinned by the COM‐B model of behavior change (Michie et al., 2014). This posits that people need capability (C), opportunity (O), and motivation (M) to perform a behavior (B). The aim of the Lifestyle PA component is to increase the capability, opportunity, and motivation of participants to reach their daily step count goals. To achieve this the 3 stages of the BCW intervention design process were followed. The first stage, understanding the behaviour, is done through a review of the literature and primary qualitative research (Cardy et al., 2022). This stage identifies the change objectives of the intervention. Stage 2 requires the selection of intervention functions and the policies that would support them. Policy categories will not be selected for the lifestyle PA component of the TAPAS intervention as it is beyond the scope of this project. The final stage is defining the content of the intervention using behaviour change techniques (BCTs) and selecting their mode of delivery. A summary of this process is presented in Table A. A systematic review examining the study characteristics and the promise of interventions targeting free‐living PA and/or sedentary behaviour in people with stroke included nine RCTs (n=717)(Moore et al., 2018). The authors identified nine BCT's most likely to increase physical activity in people with stroke: action planning, goal setting (behaviour), credible source, social support (unspecified), problem solving, biofeedback, feedback on behaviour, information about health consequences, and information about social and environmental consequences. Seven of these have been included in the current intervention. Biofeedback was not included as it is beyond the scope of this digital health intervention and action planning was not included as participants are not required to define the context, frequency, duration and intensity of their step count increases. Following the BCW process and using the APEASE criteria (Michie et al., 2014) an additional ten BCTs were included in order to target each change objective identified in Stage 1 and intervention functions selected in Stage 2. Every week participants will be prompted to select from a range of strategies to help them to reach their step count goals, and will identify barriers and facilitators to the target behaviour in their weekly one‐to‐one phone calls with the TAPAS PDR. Participants will receive a mix of video/audio/graphical content to deliver selected BCT's and daily prompts and reward messages related to their step count goals. Outcomes Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, post‐intervention and 3‐month follow‐up. Outcome selection was informed by the most recent guidance on stroke rehabilitation and recovery outcome recommendations and an international standard set of patient‐centred stroke outcome measures (Kwakkel et al., 2017; Salinas et al., 2016). Primary outcome The primary outcome in this study is mean steps/day over 7 days measured using the Fitbit Charge 4 on the non‐paretic limb. Fitbit Charge 4 HR has been shown to feasibly measure step count with reasonable accuracy (Mean step count difference between step activity monitor and manual tally of ‐4.8 steps [‐1.8%]) among 15 people with recent mild stroke (Katzan et al 2021). Secondary outcomes Stroke recurrence (hospital records outlining re‐admission with clinician‐confirmed stroke recurrence) Sedentary behaviour using the section 5 of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) Fatigue using the 7‐item Fatigue Severity Scale Depression and anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Adverse effects, including death and falls rate Health‐related quality of life will be measured using the Stroke Specific Quality of Life scale. Utilities for the economic evaluation will be measured using the EQ‐5D‐5L index. Re‐integration into Normal Living Index Mobile Application Rating Scale: user version (uMARS; see appendix 1) Paragraph locked by Emma.Carr Feasibility outcomes Feasibility will be evaluated by process outcomes (recruitment rates), resource outcomes (retention and adherence rates) and management outcomes (processing time for enrolling participants, recruitment centre capacity). Acceptability of the intervention will be assessed by the uMARS (Mobile Application Rating Scale, user version). The uMARS is a validated measure used to evaluate the quality of health apps (Azad‐Khaneghah, Neubauer, Miguel Cruz, & Liu, 2020; Stoyanov et al., 2015). The uMARS consists of 23 items and uses a Likert scale to evaluate five domains: engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality, as well as an optional subjective quality scale. Fidelity outcomes Recruitment rates Recruitment centre capacity Processing time for enrolling participants Retention rates Adherence rates The US National Institute of Health Behaviour Change Consortium's fidelity framework proposes five fidelity dimensions: design, training, delivery, receipt and enactment (Bellg et al., 2004). Fidelity of intervention design concerns how comprehensively interventions are specified a priori and intervention acceptability (Bellg et al., 2004). The TAPAS intervention was based on primary qualitative research and has been reviewed by the TAPAS PPI panel. Throughout the intervention development process, multidisciplinary experts reviewed the intervention content to ensure clinical face validity and an evidence‐base approach. Both the TAPAS intervention delivery parameters (i.e. dose/ duration/ number of contacts) and content (i.e. component BCTs) have been specified a priori in detail. Fidelity of training refers to the extent to which intervention providers are competent and adequately trained to deliver interventions (Bellg et al., 2004). As the TAPAS intervention is digital there is only one component that requires intervention provider training: the phone calls in the lifestyle PA group. These phone calls will be scripted and recorded to assesses fidelity. Similarly, fidelity of delivery will be guaranteed, with the exception of the HCP phone calls, which will be scripted and recorded. In order to assess fidelity of receipt, website analytics will be used to determine if participants have watched assigned videos, completed required tasks and taken part in phone calls. Finally, fidelity of enactment will be assessed by participants' step count, as measured by the Fitbit charge 4. Recruitment There are two routes for recruitment. The first is through the following hospitals: University Hospital Limerick, Camillus' Community Hospital, Limerick, St Ita's Hospital, Limerick and University Hospital Galway. Gatekeepers at each hospital site will give the participant information leaflet to any stroke patients who have the appropriate medical clearance to participate in this study. Interested patients will use the contact details on the participant information leaflet to phone or email the TAPAS research team. The second recruitment route is through the networks of the Irish Heart Foundation (IHF). The IHF will disseminate the study participant information leaflet among all IHF clients via newsletters, weekly calls and Facebook group meetings. Interested individuals will use the contact details on the participant information leaflet to phone or email the TAPAS research team. Once a potential participant has made contact the TAPAS Postdoctoral researcher (PDR) will then discuss the trial with them and provide an opportunity to ask questions. The PDR will screen potential participants to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria. This will be done over the phone or using MS Teams. If a potential participant meets the inclusion criteria they will be sent an online informed consent form. Statistical Analysis The primary aim of the SMART is to determine which of the embedded adaptive interventions leads to the greatest improvement in PA at 3‐month follow‐up (Research Question 1). To address this we will compare the mean outcomes between the 4 embedded adaptive interventions (A+B, A+C, D+E and D+F). This will be done using regression analyses, adjusting for weighting and replication. Secondary objectives are to determine is it better to start with a 6 week Lifestyle PA intervention or a 6‐week Structured Exercise intervention at 3‐month follow‐up? (Research Question 2) and what is the best treatment option for non‐responders to stage 1 treatments at 3‐month follow‐up? (Research Question 3). To address these main treatment effects we will use standard longitudinal data analysis methods, such as linear mixed models. Consistent with the analysis of factorial experiments, the analysis of the two "main effect" aims will pool together different groups of participants from the multiple subgroups A‐F in Figure 1. For example, to answer "is it better to start with a 6 week Lifestyle PA intervention or a 6‐week Structured Exercise intervention?", we will compare change in PA (mean steps/day) from the beginning of the first‐stage treatment to the 3‐month follow‐up between all participants randomly assigned to initial Lifestyle PA treatment (subgroups D+E+F) versus all participants randomly assigned to initial Structured Exercise(subgroup A+B+C). A similar analysis approach will be used for the second main effect question. Sample size The sample size calculation relates to the primary objective of the SMART (to determine the optimum sequence of embedded treatments at 3‐month follow‐up). This sample size calculation is based on a continuous primary outcome; mean steps/day over 7 days. Based on a standardised effect size (0.35) and a probability of 0.80 of discovering the best adaptive intervention a sample size of 117 people with stroke is required (Almirall et al., 2014). This calculation assumes that the best and second best adaptive interventions differ by no smaller than an effect size of 0.35 (Almirall et al., 2014). To inform this sample size calculation, we have used effect size data on mean steps/day from the only available feasibility trial of a smartphone application for physical activity intervention among people with stroke (Paul et al., 2016). Paul et al. (2016) demonstrated an increase of 1,633 steps (SD: 2,550) for the mean number of steps/day (39%) increase relative to baseline in the smartphone application physical activity group after a 6‐ week intervention in community‐dwelling people post‐stroke. Sources of bias Sources of internal bias will be minimised by using robust methods to avoid selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting biases. We will minimise selection bias by using thorough randomisation and allocation concealment procedures. As this trial design does not include comparison with a control group we will minimise the potential for performance bias, as the participants will be blind to their group assignment. They will be informed, at time of consent that they will receive a series of treatments that are aimed to improve their PA levels over 12 weeks and that these treatments will depend on their own response to the treatment and progression throughout the programme. The intervention will be delivered remotely via the participants' own technology platform and the Fitbit Charge 4 provided. However, the TAPAS PDR will be aware of group allocation as he/she will offer support and demonstrations of the intervention throughout the trial. This may introduce an element performance bias due to the un‐blinding of personnel, however this is a common difficulty with rehabilitation or exercise trials wherein the intervention being delivered is clearly different to another, unlike in some drug trials. Detection bias will be minimised during the collection of data on outcome measures throughout the trial as the participants will be blind to group allocation and therefore the PDR sending and receiving paper‐based data collection forms (PDR in Statistics) will be blinded to outcome assessment. One advantage of using the SMART design is that non‐responders to a treatment will be switched to an alternate treatment‐ this may increase the likelihood of retaining participants in the trial and reducing attrition and incomplete outcome data. We will avoid any reporting bias by publishing the protocol prior to SMART completion and reporting complete data on all listed outcomes in the subsequent publication. Process evaluation The aim of the process evaluation is to to explore the experiences of key stakeholders participating in the SMART to inform the development and delivery of a future large scale definitive trial. A qualitative descriptive approach will be used (refs here) and findings will be reported in accordance with the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research checklist to ensure rigour (Supplemental File 1) (24). A sample of people with stroke who participated in the SMART will be invited to participate. The interview guides will focus on expectations, views and beliefs at being involved in the study, thoughts and beliefs on physical activity post‐stroke and subjective evaluation of the SMART content and delivery. Questions will also explore participants' views on considerations for a future full‐scale trial. Content analysis incorporating a framework analysis approach will be completed (familiarisation; identifying a thematic framework; indexing; charting & mapping and interpretation). NVivo will be used to check the accuracy of the themes. Executive summary statements will be developed as the foundation for drafting the findings that will be described and explain the active ingredients of the intervention from the perspective of the stakeholders. This will also serve to identify key issues which may need to be addressed in advance of a definitive RCT. Patient and public partnership statement A patient and public partnership panel was established including four people with stroke and patient advocate from the Irish Heart Foundation. The objectives of the panel are to contribute to 1) the development and design of the intervention, 2) the delivery of the trial, 3) the evaluation of the trial, and 4) dissemination of the trial findings. The panel has thus far contributed to Objective 1 by reviewing and providing feedback on the proposed content of the intervention and the usability of the digital interface and wearable. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Faculty of Education and Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee at the University of Limerick [Ref: XXXX]. The findings will be submitted for publication and presented at relevant national and international academic conferences.

N2  -  Background: 1‐2% of people in the developed world suffer from heart failure (HF), which costs the society around 100 billion USD per year. Although the improvements in treatment have lately decreased the number of hospitalizations and deaths due to HF, the burden still remains high with around half of the HF patients being expected to die within five years and HF being the most frequent cause of hospitalization in people aged over 65. Since there is no cure available at present, a better management of HF is crucial. A proper disease management may not only relieve symptoms, prevent hospitalization or improve survival, but may also affect the patient's health‐related quality of life (HRQoL). The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Task Force produced evidence‐based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of HF, intended to be used by clinical practitioners. Despite the availability of these guidelines, registry data consistently show an insufficient uptake in clinical practice. Of particular concern is the poor implementation of exercise guidelines, even though regular physical activity and structured exercise in CHF patients are strongly recommended. Nonetheless, participation rates of CHF patients in cardiac rehabilitation are generally below 20% in Europe. This calls for more specific recommendations on how to give lifestyle advice to patients in a personalized fashion. A promising technology for improving disease management in HF may be mobile health (mHealth), which encompasses the use of mobile devices as a support for the practice of medicine. mHealth has already been implemented to provide regular follow‐up and physiological monitoring, to ensure safety and detect complications in order to prevent subsequent health care utilization. In addition, it may also be a tool to deliver education and to support patients regarding self‐monitoring and self‐management. However, evidence on the effectiveness of this approach in HF patients has been mixed. Several meta‐analyses suggest clinical benefits, but large clinical trials did not show any effect on readmission or death. Nevertheless, the recent BEAT‐HF trial found that remote patient management did not reduce rehospitalization or mortality but reported instead an improvement in quality of life. Patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), such as HRQoL or perceived health status, have increasingly been recognized as outcomes of interest in HF and coronary patients in general. PROs are not surrogates for harder endpoints such as mortality, but rather represent independent outcomes with harder endpoints not necessarily reflecting of how a disease and its symptoms are experienced by the patient. Furthermore, HRQoL and health status have been shown to be predictive of clinical events in patients with HF. These findings show that patients' perceptions of worsening symptoms carry vital prognostic information, and should be implemented in trials evaluating disease management. An aspect that has been largely ignored in these types of trials concerning mHealth technology, is the psychological aspect that is necessary to start changing behavior and to cope with the symptoms of HF. Psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness exercises have already been shown to be successful in changing behavior and to significantly reduce anxiety, depression and symptoms which are common in HF patients. Therefore, implementing psychological interventions into mHealth technology may offer an added value to this tool. The HeartMan project aims to develop a personal health system to help HF patients managing their disease with the ultimate goal to improve HRQoL. In this system, HF patients are monitored not only focusing on their physical condition but also on the patient's psychological state. This information is integrated into a decision support system, using this information to both compute prognostic information based on predictive models, clinical care guidelines and expert knowledge and also to suggest the most appropriate intervention to modify and manage their lifestyle. Furthermore, these interventions are presented in a way adapted to the patient's psychological profile in order to increase the adherence to the medical device. Study design: HeartMan is a proof‐of‐concept randomized controlled 1:2 trial (RCT), being conducted at four hospitals in two countries (Belgium and Italy) to compare usual care in HF patients with the addition of a personal mHealth system on top of standard care. Sixty patients are enrolled in Italy and 60 in Belgium for a participation during six months, resulting in 40 patients in total in the control group and 80 in the intervention group. Ethical approval: This study has been approved by the ethical committees of the participating hospitals in both countries, with the ethical committee of the University Hospital in Ghent and Rieti General Hospital as the central ethical committees. Written informed consent is obtained from all participants prior to enrollment in the study. In addition, the HeartMan device which is used during the trial has been approved by the Federal Agency for Medicine and Health products in Belgium (FAGG: Federaal Agentschap voor Geneesmiddelen en Gezondheidsproducten) and Italy (AIFA: Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco). Sample size calculation: The sample size calculation was based on primary outcome data from the previous CHIRON project (ref), showing that 90 patients are needed to show at least 5.8 beats per min in average daily awake heart rate difference ‐ as a fundamental parameter correlating with patient‐reported HRQoL ‐ with 90% power between the two groups. Thus in order to account for possible drop‐outs, the trial is executed enrolling 60 patients in each of the two participating countries based on a 1:2 randomization protocol. Statistical analysis: The main analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints is based on the Intention To Treat principle, i.e. including all patients in the analysis who did not drop out within the first 4 weeks of the trial since these patients are replaced. In order to assess the clinical effect of the HeartMan intervention on the different outcomes (except for mortality and hospitalization), an additional per ‐ protocol analysis is performed in patients who adhere to the treatment plan for at least 50%. Based on these results, a dose‐response analysis is conducted to verify the relation between the level of adherence and intervention effects. Prior to each analysis, distribution of the variables is checked in order to choose the correct statistical test and outliers are identified. In all analyses, p values <0.05 are considered to be statistically significant. Effects of the proof‐of‐concept trial are assessed by analyzing baseline and end of investigation data between and among treatment groups. The primary endpoint of the HeartMan project is the self ‐ reported improvement in HRQoL which is analyzed using T‐ tests or it's non parametric variant and chi square tests to compare the characteristics between the groups. If necessary, a multiple linear regression approach is chosen to adjust for confounding variables. In order to assess the effect of the intervention among the different groups a repeated measures design with time*group interaction effect is chosen. A similar statistical approach is also performed for the secondary analyses. Secondary objectives within the HeartMan intervention are the effects on behavioural outcomes, illness perception and clinical outcomes which may ultimately have an impact on disease management and HRQoL. An objective parallel to the effect on HRQoL, is the impact of the HeartMan system on a combined endpoint of mortality and hospitalization. This objective is assessed by making a comparison of patient characteristics and the use of the HeartMan intervention between event‐free patients and those who had an event during the 6 months trial. Furthermore, a Kaplan meier analysis is performed to investigate event‐free survival. A great effort is made to have complete data on outcome measures and to use all obtained information. Early drop‐out within 4 weeks after starting the intervention is treated as actual drop‐out and replacement by novel candidates is foreseen. During the trial, the level of adherence is assessed and in case a low adherence is noticed (<50%), patients are actively contacted by a member of the research team in order to avoid drop ‐ out. For those who eventually drop out in a later phase, efforts will be made to perform the end of study examination and if this is not feasible, these will be considered as missing data. In the case of missing data, some of the outcome measures (e.g. heart rate or blood pressure) can be retrieved through data from the HeartMan system, using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) principle.

This objective is assessed by making a comparison of patient characteristics and the use of the HeartMan intervention between event‐free patients and those who had an event during the 6 months trial. Furthermore, a Kaplan Meier analysis is performed to investigate event‐free survival. Effects of the proof‐of‐concept trial are assessed by analyzing baseline and end of investigation data between and among treatment groups. The primary endpoint of the HeartMan project is the self‐reported improvement in HRQoL which is analyzed using T‐tests or it's non parametric variant and chi square tests to compare the characteristics between the groups. If necessary, a multiple linear regression approach is chosen to adjust for confounding variables. In order to assess the effect of the intervention among the different groups a repeated measures design with time*group interaction effect is chosen. A similar statistical approach is also performed for the secondary analyses. Secondary objectives within the HeartMan intervention are the effects on behavioral outcomes, illness perception and clinical outcomes which may ultimately have an impact on disease management and HRQoL. A great effort is made to have complete data on outcome measures and to use all obtained information. Early drop‐out within 4 weeks after starting the intervention is treated as actual drop‐out and replacement by novel candidates is foreseen. During the trial, the level of adherence is assessed and in case a low adherence is noticed (<50%), patients are actively contacted by a member of the research team in order to avoid drop‐out. For those who eventually drop out in a later phase, efforts will be made to perform the end of study examination and if this is not feasible, these will be considered as missing data. In the case of missing data, some of the outcome measures (e.g. heart rate or blood pressure) can be retrieved through data from the HeartMan system, using the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) principle.

N2  -  Purpose: The primary aim of this proposed pilot randomized controlled trial is to investigate the effectiveness and patterns of use of a mHealth application (ZoeInsights ‐ ZI) for supporting physical activity (PA) maintenance in remote and rural cancer survivors within an online‐delivered exercise oncology program (Project EXCEL; ethics HREBA‐CC.20‐0098). Background/Rationale: Evidence indicates mixed effectiveness for online‐delivered exercise oncology programs to improve physical activity (PA) behavior, especially with regards to maintenance of PA behavior post‐intervention. Supportive resources are needed, especially for remote/rural cancer survivors who may have lower social support, PA self‐efficacy, motivation, as well as unique barriers to PA. Mobile health technology (mHealth) has potential to support PA behavior change in cancer survivors, but evidence for its impact and best implementation practices in exercise oncology remains limited. Prior findings on PA behavior change suggest that in order to elicit lasting effects, early integration of supportive resources (eg. self‐monitoring via a mhealth app) within PA participation is important. And in particular, research is needed to determine the effectiveness of mHealth within exercise oncology programs for supporting long‐term PA maintenance. No studies on mhealth exercise interventions have been carried out in remote/rural cancer survivors. Objectives: Primary aim is to assess the effectiveness of the mhealth app, ZI for supporting maintenance of PA behavior change, up to 24‐weeks from program initiation. The impact of the ZI intervention on PA behaviour change will be measured by weekly objectively measured minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), subjectively reported weekly minutes of MVPA, and program attendance. The investigators hypothesize the ZI intervention group will have improved maintenance of PA behavior change at 24‐weeks compared to those in EXCEL only group. The secondary outcomes aim to assess the extent of use of the application. This will be assessed by app usage, satisfaction reports, and the participants perspectives on the continued use of the ZI application. The investigators hypothesize that majority of users will download and continue to use the application throughout the 24‐week study period. Methods: Participants and Recruitment All EXCEL participants will be eligible to participate in the proposed sub‐study, including those who may already be using PA‐related apps. Email invitations will be sent to eligible participants with a study overview, instructions on who to contact to answer questions, and a link to complete the informed consent form in the EXCEL RedCap database if they are interested in participating. The consent form will require an electronic signature. It will be marked as complete in RedCap as soon as all required fields are completed and the participant submits the form. After completion of recruitment, randomization using a random number generator, with odd numbers assigned to the intervention (EXCEL + ZI at baseline) and even numbers to the waitlist control (EXCEL + ZI at 24 weeks) group. Randomization will occur by clusters so that all participants in the same exercise class day and time will be assigned to the intervention or waitlist control group. This will be done to enhance the integration of ZoeInsights within the EXCEL program. To participate in EXCEL, participants must 1) have a cancer diagnosis; 2) be over the age of 18 years; 3) be able to participate in mild levels of activity as a minimum (to be assessed during screening via the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire); 4) be pre‐treatment, or receiving active cancer treatment, or have received cancer treatment within the past three years; 5) be able to provide informed written consent in English; and 6) have access to internet service that can support video calling. All EXCEL participants live in rural or remote locations in Canada. The inclusion criteria ensures the investigators reach a wide range of cancer survivors throughout various stages of their journey while ensuring they are physically capable of safely completing exercise. Participants will be eligible regardless of cancer type and stage and there are no aims to recruit specific cancer survivors. No stratification for treatment status will occur. Study Design/Procedure The proposed study will be a prospective, 2‐arm, pilot randomized controlled trial with waitlist control arm. Participants randomized to the intervention will receive access to the ZI application for the duration of the study. Those in the waitlist control group will be able to download and use ZI after completing the 24‐week assessment. All participants will take part in the standard 12‐week group‐based EXCEL online exercise program. Garmin wearable PA trackers will be provided to all participants to objectively track PA habits throughout the intervention. Intervention The ZI App: ZI is designed to promote PA behavior change and maintenance via self‐monitoring of physical activity, symptoms, and other health data. Furthermore, self‐monitoring is intended to facilitate participant understanding of and communication about their PA and health with caregivers, exercise professionals, and healthcare professionals. Additional information for using ZI will be provided via a PDF‐based user guide on installing and using the application, a live instructional webinar hosted by ZI developer Hanalytics Solutions, and access to continued support via email/telephone communication with study staff as well as Hanalytics Solutions. After completing initial set‐up, participants will be asked to record physical activity and symptoms regularly via scheduled in‐app routines. Reminders to complete these self‐monitoring tasks will be provided using daily push notifications scheduled according to participant preferences. Automatic graphs will be generated and displayed within the app to allow participants to visualize trends in physical activity, symptoms, and other health data. Further use of ZI (eg. Custom daily routines, additional graphing, medication tracking, accessing linked health resources) during the intervention will be possible ad libitum. ZI can be accessed via a web browser on any device that is connected to the internet (e.g. computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone), or via a native android or iOS mobile application on a smartphone or tablet. No devices will be provided to participants, as participants are already required to own an internet‐connected device for email communication and completion of study measures online in RedCap. The EXCEL online exercise program: The EXCEL exercise program is based on the Alberta Cancer Exercise (ACE) program (HREBA.CC‐16‐0905), adapted as required for rural/remote site implementation. The exercise program includes a combination of aerobic, resistance, balance, and flexibility exercises delivered in a circuit‐type class setting or group personal training format, twice weekly for a 8‐12 week period. The exercise sessions will be conducted online in small groups of 8‐15 participants under the direct supervision of a trained qualified exercise professional (QEP). The sessions will be conducted over the Zoom platform and the QEP will be provided additional support from the central research team, including moderators for sessions. The exercises will be slightly modified to ensure safety of all participants is maintained, based on current ACE online delivery. The program follows exercise progression principles (ie, principles of frequency, intensity, time, type, overload and progression) over the 8‐12‐weeks, with tailoring of any exercise to meet individual participant needs as required, in order to promote fitness and wellness benefits. Timing Participants will complete the baseline assessment, including EXCEL and sub‐study‐specific questionnaires and baseline physical function assessment, prior to EXCEL class start (T0). They will then be given access, within the first two weeks of EXCEL, to the ZI application along with the ZI user guide and invitation to the instructional webinar to facilitate installation, set‐up, and familiarization with ZI. Upon program start, participants will attend twice‐weekly group‐based EXCEL exercise classes and use ZI as outlined above to self‐monitor PA and health. The study will consist of 2 phases, the intervention phase (EXCEL classes + ZI) from week 0‐12, followed by the maintenance phase from weeks 12‐24 (ZI only). Outcome measures will be collected at 3 subsequent time points: week 4 (T1), week 12 (T2), and week 24 (T3). Measures Demographics (T0) Participant demographics will be collected within EXCEL. Additionally, participants will be asked to complete a set of questionnaires to assess prior technology usage, familiarity, and literacy. Physical Activity (T0‐T3) To examine effectiveness of ZI to support PA habits and maintenance, PA will be assessed via self‐report at all time points (T0‐T3) using the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ) and objectively throughout the intervention using the accelerometer (continued reporting of objective PA via Garmin after T2 is optional). In addition, class attendance (weeks 1‐12) will be recorded. Patterns of ZI use (T1‐T3) App usage data will be collected directly via ZI, including logins, tasks completed, pages visited, additional use, and continued usage habits during the maintenance phase. User satisfaction with ZI as well as usability will be assessed using the validated mobile app usability questionnaire (MAUQ). Additional data collected includes error reporting/technical difficulties and costs of providing ZI per participant (subscription fee and support hours required). Participant perceptions of using the ZI application will be examined via qualitative semi‐structured interviews. Qualitative Interviews (T2‐T3) A purposive sample of participants from the intervention group (n=10‐20) will be invited to participate in semi‐structured one‐on‐one interviews at 12 and 24 weeks. Interviews will focus on participant perspectives of using the ZI app as well as its usefulness for supporting PA behavior change and maintenance. An interview guide was developed by researchers with open‐ended questions that are designed to guide the discussion while allowing the participant voice to dictate the flow of their interview. Purposive sampling will be used to ensure that participants from various demographic backgrounds are represented, giving consideration to age, gender, cancer diagnosis (type, stage, time since diagnosis), and baseline technology use. EXCEL Study Measures (T0, T2, T3) As part of the EXCEL study, participants will complete a online physical function assessment with a clinical exercise physiologist (CEP). The CEP will assess resting health measures (heart rate, blood pressure, height, weight) as well as measures of flexibility, strength, and endurance via standardized tests. EXCEL participants will also complete questionnaires assessing symptom burden (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy ‐ General and Cognitive subscales), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy ‐ Fatigue subscale), and exercise barriers and facilitators (Exercise Barriers and Facilitators questionnaire developed for ACE). Sample Size The sample size calculation is based on the primary outcome of assessing intervention effectiveness for supporting PA maintenance. A total sample of 140 (70 per group) provides at least 80% power to detect a between‐group difference in PA of 60 minutes per week (including any PA from mild housework to strenuous training) with a two‐tailed alpha of 5%, allowing for 10% attrition over the intervention period. The investigators do not anticipate that the second wave of EXCEL (Winter 2020) will recruit more than 60‐80 participants, thus the investigators will collect data over at least two waves. Preliminary analyses on feasibility, and any changes required, would be made at the end of Spring 2021 session (i.e., July 2021), and put into place for Fall 2021 participants. Data Analysis Participant baseline characteristics and patterns of use will be summarized using descriptive statistics. To investigate within and between‐group differences at all time points, random effects linear mixed models will be used. The models will be controlled for potential demographic confounders (age, gender, cancer type, treatment status, and others). Primary analyses will follow intention‐to‐treat principles, with exploratory subgroup analyses based on actual ZI usage (i.e. completion of routines and other self‐monitoring). Qualitative interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analyzed according to interpretive description methodology based on a constructivist philosophy.

N2  -  1. Purpose/Specific Aims The overarching aim of this study is to provide a mechanism for patients to engage in progressive motor practice for a meaningful time period. The investigator's aim to improve on the positive outcomes demonstrated in patients in the chronic phase and the pilot work being done on patients in the acute in‐patient phase post stroke to determine whether functional recovery can be further improved using a home based system. Aim 1: Evaluate compliance with Home‐Telerehabilitation simulated hand/arm gaming activities and two computer game groups, one with motivation enhanced: Home Training Motivation Enhanced (HTme) simulations and one with non‐enhanced simulations: Home Training Unenhanced (HTu) versions. Hypothesis: Participants in the HTme group will show significant compliance as compared to the control group (HTu). Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of motivation enhanced HTme home‐based virtually simulated hand/arm gaming activities for individuals with stroke as compared to a program unenhanced HTu versions of the same simulations. Hypothesis: Participants completing HTme training will exhibit significantly improved clinical, kinematic and neurophysiological outcomes as compared to the control group (HTu). Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of the motivation enhancements designed into computer games to provide a more enjoyable training experience. Hypothesis: Enjoyment of the games will be a more valid predictor of compliance than personal factors. 2. Background and Significance Studies have shown that sustained hand rehabilitation training is important for continuous improvement and maintenance of function following a stroke. It is unimaginably difficult to pursue education, employment and community participation without being able to independently use one's hands. The primary goal of this study is to test an exciting new technology that can be easily used in the home for long‐term hand and upper extremity training. Recovery of hand function post brain injury is particularly recalcitrant to currently available interventions. To date, the best efforts of groups studying traditionally presented as well as technology‐based therapeutic interventions for the hemiplegic hand and arm have produced measurable changes in motor function and motor control but fall far short of major reductions in disability. If the amount of therapy is critical to rehabilitation, our current institutional limitations undermine the probabilities for successful outcomes. After discharge from the inpatient stay, access to rehabilitation therapy can be difficult for some patients. This is due in part to inadequate insurance, lack of transportation, and the patient's dependence on their caregiver. Having access to long‐term rehabilitation training anywhere and at any time is necessary for sub‐acute and chronic patients to continuously improve their functional abilities. 7. Reporting Results 7.1 Individual Results No disease screening data will be collected. Patient's changes on clinical tests will be shared with them during testing sessions. These sessions are conducted by licensed Physical Therapists who have training to help persons with stroke interpret clinical examination findings. 7.2 Aggregate Results Subjects will not be informed of aggregate findings. 7.3 Professional Reporting De‐identified, aggregate findings will be published in professional journals and presented at scientific meetings. 3. Research Design and Methods This study will be a single blind randomized controlled trial. Subjects will be blinded to the purpose of the study. All outcome measures will be performed by a therapist blinded to group assignment. A controlled trial will be utilized to determine the additive effect of presenting rehabilitation activities in a virtual environment as compared to standard upper extremity exercise. The investigators will randomize subjects to treatment and control groups using a computerized random number generator. 3.1. Duration of Study Each subject will perform a pre‐study evaluation, train using one of the protocols for three months, perform a post study evaluation as well as one and six month retention evaluations. 3.2 Study Sites Testing and initial training will take place in the Bergen Building of the Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences Campus in Newark. Home training will take place in subjects' homes. 3.3 Sample Size Justification The investigators will seek sufficient power to detect a clinically significant difference in the Wolf score changes in these two pre‐planned, primary comparisons. To evaluate these effects of training, we will assume a power level of .8 and a significance level of 0.05. With presumed correlation among repeated measures of 0.1 and effect size of 0.3, a sample size of 25 subjects in each of the two groups (HTme and HTu) to observe a significant effect for the first comparison (G*Power, version 3.1.5) is necessary. Although the investigators will screen for patients with homogeneous impairments, by its nature stroke is an extremely variable condition. Due to possible subject attrition, the investigators will use a total of 30 subjects in each of the two groups. 3.4 Subject Recruitment Subjects will be recruited through flyers, stroke support groups, and clinician referrals. The investigators will assume that approximately 15‐20% of the population will satisfy our inclusion criteria based on our previous experience with upper extremity rehabilitation in this population. Hence the investigators will approach 300 persons. 3.5 Consent Procedures Example: The study will be explained to the potential subject by the study staff, the consent will be read, and their questions will be answered. If participants wish to enroll, the subject will sign the consent form. The study staff obtaining consent will also sign and date the consent form, and a copy will be given to the subject sought from each prospective subject or the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with federal & state law and institutional policy. If the study staff member performing the consent process identifies issues suggesting that the prospective subject may not be capable of participating in the consent process due to dementia, a Folstein Mini Mental Status will be performed. Prospective subjects screening positive for dementia will not be included in the study. 3.5.1 Subject Costs and Compensation There are no costs for the subjects. The subjects will be paid 100$ at each of the retention tests. 4. Study Variables 4.1 Independent Variables or Interventions The two computer game groups, Motivation Enhanced (HTme) and Motivation Non‐Enhanced (HTu) will use the NJIT‐ Home Virtual Rehabilitation System (HoVRS) to play a series of computer games developed to practice movement of the hand and fingers. Subjects will first come into our lab, perform pre‐tests as well as a pre‐intervention training session. Then a physical therapist and engineer will set up the apparatus in subject's home and will train them on how to use the system and play the games in their home during the first week. The physical therapist and engineer will be in contact with subjects throughout the training and will visit subjects' homes as needed if problems are encountered. Additionally, the system allows the therapist to remotely monitor each day's activity. 4.1.1 Device Description NJIT HoVRS has two sub‐systems to deliver home‐based training: 1) a patient based platform to provide the training and 2) a server based online data logging and reporting system. In the patient's home, a cross platform virtual reality training application runs video games (developed in the Unity 3D game engine using the language C#) on their home computer. 4.1.11 Hardware The Leap Motion Controller (LMC) a commercially developed infrared tracking device developed for home video game control is used to capture motion of the hand and arm movement without requiring wearable sensors. The device's USB controller reads the sensor data into its own local memory and performs any necessary resolution adjustments. This data is then streamed via USB to the Leap Motion image Application Programming Interface (API). From there, we programmed the system to feed tracking data into virtual reality activities by calling the Leap Motion API. If the patient's arm is weak and cannot support the hand against gravity above the Leap Motion Controller, a commercially available, spring‐based arm support, will be provided to the subject (Figure 1). The arm support provides 12 different levels of passive support allowing it to accommodate a wide range of patient sizes and strength levels. It requires a single setting that can be provided during the patient's initial evaluation 4.1.1.2 Software Patients will either use their own home computer or will be provided with a computer if needed. A user‐friendly Graphic User Interface (GUI) lists all of the training activities allowing patients to choose which activity they want to begin with using just one mouse click. Currently twelve games have been developed, each one designed to focus on training a specific hand or arm movement such as wrist rotation or finger individuation. All games are downloadable via HoVRS website. 4.2 Dependent Variables: See Outcomes Measures 4.3 Risk of Harm There is less than minimal risk involved. The virtual reality (VR) experiments are non‐invasive and pose no obvious risk. Transient fatigue of the hand and arm are possible, but this risk is not greater than that posed by normal daily activities following a stroke. 4.4 Potential for Benefit The benefits of taking part in this study may be: Patient may regain better use of their hand and arm. However, it is possible that patients might receive no direct personal benefit from taking part in this study. 5. Data Handling and Statistical Analysis All efforts will be made to keep subjects' personal information confidential. All subject names will be removed from the data and the data will be tagged using a coded identification (ID) number. Demographic, clinical outcome and survey data will first be recorded on paper. All kinematic and computerized performance data will be collected on computer. These computer files will be identified by the coded subject ID number. All data will be transferred to an Excel spreadsheet with subjects identified by this same ID number. Spreadsheets will be stored on a drive that is password protected. Data will only be accessible to study staff and will be retained for seven years. The link between subject identity and subject ID number will be destroyed when data collection is completed. The primary outcome measures and all secondary outcome measures described above will be subjected to a repeated measured analysis of variance, with between‐group factors Therapy Type (HTme, HTu) and within‐group factor Test (Before, Post, One Month retention, Six Months Retention). Post‐hoc analyses of the Therapy Type by Test interaction effects will focus on the Month 1 versus Month 6 comparison. The investigators will be quantifying training effects by comparing group means as well as by percent change in performance, and by comparing the recovery curves obtained from Tests 1‐4. All clinical outcomes used are well established measures of upper extremity functional recovery with published minimum clinically important differences which will be used to evaluate the significance of our findings.

N2  -  1. Background and Rationale Insomnia is estimated to be the most prevalent sleep disorder, with nearly 10% of the general population meeting diagnostic criteria. Extensive work is still being deployed to better delineate the multiple subtypes of insomnia, and major gains are to be made using multi‐domain physiological monitoring to deepen our understanding of this heterogeneous disease. Some individuals with insomnia show low levels of slow wave sleep (SWS). Novel devices which can be used in the field over multiple days now enable longer term monitoring of EEG features such as sleep slow waves to assess not only inter‐individual variability, but also intra‐individual variability, a phenomenon of high importance to assess the stability of slow wave abnormalities in insomnia subtypes. Recent findings show that carefully timed auditory stimulation can increase sleep slow waves. Whether such auditory stimulation can potentiate slow waves in people with insomnia symptoms remains to be tested. Furthermore, sleep architecture and quantitative EEG measures undergo significant alterations in many people with insomnia. Insomnia is notably linked to prolonged sleep onset latency, short total sleep time, numerous nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency and low amounts of SWS. For instance, it is estimated that people with chronic insomnia spend 20 minutes less in SWS per night compared to good sleepers. Individuals with insomnia have also been reported to have less slow wave activity (SWA; lower spectral power in the delta frequency range), with a shift towards elevated high frequency EEG activity, a potential physiological marker of increased cortical arousal. SWS and SWA are thought to be reflective of sleep depth and to play a central role in sleep maintenance and restorative sleep functions. SWS/SWA alteration may thus represent one of the factors contributing to the lower awakening threshold of people with insomnia and to some of their daytime symptoms, including cognitive difficulties and significant daytime fatigue. Of note, it has been proposed that SWS abnormalities in insomnia may result in part from dysfunctions in thermoregulatory processes, especially around sleep onset. Autonomic alterations are also visible through elevated heart rate and abnormally low heart rate variability in people with insomnia. Yet very little is known about how daily changes in body temperature and heart rate are related to SWS/SWA dynamics in people with insomnia. There is thus a need for simultaneous ambulatory monitoring across potentially interacting physiological systems. Enhancement of Slow Oscillations Recent studies demonstrated that slow oscillations (SO), a SWA component in lower frequencies (<1Hz), can also be increased with auditory stimulation. For instance, 50ms pink noise pulses administered during SWS, specifically during the ascending phase of the SO detected in the frontal cortex, increased SO activity. The ascending phase of the SO reflects the depolarization of the cell membrane and increased excitability of the neural network. Further studies confirmed these findings, notably reporting that this may translate across the SWA spectrum. EEG headbands are ambulatory devices for EEG recording capable of stimulation that is phase‐locked to SOs. A recent double‐blind randomized sham‐controlled study using a beta version of these devices in health adults reported a 0.70 specificity and 0.90 sensitivity to automatically detect N3 sleep (as compared to expert human scoring) and rather effective real‐time closed‐loop detection and stimulation in the SO ascending phase. This yielded an 11‐43% increase in spectral power within the delta frequency band during the 4 seconds following stimulations. Importantly, this effect persisted over a sustained period of 10 consecutive nights of stimulation, suggesting no major sign of desensitization over this period. Whether such auditory stimulation can also potentiate slow waves in people with insomnia symptoms remains to be tested. Potential Modulators of Insomnia Symptoms and Slow wave sleep Insomnia is not a homogeneous syndrome and can be characterized by a range of different physiological and psychological profiles. For instance, evidence suggests that people with insomnia who underestimate their sleep durations ("subjective" insomnia subtype) have more SWA reductions than those with objective short sleep durations ("objective" insomnia subtype). In addition, SWS potentiation may not have noticeable impacts in individuals with insomnia with more prominent sleep initiation difficulties (initial insomnia), and there may be little effects to those with early morning awakenings (terminal insomnia) since SWS occurs mostly in the first portion of the night. Importantly, there are indications that the symptomatic profiles defining some of these insomnia subtypes may vary across time. While this type of work was mostly based on subjective self‐reported measures, few studies have reported data about the stability of objective sleep EEG and other physiological features across insomnia subtypes, reporting relative short term stability but possible inter‐subtype variability. This limits our understanding of the multiple pathophysiological factors involved in the maintenance of insomnia, with central implications for the daily management of this chronic illness. New wearable technologies are creating an unprecedented opportunity to fill in this knowledge gap. Slow Oscillations in Insomnia and Comorbid Mental Disorders Insomnia is highly comorbid with mental disorders. In fact, studies have found that those suffering from sleep disturbances are more psychologically aroused, perceive their lives as more stressful, and use emotion‐based coping strategies more than do good sleepers. Since there are reports of SWS/SWA dysregulation in people with depression or post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), there may be some interactions between these mental disorders and insomnia on these sleep EEG features. One common feature of insomnia, depression and PTSD is the deregulation of the stress system leading to increased autonomic activation. This is notably reflected by elevated blood pressure and heart rate, reduced heart rate variability, faster breathing rate, increased skin conductance and abnormal temperature regulation. Possible Benefits of Slow Oscillation Potentiation for Cognitive Functions SWS/SWA and SO are known to play an important role in cognition, notably in terms of memory functions. For instance, low SWS has been shown to disrupt memory consolidation. It has been shown that SWS enhancement during sleep can facilitate declarative memory consolidation. Considering the memory difficulties commonly reported by individuals with insomnia and the observed alterations in sleep‐related memory consolidation in this population, there is a need to investigate whether SO potentiation during sleep may impact daily cognitive performance in people with and without insomnia. 2. Study Objectives A) To better delineate profiles of insomnia subtypes in people with and without depression or PTSD across simultaneous EEG, heart rate, skin conductance, and body temperature monitoring over multiple days in the natural sleeping environment. B) To compare the influence of auditory stimulation on SO and related objective and subjective sleep measures, as well as mental well‐being, daytime fatigue, and cognitive performance in healthy sleepers and people with symptoms of insomnia (with and without psychiatric comorbidities). C) To run exploratory analyses to determine if individual SO sensitivity to sound stimulation during sleep relates to auditory event‐related potentials in the wake state. 3. Study Design 3.1 General Overview This study integrates 2 design frameworks: a) observational design (Aim A), and b) crossover design (Aims B and C). A crossover design was chosen to reduce the influence of confounding covariates because each participant serves as her/his own control. Optimal crossover designs are statistically efficient and require fewer participants than cross‐sectional designs. The overall protocol includes a web‐based screening interview and home‐based data collection spanning over 5 weeks. A subset of participants will be invited for in‐lab monitoring via 3 overnight visits. 3.2 Recruitment, initial consent and screening Participants will be recruited from 3 sites: The Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (ROMHC), the Insomnia Clinic of the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, and the CERVO Brain Research Centre. Recruitment will also be achieved through institutional 'Permission to contact" registries, as well as through external recruitment with advertisements distributed via web‐based platforms (e.g., institutional websites (e.g. www.theroyal.ca), sleeponitcanada.ca, the eMentalHealth Research Study Directory (www.ementalhealth.ca), related web Kijiji, Facebook and twitter). 3.2.1 Contact pathways: A. "Clinician referral" pathway Clinicians from any of the study sites identify patients they would like to refer to the study, get the patients to fill out the institution‐specific "Permission to be contacted form", and send this form to the research team. B. "Consent to be contacted" pathway ROMHC programs and external collaborators have an existing list of people who consented to be contacted for research. These individuals will be contacted by the research team by phone or email. C. "Direct contact" pathway Potential participants reach out directly to the research team after seeing advertisements or hearing about the study by word of mouth. For all pathways, these procedures will be followed: 1. A research assistant will contact potential participants by email to send them a summary of the study and a link to complete an anonymous online screening form for the first set of eligibility criteria on a secured web platform (Qualtrics, www.qualtrics.com; license held via the University of Ottawa) and a unique identification code. The first question of this online form will be asking participants to confirm they consent to take part to the screening process. This will be documented in the screening database. The second question of this online screening form will ask participants to insert their unique anonymous research code. This screening form will include the WHO‐ASSIST item 2, Sleep Disorders Symptoms Checklist‐25, Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI), Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC‐PTSD), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ‐9) and should take between 10 and 15 minutes to complete. 2. If the questionnaires indicate that the first set of eligibility criteria are met, the participant will be invited for the second and last screening step: a screening phone interview (based on the M.I.N.I. without the suicidality module). This interview should last for about 15‐45 minutes. Before the start of the interview, the research assistant will confirm verbal consent to pursue the screening process. This will also be documented in the screening database. If the potential participant does not meet the last set of eligibility criteria assessed via the phone interview, the study will be terminated. 3.2.2 Ongoing Consent Procedure For participants found to be eligible after the screening phone interview, the research assistant will summarize the next steps of the study verbally and address any questions or concerns that participants may have at the end of the phone interview. Special care will be given to ensure that participants understand that their participation is entirely voluntary and that they can withdraw from the study at any stage (without any consequence on the treatment(s) they receive at the specific study site or their relationship with any of the clinicians at that study site). Eligible participants will be sent an electronic form containing the information and consent form (ICF) and will have as much time as they need to read it at home before enrolling in the study. As part of that same electronic form, they will confirm consent by ticking consent boxes and entering their full name. This information will be stored in a consent database showing the participant's full name and consent date, which will be kept on restricted access folders on the ROMHC's server in separate files than the research data. This online consent form was created based on published guidelines from peer‐reviewed articles. Ongoing consent will also be obtained electronically at the follow‐up time points. 3.3 Data collection and management 4.3.1. Baseline assessment At the end of the screening interview and after obtaining verbal consent to enroll in the study, eligible participants will be asked additional questions about the course of their mental disorders, including age at onset and duration of longest episode (inspired from the Diagnostic interview for genetic studies), as well as the proportion of time with PTSD and/or depressive symptoms over the past 1, 5 and 10 years. Participants will be given a package with the equipment to start ambulatory measurements. Until the pandemic situation resolves, participants will have the option to come to the ROMHC for curbside pick‐up in strict conditions respecting physical distancing (i.e. both participant and staff will be masked, staff will put the package directly in the trunk without coming in close contact with the participant) or to get a courier delivery with all mail and mail back costs covered by the research team. The Royal Logo or name will not appear on the package. Participants will complete 1 week of monitoring at home using the EEG headband device (DREEM2, Dreem, Paris, France; used for monitoring purpose only, no stimulation at baseline), an elastic chest belt to measure heart rate (Zephyr Bioharness), and a small sensor fixed on the abdomen using hypo‐allergic tape to monitor skin temperature (i‐button). During this period, participants will fill a sleep log (containing the core elements of the ''Consensus Sleep Diary''). Participants will be instructed on how to use this equipment on brief pre‐recorded online videos. They will be asked to liaise with the research team if they have any questions. On the seventh (last) day of the ambulatory monitoring period, participants will also be asked to fill out a battery of questionnaires through a secure web‐based platform (Qualtrics) using an anonymous research code. This will take about 1 hour to complete and will inquire about general demographic and clinical information, sleep, daytime functioning, mental health (please see table 1). They will also complete a 40‐60 minute online neuropsychological battery (Cambridge Brain Sciences; https://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/science/tasks). They will also complete two 18‐minute resting state EEG recordings: i) 30 minutes before sleep on the evening of the seventh day, and ii) 30 minutes after waking up on the following morning. As part of the consent process, participants who are clients from the ROMHC, the Insomnia Clinic of the Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, or the CERVO Brain Research Centre will have the option of granting the research team access to their medical chart to document diagnostic information and data from their clinical sleep assessments (results from their questionnaires, overnight sleep study data, diagnoses and treatment plan) were available. 3.2.2. Experimental conditions All participants will take part in two experimental conditions separated by one week in a randomized order: seven days of ambulatory monitoring with auditory stimulation, seven days of ambulatory monitoring without auditory stimulation. Participants, care providers, and all researchers involved in data collection or processing will be blinded to the order of these experimental conditions. On the final day of each experimental condition and before the start of the second experimental condition, participants will be asked to fill out a subset of the online questionnaires about sleep, daytime functioning, and mental health which should take about 30 minutes to complete (please see table 1). They will also complete an alternate form of the online neuropsychological battery (Cambridge Brain Sciences) and a 10‐minute resting state EEG recording 30 minutes before their habitual bedtime and after their habitual wake times (to allow for the dissipation of morning sleep inertia). The randomization process will consist of a computer‐generated random listing of the two potential sequential orders of the experimental conditions, stratified by sex and diagnostic group. This will be managed by a research collaborator who will not have any contact with the study participants and who will not be directly involved in data processing. This research collaborator will label the placebo and active devices with the participant ID codes and order of use for blinded distribution. Since there are no potential risks for the active condition, we do not expect having to break the blinding codes in this study. In the active experimental condition, participants will complete 1 week of SO stimulation with the EEG headband monitor (DREEM2, Dreem, Paris, France) in the form of auditory stimuli (100ms pink noise pulses, i.e., below the waking threshold as established in prior work) sent on the ascending phase of the SO during N3 sleep. In the placebo condition, participants will complete 1 week of EEG headband monitoring without auditory stimulations. Characteristics and robustness of event‐related potentials triggered by the auditory stimulations during sleep will be collected, in addition to the spectral power in the SO and delta frequency ranges in the 4 seconds following the initial stimulation. 3.2.3 Follow‐up measures One week after the last experimental condition, participants will fill out questionnaires (10 to 20 minutes) to track potential changes in sleep and mental health (please see table 1). 3.2.4. In‐lab overnight recordings (when allowed by Public Health Directives) A subgroup of participants (n=40, 10 per group as defined in section 5) will be invited for 3 nights of in‐lab standard polysomnography. This will enable to compare the detection of N3 sleep by the ambulatory EEG headband with the gold standard of sleep measurements and to monitor the effects of the stimulation on more extensive brain regions than the ones covered by the ambulatory EEG headband. Prior to the optional overnight in‐lab recordings, participants will be asked not to refrain from: ‐ Taking any naps or drinking alcohol on the day of their visit ‐ Having coffee, tea, energy drinks Coke/Pepsi or chocolate (i.e. anything that contains caffeine) as of midday on the day of their visit ‐ Consuming any recreational drugs until the end of their last appointment The first night will be conducted at baseline and will serve as an adaptation night in order to get rid of the "first night effect". At the start of each experimental condition, the same subgroup will be re‐invited to the sleep laboratory for a night of standard polysomnography concurrent with active/placebo auditory stimulations delivered with the same device used in the experimental condition. For all these in lab visits, participants will arrive about 2 hours before habitual sleep time and leave about 45 minutes after their usual wake‐up time. In addition to the use of an EEG headband device (active or placebo depending on the experimental condition), electrodes will be placed on the scalp according to the 10‐20 system with: 11 scalp EEG channels (Fp1‐2, F3‐4, C3‐Z‐4, P3‐4, O1‐2), ground and reference channels, right and left EOG, 2 chin EMG and 2 ECG channels. On the first night only, to document the presence of sleep‐related respiratory disorders and periodic leg movements. Respiration will be monitored with an airflow cannula (pressure transducer), nasal‐oral thermistor, respiratory effort via thoracic and abdominal respiratory belts, and blood oxygen saturation via an oximeter probe on the finger. On the experimental nights (second and third nights), skin conductance will be continuously recorded using a monitor attached on the finger and body temperature will be monitored with five small sensors (i‐buttons) fixed on the skin with hypoallergenic sticky tape (located on the neck, hand, abdomen, thigh, and foot). Before and after the sleep episode, in the wake state, participants will undergo a 10‐minute resting state EEG recording and event‐related potentials (ERP) recordings. To characterise wake state brain responses to auditory stimuli similar to the stimuli used in the sleep experimental manipulation, ERP recordings will involve: i) a 20‐minute auditory oddball task using deviant stimuli with the same physical properties as the 100 ms pink noise used for sleep‐based SO potentiation, and ii) a 20‐minute Fast/Slow task with the same stimuli. The Fast/Slow paradigm counts two conditions, 1) long pink noise presented with fast inter‐stimuli intervals (ISI), 2) short pink noise presented with slow ISI. In this paradigm, the slower condition taps into frontal lobe functions while the fast condition does not, therefore enabling the assessment of frontal functions, a cortical region of high relevance for sleep slow waves. All tasks will involve the passive listening of sounds through headphones. Participants will then be asked to go to sleep and be woken up at their habitual wake times. Sleep stage scoring will be manually performed by sleep technologists in accordance with the clinical scoring guidelines established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. 3.2.3. Debriefing At the end of the last experimental condition, participants will be asked to fill out questionnaires about expectations surrounding the experimental conditions. Once this is completed, they will receive a debriefing email about the order of the two experimental conditions (sent by the research assistant responsible for randomization to keep other research staff blind).
