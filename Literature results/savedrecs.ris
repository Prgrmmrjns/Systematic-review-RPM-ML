AB  - Background: The World Health Organization has projected that by 2030, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be the third-leading cause of mortality and the seventh-leading cause of morbidity worldwide. Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) are associated with an accelerated decline in lung function, diminished quality of life, and higher mortality. Accurate early detection of acute exacerbations will enable early management and reduce mortality. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a prediction system using lifestyle data, environmental factors, and patient symptoms for the early detection of AECOPD in the upcoming 7 days. Methods: This prospective study was performed at National Taiwan University Hospital. Patients with COPD that did not have a pacemaker and were not pregnant were invited for enrollment. Data on lifestyle, temperature, humidity, and fine particulate matter were collected using wearable devices (Fitbit Versa), a home air quality-sensing device (EDIMAX Airbox), and a smartphone app. AECOPD episodes were evaluated via standardized questionnaires. With these input features, we evaluated the prediction performance of machine learning models, including random forest, decision trees, k-nearest neighbor, linear discriminant analysis, and adaptive boosting, and a deep neural network model. Results: The continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and indoor environment factors was implemented by integrating home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and wearable devices. All data from 67 COPD patients were collected prospectively during a mean 4-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 25 AECOPD episodes. For 7-day AECOPD prediction, the proposed AECOPD predictive model achieved an accuracy of 92.1%, sensitivity of 94%, and specificity of 90.4%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of the model in predicting AECOPD was greater than 0.9. The most important variables in the model were daily steps walked, stairs climbed, and daily distance moved. Conclusions: Using wearable devices, home air quality-sensing devices, a smartphone app, and supervised prediction algorithms, we achieved excellent power to predict whether a patient would experience AECOPD within the upcoming 7 days. The AECOPD prediction system provided an effective way to collect lifestyle and environmental data, and yielded reliable predictions of future AECOPD events. Compared with previous studies, we have comprehensively improved the performance of the AECOPD prediction model by adding objective lifestyle and environmental data. This model could yield more accurate prediction results for COPD patients than using only questionnaire data. (JMIRMhealth Uhealth 2021;9(5):e22591) doi: 10.2196/22591

AB  - Background: Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are associated with accelerated decline in lung function, diminished quality of life, and higher mortality. Proactively monitoring patients for early signs of an exacerbation and treating them early could prevent these outcomes. The emergence of affordable wearable technology allows for nearly continuous monitoring of heart rate and physical activity as well as recording of audio which can detect features such as coughing. These signals may be able to be used with predictive analytics to detect early exacerbations. Prior to full development, however, it is important to determine the feasibility of using wearable devices such as smartwatches to intensively monitor patients with COPD.
   Objective: We conducted a feasibility study to determine if patients with COPD would wear and maintain a smartwatch consistently and whether they would reliably collect and transmit sensor data.
   Methods: Patients with COPD were recruited from 3 hospitals and were provided with a smartwatch that recorded audio, heart rate, and accelerations. They were asked to wear and charge it daily for 90 days. They were also asked to complete a daily symptom diary. At the end of the study period, participants were asked what would motivate them to regularly use a wearable for monitoring of their COPD.
   Results: Of 28 patients enrolled, 16 participants completed the full 90 days. The average age of participants was 68.5 years, and 36% (10/28) were women. Survey, heart rate, and activity data were available for an average of 64.5, 65.1, and 60.2 days respectively. Technical issues caused heart rate and activity data to be unavailable for approximately 13 and 17 days, respectively. Feedback provided by participants indicated that they wanted to actively engage with the smartwatch and receive feedback about their activity, heart rate, and how to better manage their COPD.
   Conclusions: Some patients with COPD will wear and maintain smartwatches that passively monitor audio, heart rate, and physical activity, and wearables were able to reliably capture near-continuous patient data. Further work is necessary to increase acceptability and improve the patient experience.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between heart rate variability (HRV) and various phenotypic measures that relate to health and functional status in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and secondly, to demonstrate the feasibility of ascertaining HRV via a chest-worn wearable biosensor in COPD patients. HRV analysis was performed using SDNN (standard deviation of the mean of all normal R-R intervals), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and LF/HF ratio. We evaluated the associations between HRV and COPD severity, class of bronchodilator therapy prescribed, and patient reported outcomes. Seventy-nine participants with COPD were enrolled. There were no differences in SDNN, HF, and LF/HF ratio according to COPD severity. The SDNN in participants treated with concurrent beta-agonists and muscarinic antagonists was lower than that in other participants after adjusting heart rate (beta coefficient -3.980, p = 0.019). The SDNN was positively correlated with Veterans Specific Activity Questionnaire (VSAQ) score (r = 0.308, p = 0.006) and handgrip strength (r = 0.285, p = 0.011), and negatively correlated with dyspnea by modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) questionnaire (r = -0.234, p = 0.039), health status by Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (r = -0.298, p = 0.008), symptoms by COPD Assessment Test (CAT) (r = -0.280, p = 0.012), and BODE index (r = -0.269, p = 0.020). When measured by a chest-worn wearable device, reduced HRV was observed in COPD participants receiving inhaled beta-sympathomimetic agonist and muscarinic antagonists. HRV was also correlated with various health status and performance measures.

AB  - Health information technology is one of today's fastest-growing and most powerful technologies. This technology is used predominantly for predicting illness and obtaining medications quickly because visiting a doctor and performing pathological tests can be time-consuming and expensive. This has prompted many researchers to contribute by developing new disease prediction systems or improving existing ones. This paper presents a smartwatch-based prediction system named 'MedAi' for multiple diseases such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, respiratory disease, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, gallstones, diabetes, dyslipidemia using machine learning algorithms. It comprises three core modules: a prototype smartwatch 'Sense O'Clock' equipped with eleven sensors to collect bodily statistics, a machine learning model to analyze the data and make a prediction, and a mobile application to display the prediction result. A dataset consisting of patient bodily statistics was obtained from a local hospital according to ethical guidelines, such as obtaining the prior consent of both patients and doctors. We employ several machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Forest (RF) to investigate the best performing algorithm. Experimentation using our dataset shows that the RF algorithm outperforms other machine learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN, XGBoost, etc., in predicting aforementioned diseases with an accuracy of 99.4%. The system provides full-time assistance to the user by reporting his or her body condition and suggesting requisite remedies. It is a notable addition to early disease prediction systems and can predict multiple disease vulnerabilities before they reach an irrecoverable stage. Finally, we compare our method with the related existing methods.

AB  - This paper presents an integrated and scalable precision health service for health promotion and chronic disease prevention. Continuous real-time monitoring of lifestyle and environmental factors is implemented by integrating wearable devices, open environmental data, indoor air quality sensing devices, a location-based smartphone app, and an AI-assisted telecare platform. The AI-assisted telecare platform provided comprehensive insight into patients' clinical, lifestyle, and environmental data, and generated reliable predictions of future acute exacerbation events. All data from 1,667 patients were collected prospectively during a 24-month follow-up period, resulting in the detection of 386 abnormal episodes. Machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms were used to train modular chronic disease models. The modular chronic disease prediction models that have passed external validation include obesity, panic disorder, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with an average accuracy of 88.46%, a sensitivity of 75.6%, a specificity of 93.0%, and an F1 score of 79.8%. Compared with previous studies, we establish an effective way to collect lifestyle, life trajectory, and symptom records, as well as environmental factors, and improve the performance of the prediction model by adding objective comprehensive data and feature selection. Our results also demonstrate that lifestyle and environmental factors are highly correlated with patient health and have the potential to predict future abnormal events better than using only questionnaire data. Furthermore, we have constructed a cost-effective model that needs only a few features to support the prediction task, which is helpful for deploying real-world modular prediction models.

AB  - Recent advances in stroke treatment have provided effective tools to successfully treat ischemic stroke, but still a majority of patients are not treated due to late arrival to hospital. With modern stroke treatment, earlier arrival would greatly improve the overall treatment results. This prospective study was performed to asses the capability of bilateral accelerometers worn in bracelets 24/7 to detect unilateral arm paralysis, a hallmark symptom of stroke, early enough to receive treatment. Classical machine learning algorithms as well as state-of-the-art deep neural networks were evaluated on detection times between 15 min and 120 min. Motion data were collected using triaxial accelerometer bracelets worn on both arms for 24 h. Eighty-four stroke patients with unilateral arm motor impairment and 101 healthy subjects participated in the study. Accelerometer data were divided into data windows of different lengths and analyzed using multiple machine learning algorithms. The results show that all algorithms performed well in separating the two groups early enough to be clinically relevant, based on wrist-worn accelerometers. The two evaluated deep learning models, fully convolutional network and InceptionTime, performed better than the classical machine learning models with an AUC score between 0.947-0.957 on 15 min data windows and up to 0.993-0.994 on 120 min data windows. Window lengths longer than 90 min only marginally improved performance. The difference in performance between the deep learning models and the classical models was statistically significant according to a non-parametric Friedman test followed by a post-hoc Nemenyi test. Introduction of wearable stroke detection devices may dramatically increase the portion of stroke patients eligible for revascularization and shorten the time to treatment. Since the treatment effect is highly time-dependent, early stroke detection may dramatically improve stroke outcomes.

AB  - Surface electromyography signal plays an important role in hand function recovery training. In this paper, an IoT-enabled stroke rehabilitation system was introduced which was based on a smart wearable armband (SWA), machine learning (ML) algorithms, and a 3-D printed dexterous robot hand. User comfort is one of the key issues which should be addressed for wearable devices. The SWA was developed by integrating a low-power and tiny-sized IoT sensing device with textile electrodes, which can measure, pre-process, and wirelessly transmit bio-potential signals. By evenly distributing surface electrodes over user's forearm, drawbacks of classification accuracy poor performance can be mitigated. A new method was put forward to find the optimal feature set. ML algorithms were leveraged to analyze and discriminate features of different hand movements, and their performances were appraised by classification complexity estimating algorithms and principal components analysis. According to the verification results, all nine gestures can be successfully identified with an average accuracy up to 96.20%. In addition, a 3-D printed five-finger robot hand was implemented for hand rehabilitation training purpose. Correspondingly, user's hand movement intentions were extracted and converted into a series of commands which were used to drive motors assembled inside the dexterous robot hand. As a result, the dexterous robot hand can mimic the user's gesture in a real-time manner, which shows the proposed system can be used as a training tool to facilitate rehabilitation process for the patients after stroke.

AB  - Individuals with diabetes mellitus type 1 (DM1) tend to check their blood sugar levels multiple times daily and utilize this information to predict their future glycemic levels. Based on these predictions, patients decide on the best approach to regulate their glucose levels with considerations such as insulin dosage and other related factors. Nevertheless, modern developments in Internet of Things (IoT) technology and innovative biomedical sensors have enabled the constant gathering of glucose level data using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in addition to other biomedical signals. With the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, glycemic level patterns can be modeled, enabling accurate forecasting of this variable. Constrained devices have limited computational power, making it challenging to run complex machine learning algorithms directly on these devices. However, by leveraging edge computing, using lightweight machine learning algorithms, and performing preprocessing and feature extraction, it is possible to run machine learning algorithms on constrained devices despite these limitations. In this paper we test the burdens of some constrained IoT devices, probing that it is feasible to locally predict glycemia using a smartphone, up to 45 min in advance and with acceptable accuracy using random forest.

AB  - It is yet unknown what causes cardiovascular disease (CVD), but we do know that it is associated with a high risk of death, as well as severe morbidity and disability. There is an urgent need for AI-based technologies that are able to promptly and reliably predict the future outcomes of individuals who have cardiovascular disease. The Internet of Things (IoT) is serving as a driving force behind the development of CVD prediction. In order to analyse and make predictions based on the data that IoT devices receive, machine learning (ML) is used. Traditional machine learning algorithms are unable to take differences in the data into account and have a low level of accuracy in their model predictions. This research presents a collection of machine learning models that can be used to address this problem. These models take into account the data observation mechanisms and training procedures of a number of different algorithms. In order to verify the efficacy of our strategy, we combined the Heart Dataset with other classification models. The proposed method provides nearly 96 percent of accuracy result than other existing methods and the complete analysis over several metrics has been analysed and provided. Research in the field of deep learning will benefit from additional data from a large number of medical institutions, which may be used for the development of artificial neural network structures.

AB  - The integration of the Internet of Things with machine learning in different disciplines has benefited from recent technological advancements. In medical IoT, the fusion of these two disciplines can be extremely beneficial as it allows the creation of a receptive and interconnected environment and offers a variety of services to medical professionals and patients. Doctors can make early decisions to save a patient's life when disease forecasts are made early. IoT sensor captures the data from the patients, and machine learning techniques are used to analyze the data and predict the presence of the fatal disease i.e., diabetes. The goal of this research is to make a smart patient's health monitoring system based on machine learning that helps to detect the presence of a chronic disease in patient early and accurately. For the implementation, the diabetic dataset has been used. In order to detect the presence of the fatal disease, six different machine learning techniques are used i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by using four evaluation metrics i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. The RNN outperformed remaining algorithms in terms of accuracy (81%), precision (75%), and F1-Score (65%). However, the recall (56%) for ANN was higher as compared to SVM and logistic regression, CNN, RNN, and LSTM. With the help of this proposed patient's health monitoring system, doctors will be able to diagnose the presence of the disease earlier.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic disease that can affect human health negatively when the glucose levels in the blood are elevated over the creatin range called hyperglycemia. The current devices for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) supervise the glucose level in the blood and alert user to the type-1 Diabetes class once a certain critical level is surpassed. This can lead the body of the patient to work at critical levels until the medicine is taken in order to reduce the glucose level, consequently increasing the risk of causing considerable health damages in case of the intake is delayed. To overcome the latter, a new approach based on cutting-edge software and hardware technologies is proposed in this paper. Specifically, an artificial intelligence deep learning (DL) model is proposed to predict glucose levels in 30 min horizons. Moreover, Cloud computing and IoT technologies are considered to implement the prediction model and combine it with the existing wearable CGM model to provide the patients with the prediction of future glucose levels. Among the many DL methods in the state-of-the-art (SoTA) have been considered a cascaded RNN-RBM DL model based on both recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) due to their superior properties regarding improved prediction accuracy. From the conducted experimental results, it has been shown that the proposed Cloud&DL-based wearable approach achieves an average accuracy value of 15.589 in terms of RMSE, then outperforms similar existing blood glucose prediction methods in the SoTA.

AB  - Breast cancer affects one in every eight women and is the most common cancer. Aim. To diagnose breast cancer, a potentially fatal condition, using microarray technology, large datasets can now be used. Methods. This study used machine learning algorithms and IOT to classify microarray data. They were created from two sets of data: one with 1919 protein types and one with 24481 protein types for 97 people, 46 of whom had a recurring disease and 51 of whom did not. The apps were written in Python. Each classification algorithm was applied to the data separately, without any feature elimination or size reduction. Second, two alternative feature reduction approaches were compared to the first case. In this case, machine learning techniques like Adaboost and Gradient Boosting Machine are used. Results. Before applying any feature reduction techniques, the logistic regression method produced the best results (90.23%), while the Random Forest method produced good results (67.22%). In the first data, SVM had the highest accuracy rate of 99.23% in both approaches, while in the second data, SVM had the highest rate of 87.87% in RLR and 88.82% in LTE. Deep learning was also done with MLP. The relationship between depth and classification accuracy was studied using it at various depths. After a while, the accuracy rate declined as the number of layers increased. The maximum accuracy rate in the first data was 97.69%, while it was 68.72% in the second. As a result, adding layers to deep learning does not improve classification accuracy.

AB  - The diagnosis of heart disease has become a difficult medical task in the present medical research. This diagnosis depends on the detailed and precise analysis of the patients clinical test data on an individuals health history. The enormous developments in the field of deep learning seek to create intelligent automated systems that help doctors both to predict and to determine the disease with the internet of things (IoT) assistance. Therefore, the Enhanced Deep learning assisted Convolutional Neural Network (EDCNN) has been proposed to assist and improve patient prognostics of heart disease. The EDCNN model is focused on a deeper architecture which covers multi-layer perceptrons model with regularization learning approaches. Furthermore, the system performance is validated with full features and minimized features. Hence, the reduction in the features affects the efficiency of classifiers in terms of processing time, and accuracy has been mathematically analyzed with test results. The EDCNN system has been implemented on the Internet of Medical Things Platform (IoMT) for decision support systems which helps doctors to effectively diagnose heart patients information in cloud platforms anywhere in the world. The test results show compared to conventional approaches such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Ensemble Deep Learning-based smart healthcare system (EDL-SHS), Recurrent neural network (RNN), Neural network ensemble method (NNE), based on the analysis the designed diagnostic system can efficiently determine the risk level of heart disease effectively. Test results show that a flexible design and subsequent tuning of EDCNN hyperparameters can achieve a precision of up to 99.1%;.

AB  - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a multifarious progressive disease that increases the mortality and morbidity ratio as well as becoming a life-threatening issue of an individual. Accurate and cost-effective diagnosis of diseases plays a primary role in the medical domain and a wide range of research has been carried out on disease prediction using sensory approaches along with the assistance of machine learning techniques. The traditional disease diagnosis procedures are invasive, costlier and the decision support systems were unreliable most of the time. The human exhaled breath discharged from the body is composed of various Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) which can be influenced by metabolic and disease activities. Hence, the analysis of VOCs in exhaled breath has an incredible potentiality for COPD diagnosis and can rapidly decrease the mortality rate. In this research, IoT-Spiro System is designed and an intelligent machine learning forecasting framework (IMLFF) has been proposed. IoT-Spiro System perceives the various VOCs patterns available in exhaled breath and that real-time parameter has been analyzed using IMLFF. The proposed framework incorporates a hybrid Genetic Big Bang-Big Crunch (GBB-BC) algorithm for selecting the optimal features from the real-time dataset and a Fuzzy-based Quantum Neural Network (F-QNN) classifier for diagnosing COPD. The experimental results illustrate that IMLFF outperforms when compared to recent existing approaches concerning various statistical parameters and performance metrics. From the result analysis, it has been determined that IoT-Spiro System and IMLFF framework can serve as an efficient assisting model to the medical practitioner for diagnosing COPD.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cerebral vascular accidents (CVA) affect about 16 million people worldwide annually. CVA, also know as stroke, is a serious global health problem, and can cause significant physical limitations to those affected. Computed tomography is the most appropriate procedure to diagnose and evaluate the dimensions and magnitude of a stroke. Thus, in this article we present an Internet of Things (IoT) framework for the classification of stroke from CT images applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in order to identifying a healthy brain, an ischemic stroke or a hemorrhagic stroke. Following the Transfer Learning concept CNN was combined with different consolidated Machine Learning methods such as Bayesian Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines. Our approach contributes to the automation of the diagnostic process by a competent method that is able to obtain information imperceptible to the human eye, and thus it contributes to a more precise diagnosis. In addition, with the advent of IoT, a highly efficient and flexible new instrument emerges to address issues related to health care services and specifically in our approach can provide remote diagnoses and monitoring of patients. The approach was validated by analyzing the parameters Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall, Precision and processing time. The results showed that CNN obtained 100% Accuracy, F1-Score, Recall and Precision in combination with most of the classifiers tested. The shortest training and test times were 0.015 s and 0.001 s, respectively, both in combination with the Bayesian Classifier. Thus, our proposed approach demonstrates efficiency and reliability to detect strokes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist.
   Objective: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors.
   Methods: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system.
   Results: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03).
   Conclusions: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

AB  - The prediction of heart failure survivors is a challenging task and helps medical professionals to make the right decisions about patients. Expertise and experience of medical professionals are required to care for heart failure patients. Machine Learning models can help with understanding symptoms of cardiac disease. However, manual feature engineering is challenging and requires expertise to select the appropriate technique. This study proposes a smart healthcare framework using the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud technologies that improve heart failure patients' survival prediction without considering manual feature engineering. The smart IoT-based framework monitors patients on the basis of real-time data and provides timely, effective, and quality healthcare services to heart failure patients. The proposed model also investigates deep learning models in classifying heart failure patients as alive or deceased. The framework employs IoT-based sensors to obtain signals and send them to the cloud web server for processing. These signals are further processed by deep learning models to determine the state of patients. Patients' health records and processing results are shared with a medical professional who will provide emergency help if required. The dataset used in this study contains 13 features and was attained from the UCI repository known as Heart Failure Clinical Records. The experimental results revealed that the CNN model is superior to other deep learning and machine learning models with a 0.9289 accuracy value.

AB  - The heart diseases are one of the leading causes of death in today's world. Wearable Technology is gaining a lot of attention in today's world. This research focuses on developing a wearable biomedical prototype to predict the presence of heart disease. The research's findings will be especially helpful in countries where doctor to patient ratio is alarmingly low as wearable technology can be used to monitor parameters of patients anywhere, without restricting to hospital environments. The objective is to predict a possibility of heart disease using Machine Learning Algorithms. Electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns are obtained from the ECG sensor embedded in the wearable biomedical prototype. Variations in ECG patterns are monitored. ECG patterns are used to obtain the heart rate using the R-to-R method. Cleveland data set is used which has 13 attributes including ECG related attributes like resting ECG results, depression in ST-segment induced by exercise relative to rest and slope of peak exercise segment. The proposed system with the Random Forest Algorithm have predicted with an efficiency of 88%. For testing the prototype, human subjects are not involved rather we used static(real) data and the results are sent to the app to take necessary action. This prototype which is developed as a proof of concept will help the elderly people as an assistive equipment.

AB  - Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common and most costly chronic neurodegenerative disease globally. AD develops over an extended period prior to cognitive symptoms, leaving a "window of opportunity" for targeted risk-reduction interventions. Further, this pre-dementia phase includes early physiological changes in sleep and autonomic regulation, for which wearable biosensor devices may offer a convenient and cost-effective method to assess AD-risk. Methods Patients with a family history of AD and no or minimal cognitive complaints were recruited from the Alzheimer's Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine & New York-Presbyterian. Of the 40 consecutive patients screened, 34 (85%) agreed to wear a wearable biosensor device (WHOOP). One subject (2.5%) lost the device prior to data collection. Of the remaining subjects, 24 were classified as normal cognition and were asymptomatic, 6 were classified as subjective cognitive decline, and 3 were amyloid-positive (one with pre-clinical AD, one with pre-clinical Lewy-Body Dementia, and one with mild cognitive impairment due to AD). Sleep-cycle, autonomic (heart rate variability [HRV]) and activity measures were collected via WHOOP. Blood biomarkers and neuropsychological testing sensitive to cognitive changes in pre-clinical AD were obtained. Participants completed surveys assessing their sleep-patterns, exercise habits, and attitudes towards WHOOP. The goal of this prospective observational study was to determine the feasibility of using a wrist-worn biosensor device in patients at-risk for AD dementia. Unsupervised machine learning was performed to first separate participants into distinct phenotypic groups using the multivariate biometric data. Additional statistical analyses were conducted to examine correlations between individual biometric measures and cognitive performance. Results 27 (81.8%) participants completed the follow-up surveys. Twenty-four participants (88.9%) were satisfied with WHOOP after six months, and twenty-three (85.2%) wanted to continue wearing WHOOP. K-means clustering separated participants into two groups. Group 1 was older, had lower HRV, and spent more time in slow-wave sleep (SWS) than Group 2. Group 1 performed better on two cognitive tests assessing executive function: Flanker Inhibitory Attention/Control (FIAC) (p=.031), and Dimensional Change Card Sort (DCCS) (p=.061). In Group 1, DCCS was correlated with SWS (rho=.68, p=0.024) and HRV (rho=.6, p=0.019). In Group 2, DCCS was correlated with HRV (rho=.55, p=0.018). There were no significant differences in blood biomarkers between the two groups. Conclusions Wearable biosensor devices may be a feasible tool to assess AD-related physiological changes. Longitudinal collection of sleep and HRV data may potentially be a noninvasive method for monitoring cognitive changes related to pre-clinical AD. Further study is warranted in larger populations.

AB  - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive, obstructive lung disease that restricts airflow from the lungs. COPD patients are at risk of sudden and acute worsening of symptoms called exacerbations. Early identification and classification of COPD exacerbation can reduce COPD risks and improve patient's healthcare and management. Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive technique used to assess patients with acutely worsening symptoms. As part of manual diagnosis based on pulse oximetry, clinicians examine three warning signs to classify COPD patients. This may lack high sensitivity and specificity which requires a blood test. However, laboratory tests require time, further delayed treatment and additional costs. This research proposes a prediction method for COPD patients' classification based on pulse oximetry three manual warning signs and the resulting derived few key features that can be obtained in a short time. The model was developed on a robust physician labeled dataset with clinically diverse patient cases. Five classification algorithms were applied on the mentioned dataset and the results showed that the best algorithm is XGBoost with the accuracy of 91.04%, precision of 99.86%, recall of 82.19%, F1 measure value of 90.05% with an AUC value of 95.8%. Age, current and baseline heart rate, current and baseline pulse ox. (SPO2) were found the top most important predictors. These findings suggest the strength of XGBoost model together with the availability and the simplicity of input variables in classifying COPD daily living using a (wearable) pulse oximeter.

AB  - IntroductionBehavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) signal distress or unmet needs and present a risk to people with dementia and their caregivers. Variability in the expression of these symptoms is a barrier to the performance of digital biomarkers. The aim of this study was to use wearable multimodal sensors to develop personalized machine learning models capable of detecting individual patterns of BPSD. MethodsOlder adults with dementia and BPSD (n = 17) on a dementia care unit wore a wristband during waking hours for up to 8 weeks. The wristband captured motion (accelerometer) and physiological indicators (blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature). Agitation or aggression events were tracked, and research staff reviewed videos to precisely annotate the sensor data. Personalized machine learning models were developed using 1-minute intervals and classifying the presence of behavioral symptoms, and behavioral symptoms by type (motor agitation, verbal aggression, or physical aggression). ResultsBehavioral events were rare, representing 3.4% of the total data. Personalized models classified behavioral symptoms with a median area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.87 (range 0.64-0.95). The relative importance of the different sensor features to the predictive models varied both by individual and behavior type. DiscussionPatterns of sensor data associated with BPSD are highly individualized, and future studies of the digital phenotyping of these behaviors would benefit from personalization.

AB  - lot of diseases may be preventable if they can be analyzed or predicted from patient historical and family data. Predicting diagnosis depends on the gathered clinical and physiological data of patients. The more collected clinical and medical healthcare data, the more knowledge the medical support system may support. Hence, real monitoring clinical and healthcare data for patients is the trend of this decade based on Internet of Things technologies (IoT). IoT models facilitate human life by easily collecting clinical data remotely for recognizing diseases that are easily treatable if it is diagnosed early. This paper proposes a framework consisting of two models: (i) heart attack detection model (HADM); (ii) Electrocardiosignal ECG heartbeat multiclass-classification model (ECG-HMCM). Gridsearch is used to the hyperparameters optimization for different machine learning (ML) techniques. The used dataset in HADM consists of 1190 patients and 14 features. As the foundation of diagnosing cardiovascular disease is arrhythmia detection hence, we propose an ECG heartbeat multi-class classification model using MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic ECG signals dataset which contains five categories with 109446 samples. K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) technique is applied to build ECG-HMCM in addition to the using of Gridsearch algorithm for hyperparameter optimization aiming to improve the accuracy of classification which achieved 97.5%. The proposed framework aims to facilitate human life by easily collecting clinical data remotely. The outcomes of the experiments show that the suggested framework works well in a practical setting.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and although pancreatectomy is currently the only curative treatment, it is associated with significant morbidity.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning.
   Methods: In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves.
   Results: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875.
   Conclusions: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. The highest performance was observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical characteristics and activity metrics.

AB  - Background: Falls are a common complication experienced after a stroke and can cause serious detriments to physical health and social mobility, necessitating a dire need for intervention. Among recent advancements, wearable airbag technology has been designed to detect and mitigate fall impact. However, these devices have not been designed nor validated for the stroke population and thus, may inadequately detect falls in individuals with stroke-related motor impairments. To address this gap, we investigated whether population-specific training data and modeling parameters are required to pre-detect falls in a chronic stroke population.
   Methods: We collected data from a wearable airbag's inertial measurement units (IMUs) from individuals with (n= 20 stroke) and without (n = 15 control) history of stroke while performing a series of falls (842 falls total) and non-falls (961 non-falls total) in a laboratory setting. A leave-one-subject-out crossvalidation was used to compare the performance of two identical machine learned models (adaptive boosting classifier) trained on cohort-dependent data (control or stroke) to pre-detect falls in the stroke cohort.
   Results: The average performance of the model trained on stroke data (recall = 0.905, precision = 0.900) had statistically significantly better recall (P = 0.0035) than the model trained on control data (recall = 0.800, precision = 0.944), while precision was not statistically significantly different. Stratifying models trained on specific fall types revealed differences in pre-detecting anterior-posterior (AP) falls (stroke-trained model's F-1-score was 35% higher, P = 0.019). Using activities of daily living as non-falls training data (compared to near-falls) significantly increased the AUC (Area under the receiver operating characteristic) for classifying AP falls for both models (P < 0.04). Preliminary analysis suggests that users with more severe stroke impairments benefit further from a stroke-trained model. The optimal lead time (time interval pre-impact to detect falls) differed between control- and stroke-trained models.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate the importance of population sensitivity, non-falls data, and optimal lead time for machine learned pre-impact fall detection specific to stroke. Existing fall mitigation technologies should be challenged to include data of neurologically impaired individuals in model development to adequately detect falls in other high fall risk populations.

AB  - The leading causes of death worldwide are chronic illnesses suchlike diabetes, Heart Disease (HD), cancer as well as chronic respiratory malady. It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via '3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise '2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES.

AB  - Internet of Things, Machine learning, and Cloud computing are the emerging domains of information communication and technology. These techniques can help to save the life of millions in the medical assisted environment and can be utilized in health-care system where health expertise is less available. Fast food consumption increased from the past few decades, which makes up cholesterol, diabetes, and many more problems that affect the heart and other organs of the body. Changing lifestyle is another parameter that results in health issues including cardio-vascular diseases. Affirming to the World Health Organization, the cardiovascular diseases, or heart diseases lead to more death than any other disease globally. The objective of this research is to analyze the available data pertaining to cardiovascular diseases for prediction of heart diseases at an earlier stage to prevent it from occurring. The dataset of heart disease patients was taken from Jammu and Kashmir, India and stored over the cloud. Stored data is then pre-processed and further analyzed using machine learning techniques for the prediction of heart diseases. The analysis of the dataset using numerous machines learning techniques like Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive based, K-nearest neighbors, and Support Vector Machine revealed the performance metrics (F1 Score, Precision and Recall) for all the techniques which shows that Naive Bayes is better without parameter tuning while Random Forest algorithm proved as the best technique with hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, the proposed model is developed in such a systematic way that the clinical data can be obtained through the use of IoT with the help of available medical sensors to predict cardiovascular diseases on a real-time basis.

AB  - Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). In this study, a smartwatch-based sensor is utilized as a convenient tool to detect the abnormal RBD phenomenon in PD patients. Instead, a questionnaire with sleep quality assessment and sleep physiological indices, such as sleep stage, activity level, and heart rate, were measured in the smartwatch sensors. Therefore, this device can record comprehensive sleep physiological data, offering several advantages such as ubiquity, long-term monitoring, and wearable convenience. In addition, it can provide the clinical doctor with sufficient information on the patient's sleeping patterns with individualized treatment. In this study, a three-stage sleep staging method (i.e., comprising sleep/awake detection, sleep-stage detection, and REM-stage detection) based on an accelerometer and heart-rate data is implemented using machine learning (ML) techniques. The ML-based algorithms used here for sleep/awake detection, sleep-stage detection, and REM-stage detection were a Cole-Kripke algorithm, a stepwise clustering algorithm, and a k-means clustering algorithm with predefined criteria, respectively. The sleep staging method was validated in a clinical trial. The results showed a statistically significant difference in the percentage of abnormal REM between the control group (1.6 +/- 1.3; n = 18) and the PD group (3.8 +/- 5.0; n = 20) (p = 0.04). The percentage of deep sleep stage in our results presented a significant difference between the control group (38.1 +/- 24.3; n = 18) and PD group (22.0 +/- 15.0, n = 20) (p = 0.011) as well. Further, our results suggested that the smartwatch-based sensor was able to detect the difference of an abnormal REM percentage in the control group (1.6 +/- 1.3; n = 18), PD patient with clonazepam (2.0 +/- 1.7; n = 10), and without clonazepam (5.7 +/- 7.1; n = 10) (p = 0.007). Our results confirmed the effectiveness of our sensor in investigating the sleep stage in PD patients. The sensor also successfully determined the effect of clonazepam on reducing abnormal REM in PD patients. In conclusion, our smartwatch sensor is a convenient and effective tool for sleep quantification analysis in PD patients.

AB  - Objective: Photoplethysmography (PPG) monitoring has been implemented in many portable and wearable devices we use daily for health and fitness tracking. Its simplicity and cost-effectiveness has enabled a variety of biomedical applications, such as continuous long-term monitoring of heart arrhythmias, fitness, and sleep tracking, and hydration monitoring. One major issue that can hinder PPG-based applications is movement artifacts, which can lead to false interpretations. In many implementations, noisy PPG signals are discarded. Misinterpreted or discarded PPG signals pose a problem in applications where the goal is to increase the yield of detecting physiological events, such as in the case of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF)-a common episodic heart arrhythmia and a leading risk factor for stroke. In this work, we compared a traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in the presence of AF, in order to find the most robust method for PPG quality assessment. Approach: The training data set was composed of 78278 30s long PPG recordings from 3764 patients using bedside patient monitors. Two different representations of PPG signals were employed-a time-series based (1D) one and an image-based (2D) one. Trained models were tested on an independent set of 2683 30s PPG signals from 13 stroke patients. Main results: ResNet18 showed a higher performance (0.985 accuracy, 0.979 specificity, and 0.988 sensitivity) than SVM and other deep learning approaches. 2D-based models were generally more accurate than 1D-based models. Significance: 2D representation of PPG signal enhances the accuracy of PPG signal quality assessment.

AB  - Introduction: An early detection of impaired functional performance is critical to enhance symptom management for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, conventional functional measures based on walking assessments are often impractical for small clinics where the available space to administrate gait-based test is limited. This study examined the feasibility and effectiveness of an upper-extremity frailty meter (FM) in identifying digital measures of functional performance and assessing frailty in COPD patients. Methods: Forty-eight patients with COPD (age = 68.8 +/- 8.5 years, body mass index [BMI] = 28.7 +/- 5.8 kg/m(2)) and 49 controls (age = 70.0 +/- 3.0 years, BMI = 28.7 +/- 6.1 kg/m(2)) were recruited. All participants performed a 20-s repetitive elbow flexion-extension test using a wrist-worn FM sensor. Functional performance was quantified by FM metrics, including speed (slowness), range of motion (rigidity), power (weakness), flexion and extension time (slowness), as well as speed and power reduction (exhaustion). Conventional functional measures, including timed-up-and-go test, gait and balance tests, and 5 repetition sit-to-stand test, were also performed. Results: Compared to controls, COPD patients exhibited deteriorated performances in all conventional functional assessments (d = 0.64-1.26, p < 0.010) and all FM metrics (d = 0.45-1.54, p < 0.050). FM metrics had significant agreements with conventional assessment tools (|r| = 0.35-0.55, p <= 0.001). FM metrics efficiently identified COPD patients with pre-frailty and frailty (d = 0.82-2.12, p < 0.050). Conclusion: This study proposes the feasibility of using a 20-s repetitive elbow flexion-extension test and wrist-worn sensor-derived frailty metrics as an alternative and practical solution to evaluate functional performance in COPD patients. Its simplicity and low risk for test administration may also facilitate its application for remote patient monitoring. Furthermore, in settings where the administration of walking test is impractical, for example, when ventilator support is needed or space is limited, FM may be used as an alternative solution. Future studies are encouraged to use the FM to quantitatively monitor the progressive decline in functional performance and quantify outcomes of rehabilitation interventions.

AB  - An ability to extract detailed spirometry-like breathing waveforms from wearable sensors promises to greatly improve respiratory health monitoring. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has been researched in depth for estimation of respiration rate, given that it varies with respiration through overall intensity, pulse amplitude and pulse interval. We compare and contrast the extraction of these three respiratory modes from both the ear canal and finger and show a marked improvement in the respiratory power for respiration induced intensity variations and pulse amplitude variations when recording from the ear canal. We next employ a data driven multi-scale method, noise assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD), which allows for simultaneous analysis of all three respiratory modes to extract detailed respiratory waveforms from in-ear PPG. For rigour, we considered in-ear PPG recordings from healthy subjects, both older and young, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and healthy subjects with artificially obstructed breathing. Specific in-ear PPG waveform changes are observed for COPD, such as a decreased inspiratory duty cycle and an increased inspiratory magnitude, when compared with expiratory magnitude. These differences are used to classify COPD from healthy and IPF waveforms with a sensitivity of 87% and an overall accuracy of 92%.

AB  - The age profiles of many countries are increasing day by day with increasing population of individuals affected by the chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and so on. In order to maintain the individual living, remote health monitoring with daily activity by recognising people is a promising solution. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality globally. Most of the deaths due to CVD are sudden and without any chance of medical help. In order to avoid this accidental death, precautions are required with continuous monitoring of body parameters such as heart rate, pulse rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) to show the current status of the health. Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing industry in many disciplines including healthcare. In current research, heart disease is monitored with processing of electrocardiogram signals. The existing monitoring system lacks in prediction accuracy and remote monitoring. In this proposed work, the gathered data from the wearable devices are preprocessed to remove the noise. The relevant features for better recognition are selected using the proposed LBPNet with particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Then sequential minimal optimisation based SVM classifier recognises the abnormalities of heart disease from normal patients for diagnosis. These data are available in remote servers for doctors and care takers with IoT application. The care takers are notified about the patient health using smart phones. This proposed system is useful for cardiac patient monitoring and updation with high accuracy.

AB  - Healthcare 4.0 paradigm aims at realization of data-driven and patient-centric health systems wherein advanced sensors can be deployed to provide personalized assistance. Hence, extreme mentally affected patients from diseases like Alzheimer can be assisted using sophisticated algorithms and enabling technologies. Motivated from this fact, in this paper, DeTrAs: Deep Learning-based Internet of Health Framework for the Assistance of Alzheimer Patients is proposed. DeTrAs works in three phases: (1) A recurrent neural network-based Alzheimer prediction scheme is proposed which uses sensory movement data, (2) an ensemble approach for abnormality tracking for Alzheimer patients is designed which comprises two parts: (a) convolutional neural network-based emotion detection scheme and (b) timestamp window-based natural language processing scheme, and (3) an IoT-based assistance mechanism for the Alzheimer patients is also presented. The evaluation of DeTrAs depicts almost 10-20% improvement in terms of accuracy in contrast to the different existing machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Background Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for the development of low cardiac output and other physiologic derangements, which could be detected early through continuous stroke volume (SV) measurement. Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). Methods and Results We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R-2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. Conclusions A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD.

AB  - The Internet of Things confers seamless connectivity between people and objects, and its confluence with the Cloud improves our lives. Predictive analytics in the medical domain can help turn a reactive healthcare strategy into a proactive one, with advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches permeating the healthcare industry. As the subfield of ML, deep learning possesses the transformative potential for accurately analysing vast data at exceptional speeds, eliciting intelligent insights, and efficiently solving intricate issues. The accurate and timely prediction of diseases is crucial in ensuring preventive care alongside early intervention for people at risk. With the widespread adoption of electronic clinical records, creating prediction models with enhanced accuracy is key to harnessing recurrent neural network variants of deep learning possessing the ability to manage sequential time-series data. The proposed system acquires data from IoT devices, and the electronic clinical data stored on the cloud pertaining to patient history are subjected to predictive analytics. The smart healthcare system for monitoring and accurately predicting heart disease risk built around Bi-LSTM (bidirectional long short-term memory) showcases an accuracy of 98.86%, a precision of 98.9%, a sensitivity of 98.8%, a specificity of 98.89%, and an F-measure of 98.86%, which are much better than the existing smart heart disease prediction systems.

AB  - This study evaluated the accuracy of tennis-specific stroke and movement event detection algorithms from a cervically mounted wearable sensor containing a triaxial accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. Stroke and movement data from up to eight high-performance tennis players were captured in match-play and movement drills. Prototype algorithms classified stroke (i.e., forehand, backhand, serve) and movement (i.e., "Alert", "Dynamic", "Running", "Low Intensity") events. Manual coding evaluated stroke actions in three classes (i.e., forehand, backhand and serve), with additional descriptors of spin (e.g., slice). Movement data was classified according to the specific locomotion performed (e.g., lateral shuffling). The algorithm output for strokes were analysed against manual coding via absolute (n) and relative (%) error rates. Coded movements were grouped according to their frequency within the algorithm's four movement classifications. Highest stroke accuracy was evident for serves (98%), followed by groundstrokes (94%). Backhand slice events showed 74% accuracy, while volleys remained mostly undetected (41-44%). Tennis-specific footwork patterns were predominantly grouped as "Dynamic" (63% of total events), alongside successful linear "Running" classifications (74% of running events). Concurrent stroke and movement data from wearable sensors allows detailed and long-term monitoring of tennis training for coaches and players. Improvements in movement classification sensitivity using tennis-specific language appear warranted.

AB  - Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic red blood cell disorder associated with severe complications including chronic anemia, stroke, and vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs). VOCs are unpredictable, difficult to treat, and the leading cause of hospitalization. Recent efforts have focused on the use of mobile health technology to develop algorithms to predict pain in people with sickle cell disease. Combining the data collection abilities of a consumer wearable, such as the Apple Watch, and machine learning techniques may help us better understand the pain experience and find trends to predict pain from VOCs.Objective: The aim of this study is to (1) determine the feasibility of using the Apple Watch to predict the pain scores in people with sickle cell disease admitted to the Duke University SCD Day Hospital, referred to as the Day Hospital, and (2) build and evaluate machine learning algorithms to predict the pain scores of VOCs with the Apple Watch.Methods: Following approval of the institutional review board, patients with sickle cell disease, older than 18 years, and admitted to Day Hospital for a VOC between July 2021 and September 2021 were approached to participate in the study. Participants were provided with an Apple Watch Series 3, which is to be worn for the duration of their visit. Data collected from the Apple Watch included heart rate, heart rate variability (calculated), and calories. Pain scores and vital signs were collected from the electronic medical record. Data were analyzed using 3 different machine learning models: multinomial logistic regression, gradient boosting, and random forest, and 2 null models, to assess the accuracy of pain scores. The evaluation metrics considered were accuracy (F1-score), area under the receiving operating characteristic curve, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). Results: We enrolled 20 patients with sickle cell disease, all of whom identified as Black or African American and consisted of 12 (60%) females and 8 (40%) males. There were 14 individuals diagnosed with hemoglobin type SS (70%). The median age of the population was 35.5 (IQR 30-41) years. The median time each individual spent wearing the Apple Watch was 2 hours and 17 minutes and a total of 15,683 data points were collected across the population. All models outperformed the null models, and the best-performing model was the random forest model, which was able to predict the pain scores with an accuracy of 84.5%, and a RMSE of 0.84.Conclusions: The strong performance of the model in all metrics validates feasibility and the ability to use data collected from a noninvasive device, the Apple Watch, to predict the pain scores during VOCs. It is a novel and feasible approach and presents a low-cost method that could benefit clinicians and individuals with sickle cell disease in the treatment of VOCs.(JMIR Form Res 2023;7:e45355) doi: 10.2196/45355

AB  - Heart disease is an emerging health issue in the medical field, according to WHO every year around 10 billion people are affected with heart abnormalities. Arteries in the heart generate oxygenated blood to all body parts, however sometimes blood vessels become clogged or restrained due to cardiac issues. Past heart diagnosis applications are outdated and suffer from poor performance. Therefore, an intelligent heart disease diagnosis application design is required. In this research work, internet of things (IoT) sensor data with a deep learning-based heart diagnosis application is designed. The heart disease IoT sensor data is collected from the University of California Irvine machine learning repository free open-source dataset which is useful for training the deep graph convolutional network (DG_ConvoNet) deep learning network. The testing data has been collected from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation; it is a collection of 350 real-time clinical instances from heart patients through IoT sensors. The K-means technique is employed to remove noise in sensor data and clustered the unstructured data. The features are extracted to employ Linear Quadratic Discriminant Analysis. DG_ConvoNet is a deep learning process to classify and predict heart diseases. The diagnostic application achieves an accuracy of 96%, sensitivity of 80%, specificity of 73%, precision of 90%, F-Score of 79%, and area under the ROC curve of 75% implementing the proposed model.

AB  - Utilizing smart face masks to monitor and analyze respiratory signals is a convenient and effective method to give an early warning for chronic respiratory diseases. In this work, a smart face mask is proposed with an air-permeable and biodegradable self-powered breath sensor as the key component. This smart face mask is easily fabricated, comfortable to use, eco-friendly, and has sensitive and stable output performances in real wearable conditions. To verify the practicability, we use smart face masks to record respiratory signals of patients with chronic respiratory diseases when the patients do not have obvious symptoms. With the assistance of the machine learning algorithm of the bagged decision tree, the accuracy for distinguishing the healthy group and three groups of chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is up to 95.5%. These results indicate that the strategy of this work is feasible and may promote the development of wearable health monitoring systems.

AB  - Heart disease is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is a critical challenge in the area of clinical data analysis. Machine learning (ML) has been shown to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry. We have also seen ML techniques being used in recent developments in different areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). Various studies give only a glimpse into predicting heart disease with ML techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel method that aims at finding significant features by applying machine learning techniques resulting in improving the accuracy in the prediction of cardiovascular disease. The prediction model is introduced with different combinations of features and several known classification techniques. We produce an enhanced performance level with an accuracy level of 88.7% through the prediction model for heart disease with the hybrid random forest with a linear model (HRFLM).

AB  - Objective: Several features of the surface electromyography (sEMG) signal are related to muscle activity and fatigue. However, the time-evolution of these features are non-stationary and vary between subjects. The aim of this study is to investigate the use of adaptive algorithms to forecast sEMG feature of the trunk muscles. Methods: Shallow models and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to simultaneously learn and forecast 5 common sEMG features in real-time to provide tailored predictions. This was investigated for: up to a 25 second horizon; for 14 different muscles in the trunk; across 13 healthy subjects; while they were performing various exercises. Results: The CNN was able to forecast 25 seconds ahead of time, with 6.88% mean absolute percentage error and 3.72% standard deviation of absolute percentage error, across all the features. Moreover, the CNN outperforms the best shallow model in terms of a figure of merit combining accuracy and precision by at least 30% for all the 5 features. Conclusion: Even though the sEMG features are non-stationary and vary between subjects, adaptive learning and forecasting, especially using CNNs, can provide accurate and precise forecasts across a range of physical activities. Significance: The proposed models provide the groundwork for a wearable device which can forecast muscle fatigue in the trunk, so as to potentially prevent low back pain. Additionally, the explicit real-time forecasting of sEMG features provides a general model which can be applied to many applications of muscle activity monitoring, which helps practitioners and physiotherapists improve therapy.

AB  - Nowadays, heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Predicting heart disease is a complex task since it requires experience along with advanced knowledge. Internet of Things (IoT) technology has lately been adopted in healthcare systems to collect sensor values for heart disease diagnosis and prediction. Many researchers have focused on the diagnosis of heart disease, yet the accuracy of the diagnosis results is low. To address this issue, an IoT framework is proposed to evaluate heart disease more accurately using a Modified Deep Convolutional Neural Network (MDCNN). The smartwatch and heart monitor device that is attached to the patient monitors the blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG). The MDCNN is utilized for classifying the received sensor data into normal and abnormal. The performance of the system is analyzed by comparing the proposed MDCNN with existing deep learning neural networks and logistic regression. The results demonstrate that the proposed MDCNN based heart disease prediction system performs better than other methods. The proposed method shows that for the maximum number of records, the MDCNN achieves an accuracy of 98.2 which is better than existing classifiers.

AB  - The variation in skin textures and injuries, as well as the detection and classification of skin cancer, is a difficult task. Manually detecting skin lesions from dermoscopy images is a difficult and time-consuming process. Recent advancements in the domains of the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence for medical applications demonstrated improvements in both accuracy and computational time. In this paper, a new method for multiclass skin lesion classification using best deep learning feature fusion and an extreme learning machine is proposed. The proposed method includes five primary steps: image acquisition and contrast enhancement; deep learning feature extraction using transfer learning; best feature selection using hybrid whale optimization and entropy-mutual information (EMI) approach; fusion of selected features using a modified canonical correlation based approach; and, finally, extreme learning machine based classification. The feature selection step improves the system's computational efficiency and accuracy. The experiment is carried out on two publicly available datasets, HAM10000 and ISIC2018. The achieved accuracy on both datasets is 93.40 and 94.36 percent. When compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, the proposed method's accuracy is improved. Furthermore, the proposed method is computationally efficient.

AB  - In recent times, Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing (CC) paradigms are commonly employed in different healthcare applications. IoT gadgets generate huge volumes of patient data in healthcare domain, which can be examined on cloud over the available storage and computation resources in mobile gadgets. Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is one of the deadliest diseases that has high mortality rate across the globe. The current research work presents a novel IoT and cloud-based CKD diagnosis model called Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA)-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) model abbreviated as FPA-DNN. The steps involved in the presented FPA-DNN model are data collection, preprocessing, Feature Selection (FS), and classification. Primarily, the IoT gadgets are utilized in the collection of a patient's health information. The proposed FPA-DNN model deploys Oppositional Crow Search (OCS) algorithm for FS, which selects the optimal subset of features from the preprocessed data. The application of FPA helps in tuning the DNN parameters for better classification performance. The sim-ulation analysis of the proposed FPA-DNN model was performed against the benchmark CKD dataset. The results were examined under different aspects. The simulation outcomes established the superior performance of FPA-DNN technique by achieving the highest sensitivity of 98.80%, specificity of 98.66%, accuracy of 98.75%, F-score of 99%, and kappa of 97.33%.

AB  - Among the applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), continuous health monitoring system is a particularly important one. Wearable sensor devices used in IoT health monitoring system have been generating an enormous amount of data on a continuous basis. The data generation speed of IoT sensor devices is very high. Hence, the volume of data generated from the IoT-based health monitoring system is also very high. In order to overcome this issue, this paper proposes a scalable three-tier architecture to store and process such huge volume of wearable sensor data. Tier-1 focuses on collection of data from IoT wearable sensor devices. Tier-2 uses Apache HBase for storing the large volume of wearable IoT sensor data in cloud computing. In addition, Tier-3 uses Apache Mahout for developing the logistic regression-based prediction model for heart diseases. Finally, ROC analysis is performed to identify the most significant clinical parameters to get heart disease. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) claimed 3.0 million lives in 2016 and ranked 3rd among the top 10 global causes of death. Moreover, once diagnosed and discharged from the hospital, the 30-day readmission risk in COPD patients is found to be the highest among all chronic diseases. The existing diagnosis methods, such as Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2019, Body-mass index, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise (BODE) index, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC), COPD assessment test (CAT), 6-minute walking distance, which are adopted currently by physicians cannot predict the potential readmission of COPD patients, especially within the 30 days after discharge from the hospital. In this paper, a statistical model was proposed to predict the readmission risk of COPD patients within 30-days by monitoring their physical activity (PA) in daily living with accelerometer-based wrist-worn wearable devices. This proposed model was based on our previously reported PA models for activity index (AI) and regularity index (RI) and it introduced a new parameter, quality of activity (QoA), which incorporates previously proposed parameters, such as AI and RI, with other activity-based indices to predict the readmission risk. Data were collected from continuous PA monitoring of 16 COPD patients after hospital discharge as test subjects and readmission prediction criteria were proposed, with a 63% sensitivity and a 37.78% positive prediction rate. Compared to other clinical assessment, diagnosis, and prevention methods, the proposed model showed significant improvement in predicting the 30-day readmission risk.

AB  - Heart disease is the biggest cause of death in the globe. The method of predicting cardiac disease is exceedingly complex. It can only be done properly if the doctor has a lot of expertise and is well-versed in the condition. IoT-based illness prediction is a relatively recent technology for accurately classifying diseases based on sensor data. This system proposes an enhanced deep learning-based framework for predicting the heart disease. The general publicly available Hungarian heart disease dataset is utilized for the implementation, which includes heart disease related data collected from patients through IoT sensor devices. The input dataset is preprocessed using Median Studentized Residual approach for resolving error data and missing values. Preprocessed data values are feature selected by Harris Hawk Optimization (HHO) approach. The selected features are then classified into normal and abnormal by Modified Deep Long Short-Term Memory (MDLSTM). The modification in LSTM output is altered using Improved Spotted Hyena Optimization (ISHO) algorithm. The results are implemented in the working platform of Phyton with the metrics such as specificity, sensitivity, F-Score, Kappa value, Accuracy, BER and Execution time. The analyzed results shows that the implemented methodology is superior in the prediction of heart disease with an accuracy of 98.01% and reduced error rate of 91.11 compared with other existing techniques.

AB  - Heart disease is one of the most prominent and dangerous diseases that threaten public health around the world, often leading to heart attacks and strokes. More recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) based health monitoring system and many others continuously generate enormous amounts of data. With the heart disease patients under supervision have been increasing significantly, data generation speed is very high. In the scope of application of machine learning to the health data, there is a significant need to real-time streaming data processing to ensure an effective and scalable solution to effectively find and prevent the heart disease within a short and very specific timeline. As the amount of available data becomes highly big, the process of building and testing the traditional machine learning can be quite time consuming. The combination of streaming big data and machine learning is a breakthrough technology that can have a significant impact in the healthcare field especially real-time detection of heart disease. In this paper, we propose a new heart disease monitoring system based on a new classification approach consisting of the real-time distributed machine learning which uses the real-time predictive analysis algorithm in the Spark environment to predict heart disease. Firstly, we transform the traditional decision tree (C4.5) algorithm into parallel, distributed, scalable and fast decision tree. Secondly, this model is applied to streaming data coming from distributed sources to predict heart disease in real-time. The result as well as data streams will be stored in a distributed database for real-time reporting and monitoring. The results show better performance and have the potential to open new opportunities in distributed machine learning.

AB  - With a massive influx of multimodality data, the role of data analytics in health informatics has grown rapidly in the last decade. This has also prompted increasing interests in the generation of analytical, data driven models based on machine learning in health informatics. Deep learning, a technique with its foundation in artificial neural networks, is emerging in recent years as a powerful tool for machine learning, promising to reshape the future of artificial intelligence. Rapid improvements in computational power, fast data storage, and parallelization have also contributed to the rapid uptake of the technology in addition to its predictive power and ability to generate automatically optimized high-level features and semantic interpretation from the input data. This article presents a comprehensive up-to-date review of research employing deep learning in health informatics, providing a critical analysis of the relative merit, and potential pitfalls of the technique as well as its future outlook. The paper mainly focuses on key applications of deep learning in the fields of translational bioinformatics, medical imaging, pervasive sensing, medical informatics, and public health.

AB  - Background: The use of vital signs monitoring in the early recognition of an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) post-hospital discharge is limited. This study investigated whether continuous vital signs monitoring could predict an AECOPD and readmission.
   Methods: 35 people were recruited at discharge following hospitalisation for an AECOPD. Participants were asked to wear an Equivital LifeMonitor during waking hours for 6 weeks and to complete the Exacerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT), a 14-item symptom diary, daily. The Equivital LifeMonitor recorded respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), skin temperature (ST) and physical activity (PA) every 15-s. An AECOPD was classified as mild (by EXACT score), moderate (prescribed oral steroids/antibiotics) or severe (hospitalisation).
   Results: Over the 6-week period, 31 participants provided vital signs and symptom data and 14 participants experienced an exacerbation, of which, 11 had sufficient data to predict an AECOPD. HR and PA were associated with EXACT score (p < 0.001). Three days prior to an exacerbation, RR increased by mean +/- SD 2.0 +/- 0.2 breaths/min for seven out of 11 exacerbations and HR increased by 8.1 +/- 0.7 bpm for nine of these 11 exacerbations.
   Conclusions: Increased heart rate and reduced physical activity were associated with worsening symptoms. Even with high-resolution data, the variation in vital signs data remains a challenge for predicting AECOPDs. Respiratory rate and heart rate should be further explored as potential predictors of an impending AECOPD.

AB  - Melanoma is considered to be one of the most dangerous human malignancy, which is diagnosed visually or by dermoscopic analysis and histopathological examination. However, as these traditional methods are based on human experience and implemented manually, there have been great limitations for general usability in current clinical practice. In this paper, a novel hybrid machine learning approach is proposed to identify melanoma for skin healthcare in various cases. The proposed approach consists of classic machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNet, and XGBoost supervised machine learning. In the proposed approach, a deep learning model is trained directly from raw pixels and image labels for classification of skin lesions. Then, solely based on modeling of various features from patients, an XGBoost model is adopted to predict skin cancer. Following that, a diagnostic system which composed of the deep learning model and XGBoost model is developed to further improve the prediction efficiency and accuracy. Different from experience-based methods and solely image-based machine learning methods, the proposed approach is developed based on the theory of deep learning and feature engineering. Experiments show that the hybrid model outperforms single model like the traditional deep learning model or XGBoost model. Moreover, the data-driven-based characteristics can help the proposed approach develop a guideline for image analysis in other medical applications.

AB  - Health monitoring is one of the sustainable development areas throughout the globe and Diabetes Mellitus is a common disease worldwide that is one of the main causes of health disasters. Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) technology together provide a proficient approach for monitoring and predicting diabetes mellitus. In this article, we have proposed a model which uses the hybrid enhanced adaptive data rate (HEADR) algorithm for long range (LoRa) protocol of the Internet of Things (IoT) for patient's real-time data gathering. Further, machine learning prediction takes place by using classification methods for the detection of diabetes severity levels on collected data through LoRa protocol. The performance of the LoRa protocol is evaluated on the Contiki Cooja simulator based on throughput and packet collision parameters. The proposed model uses different machine learning classifiers, namely, gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), logistic regression (LR), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) to predict diabetes with maximum accuracy score, precision, recall, F-measure, and receiver operating curve (ROC), using Python programming language.

AB  - Melanoma skin cancer is one of the most common diseases in the world. It is essential to diagnose melanoma at an early stage. Visual inspection during the medical examination of skin lesions is not a simple task, as there is a similarity between lesions. Also, medical experience and disposition can result in inaccurate diagnoses. Technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) have helped to create effective health systems. Doctors can use them anywhere, with the guarantee that more people can be diagnosed without prejudice to subjective factors. Transfer Learning and Deep Learning are increasingly significant in the clinical diagnosis of different diseases. This work proposes the use of Transfer Learning and Deep Learning in an IoT system to assist doctors in the diagnosis of common skin lesions, typical nevi, and melanoma. This work uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as resource extractors. The CNN models used were: Visual Geometry Group (VGG), Inception, Residual Networks (ResNet), Inception-ResNet, Extreme Inception (Xception), MobileNet, Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), and Neural Architecture Search Network (NASNet). For the classification of injuries, the Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Perceptron Multilayer (MLP), and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers are used. This study used two datasets: the first provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) at the International Biomedical Imaging Symposium (ISBI); the second is PH2. For ISBI-ISIC, this study examined lesions between nevi and melanomas. In PH2, this work analyzed the diagnosis based on lesions of common nevus, atypical nevi, and melanomas. The DenseNet201 extraction model, combined with the KNN classifier achieved an accuracy of 96.805% for the ISBI-ISIC dataset and 93.167% for the PH2. Thus, an approach focused on the IoT system is reliable and efficient for doctors who assist in the diagnosis of skin lesions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The pronator drift test (PDT), a neurological examination, is widely used in clinics to measure motor weakness of stroke patients.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a PDT tool with machine learning classifiers to detect stroke symptoms based on quantification of proximal arm weakness using inertial sensors and signal processing.
   Methods: We extracted features of drift and pronation from accelerometer signals of wearable devices on the inner wrists of 16 stroke patients and 10 healthy controls. Signal processing and feature selection approach were applied to discriminate PDT features used to classify stroke patients. A series of machine learning techniques, namely support vector machine (SVM), radial basis function network (RBFN), and random forest (RF), were implemented to discriminate stroke patients from controls with leave-one-out cross-validation.
   Results: Signal processing by the PDT tool extracted a total of 12 PDT features from sensors. Feature selection abstracted the major attributes from the 12 PDT features to elucidate the dominant characteristics of proximal weakness of stroke patients using machine learning classification. Our proposed PDT classifiers had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of .806 (SVM), .769 (RBFN), and .900 (RF) without feature selection, and feature selection improves the AUCs to .913 (SVM), .956 (RBFN), and .975 (RF), representing an average performance enhancement of 15.3%.
   Conclusions: Sensors and machine learning methods can reliably detect stroke signs and quantify proximal arm weakness. Our proposed solution will facilitate pervasive monitoring of stroke patients.

AB  - Globally, the prognosis of heart disease can be improved by early diagnosis and treatment. However, existing automatic systems for diagnosing heart disease are hampered by the requisite big data. This paper introduces an Internet of Things-based medical device for collecting patients' heart details before and after heart disease. The information, which is continuously transmitted to the health care center, is processed using the higher order Boltzmann deep belief neural network (HOBDBNN). The deep learning method learns heart disease features from past analysis, and achieves efficiency by the effective manipulation of complex data. Following experiments, the performance of the system is evaluated based on characteristics such as f-measure, sensitivity, specificity, loss function, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The HOBDBNN method and IoT-based analysis recognize heart disease with 99.03% accuracy with minimum time complexity (8.5 s), effectively minimizing heart disease mortality by reducing the complexity of diagnosing heart disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND Atrial fibrillation (AF), a common cause of stroke, often is asymptomatic. Smartphones and smartwatches can detect AF using heart rate patterns inferred using photoplethysmography (PPG); however, enhanced accuracy is required to reduce false positives in screening populations. OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a deep learning algorithm given raw, smartwatch-derived PPG waveforms would discriminate AF from normal sinus rhythm better than algorithms using heart rate alone. METHODS Patients presenting for cardioversion of AF (n 5 51) were given wrist-worn fitness trackers containing PPG sensors (Jawbone Health). Standard 12-lead electrocardiograms over-read by board-certified cardiac electrophysiologists were used as the reference standard. The accuracy of PPG signals to discriminate AF from sinus rhythm was evaluated by conventional measures of heart rate variability, a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network given heart rate data only, and a deep convolutional-recurrent neural net (DNN) given the raw PPG data. RESULTS From among 51 patients with persistent AF (age 63.6 +/- 11.3 years; 78% male; 88% white), we randomly assigned 40 to train and 11 to test the algorithms. Whereas logistic regression analysis of heart rate variability yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.717 (sensitivity 0.741; specificity 0.584), the LSTM model given heart rate data exhibited AUC of 0.954 (sensitivity 0.810; specificity 0.921), and the DNN model given raw PPG data yielded the highest AUC of 0.983 (sensitivity 0.985; specificity 0.880). CONCLUSION A deep learning model given the raw PPG-based signal resulted in AF detection with high accuracy, performing better than conventional analyses relying on heart rate series data alone.

AB  - Medical cancer rehabilitation healthcare center data maintenance is a global challenge with increased mortality risk. The Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications in healthcare were implemented through sensors and various connecting devices. The main problem of this procedure is the privacy of data, which is the biggest challenge with IoT, as all the connected devices transfer data in real time, the integration of multiple and other protocols can be hacked by the end-to-end connection, and it is not secure, security issues may crop up due to handling of such massive data in real time. Recent studies showed that a more structured risk assessment is needed to secure the medical cancer rehabilitation healthcare center data maintenance. In this respect, collaborative learning frameworks, such as Deep Federated Collaborative Learning (DFCL), are implemented for the study of medical cancer rehabilitation healthcare center data maintenance based on IoT-based systems and are proposed with smart short-term Bayesian convolution network systems for data analysis. This DFCL approach has been preferred in this context, strengthening privacy by allowing sensitive data to be retained. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the federated model balances fairness, privacy, and accuracy. In this paper, we analyze administrative data count by medical stages taken from 2016 to 2022, the administrative data include data for routine operations. It is frequently used to assess by achieving an accuracy range of 19.8%. The leading diagnoses taken as per the patient's cost and stay count identifying a disease, illness, or problem by examining the unusual combination of symptoms made an accurate diagnosis which is 26% more efficient than the leading diagnosis. The hospital dictionary analysis is based on dictionary analysis count and data visualization summary; accuracy is 50% higher than the existing data visualization summary. By comparing the hospital dictionary, home health care analysis shows a 44.5% efficient analysis rate for patient data maintenance. Moreover, the adult day-care centers analyzed 88.6% efficient analysis rate for patient data maintenance with 750 patients.

AB  - Recently, it has proven difficult to make an immediate remote diagnosis of any coronary illness, including heart disease, diabetes, etc. The drawbacks of cloud computing infrastructures, such as excessive latency, bandwidth, energy consumption, security, and privacy concerns, have lately been addressed by Fog computing with IoT applications. In this study, an IoT-Fog-Cloud integrated system, called a Fog-empowered framework for real-time analysis in heart patients using ENsemble Deep learning (FRIEND), has been introduced that can instantaneously facilitate remote diagnosis of heart patients. The proposed system was trained on the combined dataset of Long-Beach, Cleveland, Switzerland, and Hungarian heart disease datasets. We first tested the model with eight basic ML approaches, including the decision tree, logistic regression, random forest, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, AdaBoost, and XGBoost approaches, and then applied ensemble methods including bagging classifiers, weighted averaging, and soft and hard voting to achieve enhanced outcomes and a deep neural network, a deep learning approach, with the ensemble methods. These models were validated using 16 performance and 9 network parameters to justify this work. The accuracy, PPV, TPR, TNR, and F1 scores of the experiments reached 94.27%, 97.59%, 96.09%, 75.44%, and 96.83%, respectively, which were comparatively higher when the deep neural network was assembled with bagging and hard-voting classifiers. The user-friendliness and the inclusion of Fog computing principles, instantaneous remote cardiac patient diagnosis, low latency, and low energy consumption, etc., are advantages confirmed according to the achieved experimental results.

AB  - There has been an upsurge recently in investigating machine learning techniques for activity recognition (AR) problems as they have been very effective in extracting and learning knowledge from the activity datasets. The technique ranges from heuristically derived hand-crafted feature-based traditional machine learning algorithms to the recently developed hierarchically self-evolving feature-based deep learning algorithms. AR continues to remain a challenging problem in uncontrolled smart environments despite the amount of work contributed by the researcher in this field. The complex, volatile, and chaotic nature of the activity data presents numerous challenges that influence the performance of the AR systems in the wild. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of recent machine learning and data mining techniques generally employed for AR and the underpinning problems and challenges associated with the existing systems. We also articulate the recent advances and state-of-the-art techniques in this domain in an attempt to identify the possible directions for future AR research. This article is categorized under:

AB  - Efficient, adaptive, locomotor function is critically important for maintaining our health and independence, but falls-related injuries when walking are a significant risk factor, particularly for more vulnerable populations such as older people and post-stroke individuals. Tripping is the leading cause of falls, and the swing-phase event Minimum Foot Clearance (MFC) is recognised as the key biomechanical determinant of tripping probability. MFC is defined as the minimum swing foot clearance, which is seen approximately mid-swing, and it is routinely measured in gait biomechanics laboratories using precise, high-speed, camera-based 3D motion capture systems. For practical intervention strategies designed to predict, and possibly assist, swing foot trajectory to prevent tripping, identification of the MFC event is essential; however, no technique is currently available to determine MFC timing in real-life settings outside the laboratory. One strategy has been to use wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), but these data are limited to primarily providing only tri-axial linear acceleration and angular velocity. The aim of this study was to develop Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict MFC timing based on the preceding toe-off gait event. The ML algorithms were trained using 13 young adults' foot trajectory data recorded from an Optotrak 3D motion capture system. A Deep Learning configuration was developed based on a Recurrent Neural Network with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture and Huber loss-functions to minimise MFC-timing prediction error. We succeeded in predicting MFC timing from toe-off characteristics with a mean absolute error of 0.07 s. Although further algorithm training using population-specific inputs are needed. The ML algorithms designed here can be used for real-time actuation of wearable active devices to increase foot clearance at critical MFC and reduce devastating tripping falls. Further developments in ML-guided actuation for active exoskeletons could prove highly effective in developing technologies to reduce tripping-related falls across a range of gait impaired populations.

AB  - The applications of IoT have been employed in diverse domains like industries, clinical care, and farming, and so forth. Nowadays, the constitution of this technology is more prevalent in clinical observation, where the wearable devices have stimulated the development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). In the process of reducing the death rate, it is necessary to detect the disease at an earlier stage. The cardiac disease prediction is a major defect in the examination of the dataset in clinics. The research proposed aims to recognize the important cardiac complaint prediction characteristics by utilizing machine-learning methodologies. Numerous projects have been established regarding the diagnosis of cardiac complaints, which results in low accuracy rate. Thus, for improving the accuracy of prediction and for cardiac complaint investigation this article utilized a fuzzy c-means neural network (FNN) and a deep convolution neural network for feature extraction. From the clinical dataset, data were obtained for the risk prediction of cardiac complaints that includes blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, and so forth. The hearts condition is recognized by categorizing the sensor data received by FNN. The evaluation performances were carried out and the results revealed that FNN is good in predicting the cardiac complaints. In addition to this, the proposed model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches through the demonstration of simulation results. The proposed approach attains the accuracy rate of 86.4% and F1-score of 97%, precision 76.2%, and 64.6% of FPR.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled e-healthcare applications are contributing more to the society for providing healthcare monitoring services efficiently in smart environment. Security of healthcare system is to be considered as an important issue due to the huge volume of users and their secret data availability in this fast internet era and cloud databases. To store the patient's health data securely in the form of electronic version raises the concerns about the patient data privacy and security. Moreover, handling volume of data is also very complex task today with normal classifiers. For this purpose, many deep learning algorithms are available for classifying the huge volume of data successfully. For these all purposes, we propose a new healthcare monitoring system to monitor the disease level by predicting the diseases according to the original data that are collected from the patients who are available in remote places. Moreover, we propose a secured data storage model for storing the patient's data securely in cloud databases. Here, we introduce two new cryptographic algorithms for performing encryption and decryption processes. The experiments have been conducted for evaluating the performance of health monitoring system according to the particular diseases such as heart and diabetic diseases. This work considered the UCI medical dataset and the data collected from patients whose are available remotely through IoT devices. The proposed system is evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the existing e-healthcare systems.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a stage between cognitive normal (CN) and AD. Although timely diagnosis is the key to treatment, the conventional diagnostic methods make periodic diagnosis impossible due to various issues, such as pain and cost. Therefore, we propose a method for early diagnosing by focusing on gait, which is safe and efficient. Seven wearable devices with a built-in inertial measurement unit were used to collect gait data from 145 subjects, and seven gait experiment paradigms, including multilevel subtasks, were developed to clarify the characteristics of gait of each severity. Based on the acquired gait datasets, we proposed a machine learning (ML)-based classification model-an elimination method-based ensemble and oversampling model-which is applied to our proposed method. Experimental results show that our proposed model is effective in detecting the early stages of AD and demonstrate the potential of using an auxiliary diagnostic tool.

AB  - Survival prediction is highly valued in end-of-life care clinical practice, and patient performance status evaluation stands as a predominant component in survival prognostication. While current performance status evaluation tools are limited to their subjective nature, the advent of wearable technology enables continual recordings of patients' activity and has the potential to measure performance status objectively. We hypothesize that wristband actigraphy monitoring devices can predict in-hospital death of end-stage cancer patients during the time of their hospital admissions. The objective of this study was to train and validate a long short-term memory (LSTM) deep-learning prediction model based on activity data of wearable actigraphy devices. The study recruited 60 end-stage cancer patients in a hospice care unit, with 28 deaths and 32 discharged in stable condition at the end of their hospital stay. The standard Karnofsky Performance Status score had an overall prognostic accuracy of 0.83. The LSTM prediction model based on patients' continual actigraphy monitoring had an overall prognostic accuracy of 0.83. Furthermore, the model performance improved with longer input data length up to 48 h. In conclusion, our research suggests the potential feasibility of wristband actigraphy to predict end-of-life admission outcomes in palliative care for end-stage cancer patients.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to develop a deep learning-based classification model for early detection of dementia using a wearable device that can measure the electrical conductivity of the skin, temperature, and movement as factors related to dementia, interlocking them with an application, and analyzing the collected data. Methods This study was conducted on 18 elderly individuals (5 males, 13 females) aged 65 years or older who consented to the study. The Korean Mini-Mental State Examination survey for cognitive function tests was conducted by well-trained researchers. The subjects were first grouped into high- or low-risk group for dementia based on their Korean Mini-Mental State Examination score. Data obtained by wearable devices of each subject were then used for the classification of the high- and low-risk groups of dementia through a smart healthcare-based system implementing a deep neural network with scaled principal component analysis. The correlation coefficients between the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination score and the featured data were also investigated. Results Our study showed that the proposed system using a deep neural network with scaled principal component analysis was effective in detecting individuals at high risk for dementia with up to 99% accuracy and which performance was better compared with commonly used classification algorithms. In addition, it was found that the electrical conductivity of skin had the closest correlation with the results of the Korean Mini-Mental State Examination score among data collected through wearable devices in this study. Conclusions Our proposed system can contribute to effective early detection of dementia for the elderly, using a non-invasive and easy-to-wear wearable device and classification algorithms with a simple cognitive function test. In the future, we intend to have more subjects participate in the experiment, to include more relevant variables in the wearable device, and to analyze the effectiveness of the smart healthcare-based dementia classification system over the long term.

AB  - Nowadays, there is a growing need for Internet of Things (IoT)-based mobile healthcare applications that help to predict diseases. In recent years, several people have been diagnosed with diabetes, and according to World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes affects 346 million individuals worldwide. Therefore, we propose a noninvasive self-care system based on the IoT and machine learning (ML) that analyses blood sugar and other key indicators to predict diabetes early. The main purpose of this work is to develop enhanced diabetes management applications which help in patient monitoring and technology-assisted decision-making. The proposed hybrid ensemble ML model predicts diabetes mellitus by combining both bagging and boosting methods. An online IoT-based application and offline questionnaire with 15 questions about health, family history, and lifestyle were used to recruit a total of 10221 people for the study. For both datasets, the experimental findings suggest that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - Physical health plays an important role in overall well-being of the human beings. It is the most observed dimension of health among others such as social, intellectual, emotional, spiritual and environmental dimensions. Due to exponential increase in the development of wireless communication techniques, Internet of Things (IoT) has effectively penetrated different aspects of human lives. Healthcare is one of the dynamic domains with ever-growing demands which can be met by IoT applications. IoT can be leveraged through several health service offerings such as remote health and monitoring services, aided living, personalized treatment, and so on. In this scenario, Deep Learning (DL) models are employed in proficient disease diagnosis. The cur-rent research work presents a new IoT-based physical health monitoring and management method using optimal Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder (SSDA) technique i.e., OSSDA. The proposed model utilizes a set of IoT devices to collect the data from patients. Imbalanced class problem poses serious challenges during disease diagnosis process. So, the OSSDA model includes Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate artificial minority class instances to balance the class distribution. Further, the hyperparameter settings of the OSSDA model exhibit heavy influence upon the classification performance of SSDA technique. The number of hidden layers, sparsity, and noise count are determined by Sailfish Optimizer (SFO). In order to validate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed OSSDA technique, a set of experiments was conducted on diabetes and heart disease datasets. The simulation results portrayed a proficient diagnostic outcome from OSSDA technique over other methods. The proposed method achieved the highest accuracy values i.e., 0.9604 and 0.9548 on the applied heart disease and diabetes datasets respectively.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the pregnancy complications that poses a significant risk on mothers and babies as well. GDM usually diagnosed at 22-26 of gestation. However, the early prediction is desirable as it may contribute to decrease the risk. The continuous monitoring for mother's vital signs helps in predicting any deterioration during pregnancy. The originality of this paper is to provide comprehensive framework for pregnancy women monitoring. The proposed Data Replacement and Prediction Framework consists of three layers which are: (i) IoT Layer, (ii) Fog Layer, and (iii) Cloud Layer. The first layer used IOT sensors to aggregate vital sings from pregnancies using invasive and noninvasive sensors. Then the vital signs transmitted to fog nodes to processed and finally stored in the cloud layer. The main contribution in this paper is located in the fog layer producing GDM module to implement two influential tasks which are: (i) Data Finding Methodology (DFM), and (ii) Explainable Prediction Algorithm (EPM) using DNN. First, the DFM is used to replace the unused data to free the cache space for the new incoming data items. The cache replacement is very important in the case of healthcare system as the incoming vital signs are frequent and must be replaced continuously. Second, the EPM is used to predict the incidence of GDM that may occur in the second trimester of the pregnancy. To evaluate our model, we extract data of 16,354 pregnancy women from medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC III) benchmark dataset. For each woman, vital signs, demographic data and laboratory tests was aggregated. The results of the prediction model superior the state of the art (ACC = 0.957, AUC = 0.942). Regarding to explainability, we utilized Shapley additive explanation framework to provide local and global explanation for the developed models. Overall, the proposed framework is medically intuitive, allow the early prediction of GDM with cost effective solution.

AB  - The incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cardiovascular burden (the number of deaths) are continuously rising worldwide. Heart disease leads to heart failure (HF) in affected patients. Therefore any additional aid to current medical support systems is crucial for the clinician to forecast the survival status for these patients. The collaborative use of machine learning and IoT devices has become very important in today's intelligent healthcare systems. This paper presents a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) secured IoT enabled framework entitled Cardiac Diagnostic Feature and Demographic Identification (CDF-DI) systems with significant Models that recognize several Cardiac disease features related to HF. To achieve this goal, we used statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the Cardiac secondary dataset. The Elevated Serum Creatinine (SC) levels and Serum Sodium (SS) could cause renal problems and are well established in HF patients. The Mann Whitney U test found that SC and SS levels affected the survival status of patients (p < 0.05). Anemia, diabetes, and BP features had no significant impact on the SS and SC level in the patient (p > 0.05). The Cox regression model also found a significant association of age group with the survival status using follow-up months. Furthermore, the present study also proposed important features of Cardiac disease that identified the patient's survival status, age group, and gender. The most prominent algorithm was the Random Forest (RF) suggesting five key features to determine the survival status of the patient with an accuracy of 96%: Follow-up months, SC, Ejection Fraction (EF), Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK), and platelets. Additionally, the RF selected five prominent features (smoking habits, CPK, platelets, follow-up month, and SC) in recognition of gender with an accuracy of 94%. Moreover, the five vital features such as CPK, SC, follow-up month, platelets, and EF were found to be significant predictors for the patient's age group with an accuracy of 96%. The Kaplan Meier plot revealed that mortality was high in the extremely old age group (chi(2) (1) = 8.565). The recommended features have possible effects on clinical practice and would be supportive aid to the existing medical support system to identify the possibility of the survival status of the heart patient. The doctor should primarily concentrate on the follow-up month, SC, EF, CPK, and platelet count for the patient's survival in the situation.

AB  - In this paper, we present a deep learning framework "Rehab-Net" for effectively classifying three upper limb movements of the human arm, involving extension, flexion, and rotation of the forearm, which, over the time, could provide a measure of rehabilitation progress. The proposed framework, Rehab-Net is formulated with a personalized, light weight and low-complex, customized convolutional neural network (CNN) model, using two-layers of CNN, interleaved with pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer that classifies the three movements from tri-axial acceleration input data collected from the wrist. The proposed Rehab-Net framework was validated on sensor data collected in two situations: 1) semi-naturalistic environment involving an archetypal activity of "making-tea" with four stroke survivors and 2) natural environment, where ten stroke survivors were free to perform any desired arm movement for the duration of 120 min. We achieved an overall accuracy of 97.89% on semi-naturalistic data and 88.87% on naturalistic data which exceeded state-of-the-art learning algorithms namely, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and k-means clustering with an average accuracy of 48.89%, 44.14%, and 27.64%. Subsequently, a computational complexity analysis of the proposed model has been discussed with an eye toward hardware implementation. The clinical significance of this study is to accurately monitor the clinical progress of the rehabilitated subjects under the ambulatory settings.

AB  - Heart disease, caused by low heart rate, is one of the most significant causes of mortality in the world today. Therefore, it is critical to monitor heart health by identifying the deviation in the heart rate very early, which makes it easier to detect and manage the heart's function irregularities at a very early stage. The fast-growing use of advanced technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT), wearable monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) in the healthcare systems has continued to play a vital role in the analysis of huge amounts of health-based data for early and accurate disease detection and diagnosis for personalized treatment and prognosis evaluation. It is then important to analyze the effectiveness of using data analytics and machine learning to monitor and predict heart rates using wearable device (accelerometer)-generated data. Hence, in this study, we explored a number of powerful data-driven models including the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, linear regression, support vector regression (SVR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN) regressor, decision tree regressor, random forest regressor and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network algorithm for the analysis of accelerometer data to make future HR predictions from the accelerometer's univariant HR time-series data from healthy people. The performances of the models were evaluated under different durations. Evaluated on a very recently created data set, our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using an ARIMA model with a walk-forward validation and linear regression for predicting heart rate under all durations and other models for durations longer than 1 min. The results of this study show that employing these data analytics techniques can be used to predict future HR more accurately using accelerometers.

AB  - In recent days, Internet of Things (IoT) based image classification technique in the healthcare services is becoming a familiar concept that supports the process of detecting cancers with Computer Tomography (CT) images. Lung cancer is one of the perilous diseases that increases the mortality rate exponentially. IoT based image classifiers have the ability to detect cancer at an early stage and increases the life span of a patient. It supports oncologist to monitor and evaluate the health condition of a patient. Also, it can decipher cancer risk marker and act upon them. The process of feature extraction and selection from CT images plays a key role in identifying cancer hot spots. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the efficient feature extraction techniques that improves the performance of image classifier by reducing the entropy of image data sets. A Random Forest (RF) classifier is a machine learning technique that can improve its efficiency with the support of CNN. This paper presents an RF classifier with CNN based technique to improve the percentage of accuracy in detecting cancer hot spots with CT images. The experimentation of the proposed approach is based on three dimensions: Feature extraction, selection, and prediction of cancer hot spots. To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, benchmark image repositories which consists of 3954 images and 50 low dose whole lungs CT scan images are employed. The proposed method achieves an effective result on all test images under different aspects. Consequently, it obtains an average accuracy of 93.25% and an F-measure of 91.75% which is higher than the other methods, comparatively.

AB  - BackgroundDespite technological advancement in the field of healthcare, the worldwide burden of illness caused by cardio-vascular diseases (CVDs) is rising, owing mostly to a sharp increase in developing nations that are undergoing fast health transitions. People have been experimenting with techniques to extend their lives since ancient times. Despite this, technology is still a long way from attaining the aim of lowering mortality rates.MethodsFrom methodological perspective, a design Science Research (DSR) approach is adopted in this research. As such, to investigate the current healthcare and interaction systems created for predicting cardiac disease for patients, we first analyzed the body of existing literature. After that, a conceptual framework of the system was designed using the gathered requirements. Based on the conceptual framework, the development of different components of the system was completed. Finally, the evaluation study procedure was developed taking into account the effectiveness, usability and efficiency of the developed system.ResultsTo attain the objectives, we proposed a system consisting of a wearable device and mobile application, which allows the users to know their risk levels of having CVDs in the future. The Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques were adopted to develop the system that can classify its users into three risk levels (high, moderate and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 80.4% and two risk levels (high and low risk of having CVD) with an F1 score of 91%. The stacking classifier incorporating best-performing ML algorithms was used for predicting the risk levels of the end-users utilizing the UCI Repository dataset.ConclusionThe resultant system allows the users to check and monitor their possibility of having CVD in near future using real-time data. Also, the system was evaluated from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) point of view. Thus, the created system offers a promising resolution to the current biomedical sector.

AB  - Machine learning applications in cardiology have rapidly evolved in the past decade. With the availability of machine learning tools coupled with vast data sources, the management of atrial fibrillation (AF), a common chronic disease with significant associated morbidity and socioeconomic impact, is undergoing a knowledge and practice transformation in the increasingly complex healthcare environment. Among other advances, deep-learning machine learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, have enabled the development of AF screening pathways using the ubiquitous 12-lead ECG to detect asymptomatic paroxysmal AF in at-risk populations (such as those with cryptogenic stroke), the refinement of AF and stroke prediction schemes through comprehensive digital phenotyping using structured and unstructured data abstraction from the electronic health record or wearable monitoring technologies, and the optimization of treatment strategies, ranging from stroke prophylaxis to monitoring of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Although the clinical and population-wide impact of these tools continues to be elucidated, such transformative progress does not come without challenges, such as the concerns about adopting black box technologies, assessing input data quality for training such models, and the risk of perpetuating rather than alleviating health disparities. This review critically appraises the advances of machine learning related to the care of AF thus far, their potential future directions, and its potential limitations and challenges.

AB  - Objective To determine whether a machine learning model can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection from physiological metrics collected from wearable devices. Materials and Methods Health care workers from 7 hospitals were enrolled and prospectively followed in a multicenter observational study. Subjects downloaded a custom smart phone app and wore Apple Watches for the duration of the study period. Daily surveys related to symptoms and the diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 were answered in the app. Results We enrolled 407 participants with 49 (12%) having a positive nasal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test during follow-up. We examined 5 machine-learning approaches and found that gradient-boosting machines (GBM) had the most favorable validation performance. Across all testing sets, our GBM model predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) = 86.4% (confidence interval [CI] 84-89%). The model was calibrated to value sensitivity over specificity, achieving an average sensitivity of 82% (CI +/-similar to 4%) and specificity of 77% (CI +/-similar to 1%). The most important predictors included parameters describing the circadian heart rate variability mean (MESOR) and peak-timing (acrophase), and age. Discussion We show that a tree-based ML algorithm applied to physiological metrics passively collected from a wearable device can identify and predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion Applying machine learning models to the passively collected physiological metrics from wearable devices may improve SARS-CoV-2 screening methods and infection tracking.
   Lay Summary The goal of the study is to determine if SARS-CoV-2 infections, which cause Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), can be detected using machine learning algorithms applied to the information collected by wearable devices. Four hundred and nine health care workers were enrolled from 7 hospitals in New York City. Participants downloaded a custom smart phone application and were provided with an Apple Watch, if they did not have one of their own. Daily questions collected information from participants about how they feel and whether they were diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that a type of machine learning algorithm, called gradient boosting machines was able to reliably predict severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections by combining various metrics collected from the Apple Watch. We found markers of heart rate variability, or the calculation of the small-time differences between each heartbeat, to be important in identifying infections. These findings demonstrate that wearable devices may improve screening for SARS-CoV-2 infections and the overall tracking of infections.

AB  - Mobile clouds are the most common medium for aggregating, storing, and analyzing data from the medical Internet of Things (MIoT). It is employed to monitor a patient's essential health signs for earlier disease diagnosis and prediction. Among the various disease, skin cancer was the wide variety of cancer, as well as enhances the endurance rate. In recent years, many skin cancer classification systems using machine and deep learning models have been developed for classifying skin tumors, including malignant melanoma (MM) and other skin cancers. However, accurate cancer detection was not performed with minimum time consumption. In order to address these existing problems, a novel Multidimensional Bregman Divergencive Feature Scaling Based Cophenetic Piecewise Regression Recurrent Deep Learning Classification (MBDFS-CPRRDLC) technique is introduced for detecting cancer at an earlier stage. The MBDFS-CPRRDLC performs skin cancer detection using different layers such as input, hidden, and output for feature selection and classification. The patient information is composed of IoT. The patient information was stored in mobile clouds server for performing predictive analytics. The collected data are sent to the recurrent deep learning classifier. In the first hidden layer, the feature selection process is carried out using the Multidimensional Bregman Divergencive Feature Scaling technique to find the significant features for disease identification resulting in decreases time consumption. Followed by, the disease classification is carried out in the second hidden layer using cophenetic correlative piecewise regression for analyzing the testing and training data. This process is repeatedly performed until the error gets minimized. In this way, disease classification is accurately performed with higher accuracy. Experimental evaluation is carried out for factors namely Accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, as well as cancer detection time, by the amount of patient data. The observed result confirms that the proposed MBDFS-CPRRDLC technique increases accuracy as well as lesser cancer detection time compared to the conventional approaches.

AB  - Systems developed to work with computational intelligence have become very efficient, and in some cases obtain more accurate results than evaluations by humans. Hence, this work proposes a new online approach based on deep learning tools according to the concept of transfer learning to generate a computational intelligence framework for use with the Internet of Health Things (IoHT) devices. This framework allows the user to add their images and perform platform training almost as easily as creating folders and placing files in regular cloud storage services. The trials carried out with the tool showed that even people with no programming and image processing knowledge were able to set up projects in a few minutes. The proposed approach is validated using three medical databases, which include cerebral vascular accident images for stroke type classification, lung nodule images for malignant classification, and skin images for the classification of melanocytic lesions. The results show the efficiency and reliability of the framework, which reached 91.6% Accuracy in the stroke images and lung nodules databases, and 92% Accuracy in the skin images databases. This prove the immense contribution that this work can bring to assist medical professionals in analyzing complex examinations quickly and accurately, allowing a large medical examination database through a consolidated collaborative IoT platform.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) embed computation and communication capability into its core to regulate physical processes and seamlessly mediate between the cyber and the physical world for various control and monitoring tasks. Health CPS, a variant of CPS in the healthcare sector, acts as a health monitoring system to dynamically capture, process, and analyze health sensor data through integrated internet of things (IoT)-enabled cyber-physical processes. These systems can suitably support patients suffering from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or who are at risk of suffering from those. Identifying the risk of NCDs, such as heart disease and diabetes, requires artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into the core of health CPS. Recently, there has been growing interest to incorporate machine learning into CPS, which can facilitate the disease classification, detection, monitoring, and prediction of several NCDs. However, there is a shortage of visible work that focus on early-stage risk prediction of these diseases. In this work, we propose a novel machine learning based health CPS framework that addresses the challenge of effectively processing the wearable IoT sensor data for early risk prediction of diabetes as an example of NCDs. In the experiment, a verified diabetic dataset has been used for training, while the testing has been performed on an artificially generated data collection from sensors. The experiment with several machine learning algorithms shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving the maximum precision from the Random Tree algorithm, which requires a minimum time of 0.01s to construct a model and obtains 94% accuracy to predict the probability of diabetes at an early point.

AB  - Rapid increase in stroke incidence coupled with the high cost and limited availability of healthcare professionals has made stroke rehabilitation process inaccessible to many patients in developing countries. Stroke rehabilitation exercises are of critical importance in ensuring quick and lasting recovery. A machine learning-based system that can automatically identify the completion status of upper limb rehabilitation exercises is presented in this study. Proposed system can detect completion status of twelve hand and arm rehabilitation exercises: six hand, four forearm and two shoulder exercises. Accelerometers record the movement of the upper limb part being exercised in the form of data sequences. Six curve-fitting-based machine learning model types are trained and evaluated for their effectiveness in modelling these sequences. This resulted in a total of 216 models (i.e. 12 exercises x 3 axes of motion x 6 model types) being evaluated on three performance measures: SSE, RMSE and R-2. Best-performing model for each exercise is plugged into the proposed exercise completion status identification algorithm. System effectiveness is validated using four performance measures: accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Proposed system is demonstrated to be capable of detecting the exercise completion status with up to 90% accuracy. The proposed system is connected to cloud via an IoT interface with a dashboard type visualization system that allows for the healthcare professionals to remotely monitor the progress for each patient as well as carry out offline analysis. A game interaction interface is also provided to enable interaction with video games, helping in higher patient engagement while performing exercises.

AB  - Background: Monitoring eating is central to the care of many conditions such as diabetes, eating disorders, heart diseases, and dementia. However, automatic tracking of eating in a free-living environment remains a challenge because of the lack of a mature system and large-scale, reliable training set.
   Objective: This study aims to fill in this gap by an integrative engineering and machine learning effort and conducting a large-scale study in terms of monitoring hours on wearable-based eating detection.
   Methods: This prospective, longitudinal, passively collected study, covering 3828 hours of records, was made possible by programming a digital system that streams diary, accelerometer, and gyroscope data from Apple Watches to iPhones and then transfers the data to the cloud.
   Results: On the basis of this data collection, we developed deep learning models leveraging spatial and time augmentation and inferring eating at an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.825 within 5 minutes in the general population. In addition, the longitudinal follow-up of the study design encouraged us to develop personalized models that detect eating behavior at an AUC of 0.872. When aggregated to individual meals, the AUC is 0.951. We then prospectively collected an independent validation cohort in a different season of the year and validated the robustness of the models (0.941 for meal-level aggregation).
   Conclusions: The accuracy of this model and the data streaming platform promises immediate deployment for monitoring eating in applications such as diabetic integrative care.

AB  - Identifying the symptoms of the early stages of dementia is a difficult task, particularly for older adults living in residential care. Internet of Things (IoT) and smart environments can assist with the early detection of dementia, by nonintrusive monitoring of the daily activities of the older adults. In this work, we focus on the daily life activities of adults in a smart home setting to discover their potential cognitive anomalies using a public dataset. After analysing the dataset, extracting the features, and selecting distinctive features based on dynamic ranking, a classification model is built. We compare and contrast several machine learning approaches for developing a reliable and efficient model to identify the cognitive status of monitored adults. Using our predictive model and our approach of distinctive feature selection, we have achieved 90.74% accuracy in detecting the onset of dementia.

AB  - In order to solve the shortcomings of the current clinical scale assessment for stroke patients, such as excessive time consumption, strong subjectivity, and coarse grading, this study designed an intelligent rehabilitation assessment system based on wearable devices and a machine learning algorithm and explored the effectiveness of the system in assessing patients' rehabilitation outcomes. The accuracy and effectiveness of the intelligent rehabilitation assessment system were verified by comparing the consistency and time between the designed intelligent rehabilitation assessment system scores and the clinical Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) scores. A total of 120 stroke patients from two hospitals participated as volunteers in the trial study, and statistical analyses of the two assessment methods were performed. The results showed that the R-2 of the total score regression analysis for both methods was 0.9667, 95% CI 0.92-0.98, p < 0.001, and the mean of the deviation was 0.30, 95% CI 0.57-1.17. The percentages of deviations/relative deviations falling within the mean +/- 1.96 SD of deviations/relative deviations were 92.50% and 95.83%, respectively. The mean time for system assessment was 35.00% less than that for clinician assessment, p < 0.05. Therefore, wearable intelligent machine learning rehabilitation assessment has a strong and significant correlation with clinician assessment, and the time spent is significantly reduced, which provides an accurate, objective, and effective solution for clinical rehabilitation assessment and remote rehabilitation without the presence of physicians.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease is a general phrase that indicates that it is working abnormally. Babies can also have congenital heart disease. Each and everyday people affected by heart disease is increasing in number. Still, it is one which is prevailing among people, regardless of their age. This kind of disease is common for both men and women. So the prediction of this disease in an efficient manner is the most challenging duty. Heart rate classification is done by electrocardiogram (ECG) and many new IoT techniques, but something great can be achieved by using machine learning (ML) algorithms. Machine Learning is efficient in predicting heart diseases. This information can provide essential information to doctors to carry out on their diagnosis for patients. Machine learning helps us to achieve by resulting in the greatest accuracy rate. By taking this into account, we are focusing on learning techniques for prediction of heart disease. In ML, particularly we are focusing on the AdaBoost classifier to get good results. Adaptive boost (AdaBoost), a meta-learning algorithm which comes under ML techniques. It can be used in conjunction with some other types of learning algorithms for improving performance. Thus by using AdaBoost classifier, it achieved 98% of accuracy.

AB  - Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings generate an electrical map of the human brain that are useful for clinical inspection of patients and in biomedical smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) and BrainComputer Interface (BCI) applications. From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected into the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from delta, theta, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multimodal (CWT+BiS) features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently, our proposed multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable alternative to state-of-the-art computationally intensive deep learning approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, the information related to heart disease using IoT wearable devices is collected from any benchmark site, which is publicly available. With the collected data, feature extraction process is performed initially, in which heart rate, zero crossing rate, and higher order statistical features like standard deviation, median, skewness, kurtosis, variance, mean, peak amplitude, and entropy are extracted. For acquiring most significant features, the optimal feature selection process is implemented. As a novel contribution, the feature selection process is done by the hybrid optimization algorithm called PS-GWO by integrating GWO and PSO. Next, the extracted features are subjected to a famous deep learning algorithm named modified DBN, in which the activation function and number of hidden neurons is optimized using the same developed hybrid algorithm to improve the heart diagnosis accuracy. From the analysis, for the test case 1, the accuracy of the developed PS-GWO-DBN is 60%, 52.5%, 35% and 35% increased than NN, KNN, SVM, and DBN. For test case 2, the accuracy of the proposed PS-GWO-DBN is 26%, 24%, 21.6% and 17% increased than NN, KNN, SVM, and DBN, respectively. The accuracy of the designed PS-GWO-DBN is 26% advanced than NN, 24% advanced than KNN, 21.6% advanced than SVM and 17% advanced than DBN for test case 3. Thus, the proposed heart disease prediction model using PS-GWO-DBN performs better than other classifiers.

AB  - Simple Summary Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters is crucial in mammography, which reduces disease consequences and initiates treatment at an early stage. A misinterpretation of mammography may lead to an unneeded biopsy of the false-positive results, decreasing the patient's chances of survival. This study aims to increase the probability of early breast mass identification to ensure better treatment and minimize mortality risk. However, this study proposes a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks to extract features of varying densities and classify normal and suspicious mammography regions. Two different experiments were carried out to validate the consistency of diagnoses and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks. Additionally, the deep features extracted are used to train the support vector machine algorithm, resulting in an outstanding performance in the second experiment. Furthermore, this study confirms an improvement in mass recognition accuracy through data cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation. Our deep learning hybrid model obtained a classification accuracy of 97.8%, outperforming the current state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed model's improvements are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist's strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients' mammography images. Background: Diagnosing breast cancer masses and calcification clusters have paramount significance in mammography, which aids in mitigating the disease's complexities and curing it at early stages. However, a wrong mammogram interpretation may lead to an unnecessary biopsy of the false-positive findings, which reduces the patient's survival chances. Consequently, approaches that learn to discern breast masses can reduce the number of misconceptions and incorrect diagnoses. Conventionally used classification models focus on feature extraction techniques specific to a particular problem based on domain information. Deep learning strategies are becoming promising alternatives to solve the many challenges of feature-based approaches. Methods: This study introduces a convolutional neural network (ConvNet)-based deep learning method to extract features at varying densities and discern mammography's normal and suspected regions. Two different experiments were carried out to make an accurate diagnosis and classification. The first experiment consisted of five end-to-end pre-trained and fine-tuned deep convolution neural networks (DCNN). The in-depth features extracted from the ConvNet are also used to train the support vector machine algorithm to achieve excellent performance in the second experiment. Additionally, DCNN is the most frequently used image interpretation and classification method, including VGGNet, GoogLeNet, MobileNet, ResNet, and DenseNet. Moreover, this study pertains to data cleaning, preprocessing, and data augmentation, and improving mass recognition accuracy. The efficacy of all models is evaluated by training and testing three mammography datasets and has exhibited remarkable results. Results: Our deep learning ConvNet+SVM model obtained a discriminative training accuracy of 97.7% and validating accuracy of 97.8%, contrary to this, VGGNet16 method yielded 90.2%, 93.5% for VGGNet19, 63.4% for GoogLeNet, 82.9% for MobileNetV2, 75.1% for ResNet50, and 72.9% for DenseNet121.
   Conclusions: The proposed model's improvement and validation are appropriated in conventional pathological practices that conceivably reduce the pathologist's strain in predicting clinical outcomes by analyzing patients' mammography images.

AB  - Blood glucose (BG) prediction is essential to the success of glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1D) management. Empowered by the recent development of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and deep learning technologies have been demonstrated to achieve the state of the art in BG prediction. However, it is challenging to implement such algorithms in actual clinical settings to provide persistent decision support due to the high demand for computational resources, while smartphone-based implementations are limited by short battery life and require users to carry the device. In this work, we propose a new deep learning model using an attention-based evidential recurrent neural network and design an IoMT-enabled wearable device to implement the embedded model, which comprises a low-cost and low-power system on a chip to perform Bluetooth connectivity and edge computing for real-time BG prediction and predictive hypoglycemia detection. In addition, we developed a smartphone app to visualize BG trajectories and predictions, and desktop and cloud platforms to backup data and fine-tune models. The embedded model was evaluated on three clinical data sets including 47 T1D subjects. The proposed model achieved superior performance of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error, and glucose-specific RMSE, and obtained the best accuracy for hypoglycemia detection when compared with a group of machine learning baseline methods. Moreover, we performed hardware-in-the-loop in silico trials with ten virtual T1D adults to test the whole IoMT system with predictive low-glucose management, which significantly reduced hypoglycemia and improved BG control.

AB  - Dietary patterns can be the primary reason for many chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity. State-of-the-art wearable sensor technologies can play a critical role in assisting patients in managing their eating habits by providing meaningful statistics on critical parameters such as the onset, duration, and frequency of eating. For an accurate yet fast food intake recognition, this work presents a novel Machine Learning (ML) based framework that shows promising results by leveraging optimized support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The SVM classifiers are trained on three comprehensive datasets: OREBA, FIC, and CLEMSON. The developed framework outperforms existing algorithms by achieving F1-scores of 92%, 94%, 95%, and 85% on OREBA-SHA, OREBA-DIS, FIC, and CLEMSON datasets, respectively. In order to assess the generalization aspects, the proposed SVM framework is also trained on one of the three databases while being tested on the others and achieves acceptable F1-scores in all cases. The proposed algorithm is well suited for real-time applications since inference is made using a few support vector parameters compared to thousands in peer deep neural networks models.

AB  - These days cloud-based infrastructure is facing many challenges, out of which the major issue is their syncing data before cutover and data migration. Due to the limited scalability in terms of security concerns of cloud computing, the need for a centralized IoTs based environment has been constrained to a limited extent. The sensitivity of device latency emerged during healthy systems such as health monitoring, etc. is the main reason, because healthy systems require computing operations on high-volume data. Fog computing provides an innovative solution to improve the performance of cloud computing, providing the ability to take the necessary resources and those that are closer to the end-users. Existing fog computing models retain several limitations, such as either considering result accuracy or overestimating response time, but managing both together impairs system compatibility. FETCH is a proposed framework that integrates with edge computing devices to work on deep learning technology and automated monitoring and offers a highly useful framework for real-life health care systems such as heart disease and more. The proposed Fog-enabled cloud computing framework uses FogBus, which demonstrates utility in the form of consumption of power, network bandwidth, jitter, latency, process execution time, and their accuracy as well.

AB  - Heart disease (HD) has surpassed all other causes of death in recent years. Estimating one's risk of developing heart disease is difficult, since it takes both specialized knowledge and practical experience. The collection of sensor information for the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiac disease is a recent application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in healthcare organizations. Despite the efforts of many scientists, the diagnostic results for HD remain unreliable. To solve this problem, we offer an IoT platform that uses a Modified Self-Adaptive Bayesian algorithm (MSABA) to provide more precise assessments of HD. When the patient wears the smartwatch and pulse sensor device, it records vital signs, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and blood pressure, and sends the data to a computer. The MSABA is used to determine whether the sensor data that has been obtained is normal or abnormal. To retrieve the features, the kernel discriminant analysis (KDA) is used. By contrasting the suggested MSABA with existing models, we can summarize the system's efficacy. Findings like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 measures show that the suggested MSABA-based prediction system outperforms competing approaches. The suggested method demonstrates that the MSABA achieves the highest rate of accuracy compared to the existing classifiers for the largest possible amount of data.

AB  - Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), common in the general and patient population, are irregular heartbeats that indicate potential heart diseases. Clinically, long-term electrocardiograms (ECG) collected from the wearable device is a non-invasive and inexpensive tool widely used to diagnose PVCs by physicians. However, analyzing these long-term ECG is time-consuming and labor-intensive for cardiologists. Therefore, this paper proposed a simplistic but powerful approach to detect PVC from long-term ECG. The suggested method utilized deep metric learning to extract features, with compact intra-product variance and separated inter-product differences, from the heartbeat. Subsequently, the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier calculated the distance between samples based on these features to detect PVC. Unlike previous systems used to detect PVC, the proposed process can intelligently and automatically extract features by supervised deep metric learning, which can avoid the bias caused by manual feature engineering. As a generally available set of standard test material, the MIT-BIH (Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital) Arrhythmia Database is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the experiment takes 99.7% accuracy, 97.45% sensitivity, and 99.87% specificity. The simulation events show that it is reliable to use deep metric learning and KNN for PVC recognition. More importantly, the overall way does not rely on complicated and cumbersome preprocessing.

AB  - Background: Wearable devices have evolved as screening tools for atrial fibrillation (AF). A photoplethysmographic (PPG) AF detection algorithm was developed and applied to a convenient smartphone-based device with good accuracy. However, patients with paroxysmal AF frequently exhibit premature atrial complexes (PACs), which result in poor unmanned AF detection, mainly because of rule-based or handcrafted machine learning techniques that are limited in terms of diagnostic accuracy and reliability.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop deep learning (DL) classifiers using PPG data to detect AF from the sinus rhythm (SR) in the presence of PACs after successful cardioversion.
   Methods: We examined 75 patients with AF who underwent successful elective direct-current cardioversion (DCC). Electrocardiogram and pulse oximetry data over a 15-min period were obtained before and after DCC and labeled as AF or SR. A 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) were chosen as the 2 DL architectures. The PAC indicator estimated the burden of PACs on the PPG dataset We defined a metric called the confidence level (CL) of AF or SR diagnosis and compared the CLs of true and false diagnoses. We also compared the diagnostic performance of 1D-CNN and RNN with previously developed AF detectors (support vector machine with root-mean-square of successive difference of RR intervals and Shannon entropy, autocorrelation, and ensemble by combining 2 previous methods) using 10 5-fold cross-validation processes.
   Results: Among the 14,298 training samples containing PPG data, 7157 samples were obtained during the post-DCC period. The PAC indicator estimated 29.79% (2132/7157) of post-DCC samples had PACs. The diagnostic accuracy of AF versus SR was 99.32% (70,925/71,410) versus 95.85% (68,602/71,570) in 1D-CNN and 98.27% (70,176/71,410) versus 96.04% (68,736/71,570) in RNN methods. The area under receiver operating characteristic curves of the 2 DL classifiers was 0.998 (95% CI 0.995-1.000) for 1D-CNN and 0.996 (95% CI 0.993-0.998) for RNN, which were significantly higher than other AF detectors (P<.001). If we assumed that the dataset could emulate a sufficient number of patients in training, both DL classifiers improved their diagnostic performances even further especially for the samples with a high burden of PACs. The average CLs for true versus false classification were 98.56% versus 78.75% for 1D-CNN and 98.37% versus 82.57% for RNN (P<.001 for all cases).
   Conclusions: New DL classifiers could detect AF using PPG monitoring signals with high diagnostic accuracy even with frequent PACs and could outperform previously developed AF detectors. Although diagnostic performance decreased as the burden of PACs increased, performance improved when samples from more patients were trained. Moreover, the reliability of the diagnosis could be indicated by the CL. Wearable devices sensing PPG signals with DL classifiers should be validated as tools to screen for AF.

AB  - The heart attack happens if the flow of blood leads to blocks in any of the blood veins and vessels liable for delivering blood into internal parts of the heart. In the modern life activities and habits, the males and females hold the same responsibility and burden of risk. The absence of understanding frequently leads to a postponement in dealing with the heart attack issues, which could worsen the injury and in most of the situations shown to be dead. Several researchers have applied data mining techniques to diagnose illnesses, and the results have been encouraging. Some methods forecast a specific illness, whereas others predict a wide spectrum of illnesses. In addition, the accuracy of sickness predictions can be improved. This post went into great length on the many approaches of data classification that are currently available. Algorithms primarily represent themselves through representations. Data classification is a typical but computationally intensive task in the area of information technology. A huge amount of data must be analysed in order to come up with an effective plan for fighting disease. Metaheuristics are frequently employed to tackle optimization issues. The accuracy of computing models can be improved by using metaheuristic techniques. Early disease diagnosis, severity evaluation, and prediction are all popular uses for artificial intelligence. For the sake of patients, health care costs, and slowed course of disease, this is a good idea. Machine learning approaches have been used to achieve this. Using machine learning and metaheuristics, this study attempts to classify and forecast human heart disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases are two neurodegenerative brain disorders affecting more than 50 million people globally. Early diagnosis and appropriate assessment of disease progression are critical for treatment and improving patients' health. Currently, the diagnosis of these neurodegenerative diseases is based primarily on mental status exams and neuroimaging scans, which are costly, time-consuming, and sometimes erroneous. Novel, cost-effective, and precise diagnostic tools and techniques are, thus, urgently required, particularly for early detection and prediction. In the recent decade, electromagnetic imaging has evolved as a cost-effective and noninvasive alternative approach for studying brain diseases. These studies focus on wearable and portable devices and imaging algorithms. However, microwave imaging cannot detect minimal changes in the brain at early stages accurately due to its lower resolution. This article investigates machine learning (ML) techniques for the early diagnosis of acute neurological diseases, especially Alzheimer's disease (AD). A machine-learning-based classification method is proposed. Simulations are performed on realistic numerical brain phantoms using the CST studio suite to get the scattered signals. A novel data augmentation method is proposed to generate synthetic data required for ML algorithms. A deep neural network-based autoencoder extracts features to train various ML algorithms. The classification results are compared with raw data and manual feature extraction. The study shows that the proposed ML-based method could be used to monitor AD at its early stages.

AB  - Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud usingWi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.

AB  - Patients with breast cancer are prone to serious health-related complications with higher mortality. The primary reason might be a misinterpretation of radiologists in recognizing suspicious lesions due to technical issues in imaging qualities and heterogeneous breast densities which increases the false-(positive and negative) ratio. Early intervention is significant in establishing an up-to-date prognosis process which can successfully mitigate complications of disease with higher recovery. The manual screening of breast abnormalities through traditional machine learning schemes misinterpret the inconsistent feature-extraction process which poses a problem, i.e., patients being called-back for biopsies to eliminates the suspicions. However, several deep learning-based methods have been developed for reliable breast cancer prognosis and classification but very few of them provided a comprehensive overview of lesions segmentation. This research focusses on providing benefits and risks of breast multi-imaging modalities, segmentation schemes, feature extraction, classification of breast abnormalities through state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This research also explores various well-known databases using "Breast Cancer" keyword to present a comprehensive survey on existing diagnostic schemes to open-up new research challenges for radiologists and researchers to intervene as early as possible to develop an efficient and reliable breast cancer prognosis system using prominent deep learning schemes.

AB  - Objective People are increasingly encouraged to self-manage their chronic conditions; however, many struggle to practise it effectively. Most studies that investigate patient work (ie, tasks involved in self-management and contexts influencing such tasks) rely on self-reports, which are subject to recall and other biases. Few studies use wearable cameras and deep learning to capture and classify patient work activities automatically. Materials and Methods We propose a deep learning approach to classify activities of patient work collected from wearable cameras, thereby studying self-management routines more effectively. Twenty-six people with type 2 diabetes and comorbidities wore a wearable camera for a day, generating more than 400 h of video across 12 daily activities. To classify these video images, a weighted ensemble network that combines Linear Discriminant Analysis, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, and Object Detection algorithms is developed. Performance of our model is assessed using Top-1 and Top-5 metrics, compared against manual classification conducted by 2 independent researchers. Results Across 12 daily activities, our model achieved on average the best Top-1 and Top-5 scores of 81.9 and 86.8, respectively. Our model also outperformed other non-ensemble techniques in terms of Top-1 and Top-5 scores for most activity classes, demonstrating the superiority of leveraging weighted ensemble techniques. Conclusions Deep learning can be used to automatically classify daily activities of patient work collected from wearable cameras with high levels of accuracy. Using wearable cameras and a deep learning approach can offer an alternative approach to investigate patient work, one not subjected to biases commonly associated with self-report methods.

AB  - BackgroundThe aim of a recent research project was the investigation of the mechanisms involved in the onset of type 2 diabetes in the absence of familiarity. This has led to the development of a computational model that recapitulates the aetiology of the disease and simulates the immunological and metabolic alterations linked to type-2 diabetes subjected to clinical, physiological, and behavioural features of prototypical human individuals.ResultsWe analysed the time course of 46,170 virtual subjects, experiencing different lifestyle conditions. We then set up a statistical model able to recapitulate the simulated outcomes.ConclusionsThe resulting machine learning model adequately predicts the synthetic dataset and can, therefore, be used as a computationally-cheaper version of the detailed mathematical model, ready to be implemented on mobile devices to allow self-assessment by informed and aware individuals.

AB  - A continuous heart disease monitoring system is one of the significant applications spec-ified by the Internet of Things (IoT). This goal might be achieved by combining sophisti-cated expert systems with extensive healthcare data on heart diseases. Several machine learning-based methods have recently been proven for predicting and diagnosing cardiac illness. However, these algorithms are unable to manage high-dimensional information due to the lack of a smart framework that can combine several sources to anticipate cardiac illness. The Fuzzy-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used in this work to present a unique IoT-enabled heart disease prediction method. The benchmark data for the experi-ment came from public sources and collected via wearable IoT devices. An improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) called Population and Fitness-based HHO (PF-HHO) is utilized to select the best features, with the objective function of correlation maximization within the same class and correlation minimization among different classes. The scientific contribu-tions of the health care monitoring system are depicted here that help to improve heart dis-ease healthcare efficiency and also it can be reducing the death rate in the current world. The important section of this persistent healthcare mode is the real-world monitoring sys-tem. The simulation outcomes proved that the recommended approach is more successful at predicting heart illness than existing technologies.CO 2022 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The current gold standard of gait diagnostics is dependent on large, expensive motion-capture laboratories and highly trained clinical and technical staff. Wearable sensor systems combined with machine learning may help to improve the accessibility of objective gait assessments in a broad clinical context. However, current algorithms lack flexibility and require large training datasets with tedious manual labelling of data. The current study tests the validity of a novel machine learning algorithm for automated gait partitioning of laboratory-based and sensor-based gait data. The developed artificial intelligence tool was used in patients with a central neurological lesion and severe gait impairments. To build the novel algorithm, 2% and 3% of the entire dataset (567 and 368 steps in total, respectively) were required for assessments with laboratory equipment and inertial measurement units. The mean errors of machine learning-based gait partitions were 0.021 s for the laboratory-based datasets and 0.034 s for the sensor-based datasets. Combining reinforcement learning with a deep neural network allows significant reduction in the size of the training datasets to <5%. The low number of required training data provides end-users with a high degree of flexibility. Non-experts can easily adjust the developed algorithm and modify the training library depending on the measurement system and clinical population.

AB  - Abnormal activity in daily life is a relatively common symptom of chronic diseases, such as dementia. There will probably be a variety of repetitive activities in dementia patients' daily life, such as repeated handling of objects and repeated packing of clothes. It is particularly important to recognize the daily activities of the elderly, which can be further used to predict and monitor chronic diseases. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical ensemble deep learning activity recognition approach with wearable sensors based on focal loss. Seven basic everyday life activities including cooking, keyboarding, reading, brushing teeth, washing one's face, washing dishes and writing are considered in order to show its performance. Based on hold-out cross-validation results on a dataset collected from elderly volunteers, the average accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score of our approach are 98.69%, 98.05%, 98.01% and 97.99%, respectively, in identifying the activities of daily life for the elderly.

AB  - ObjectiveContinuous physiological measurements during a laboratory-based exercise test can provide physiological biomarkers, such as heart rate (HR) and oxygen uptake (V?O-2) kinetics, that carry clinically relevant information. In contrast, it is not clear how continuous data generated by wearable devices during daily-life routines could provide meaningful biomarkers. We aimed to determine whether valid HR and V?O-2 kinetics can be obtained from measurements with wearable devices during outdoor walks in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). MethodsHR (Polar Belt) and V?O-2(METAMAX3B) were measured during 93 physical activity transitions performed by eight patients with COPD during three different outdoor walks (n(tr )= 77) and a 6-minute walk test (n(tr )= 16). HR and V?O-2 kinetics were calculated every time a participant started a walk, finished a walk or walked upstairs. HR and V?O-2 kinetics were considered valid if the response magnitude and model fit were adequate, and model parameters were reliable. ResultsContinuous measurements with wearable devices provided valid HR kinetics when COPD patients started or finished (range 63%-100%) the different outdoor walks and valid V?O-2 kinetics when they finished (range 63%-100%) an outdoor walk. The amount of valid kinetics and kinetic model performance was comparable between outdoor walks and a laboratory-based exercise test (p > .05). ConclusionWe envision that the presented approach could improve telemonitoring applications of patients with COPD by providing regular, unsupervised assessments of HR kinetics during daily-life routines. This could allow to early identify a decline in the patients' dynamic physiological functioning, physical fitness and/or health status.

AB  - Generally, patients with heart diseases enquire for medical services while sick. They will not experience sickness often until they reach the last stage of heart disease, and so the damages are not reversible. Thus, the solution for reducing the death rate of heart disease healthcare is becoming the passive medical care type. Physicians usually monitor the physical status of patients, which helps in deciding when to provide medical services by considering the real-time analysis of patients. Moreover, a significant division of pervasive clinical care is taken as the development of practical monitoring systems. An IoT approaches are overwhelming the progression in addressing the issue of heart disease patient care since they can modify the service mode in a pervasive way. A remote monitoring model is more significant for realising pervasive healthcare services. Here, an 'optimised ensemble learning'-based IoT-enabled heart disease monitoring system through an optimised ensemble fuzzy ranking (OEFR) strategy, deep feature extraction and heuristic improvement. Moreover, the hyperparameter of each classifier is optimised through a new improved dingo optimiser (I-DOX) algorithm. Throughout the result analysis, the accuracy of the designed I-DOX-based OEFR model is attained 96.72%. Thus, the analysis exhibits an overall performance analysis in terms of high performance.

AB  - BACKGROUND Smartwatches can be used for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection, but little is known about how older adults at risk for AF perceive their usability.
   METHODS We employed a mixed-methods study design using data from the ongoing Pulsewatch study, a randomized clinical trial (NCT03761394) examining the accuracy of a smartwatch-smartphone app dyad (Samsung/Android) compared to usual care with a patch monitor (Cardea SOLO (TM) ECG System) for detection of AF among older stroke survivors. To be eligible to participate in Pulsewatch, participants needed to be at least 50 years of age, have had an ischemic stroke, and have no major contraindications to anticoagulation therapy should AF be detected. After 14 days of use, usability was measured by the System Usability Scale (SUS) and investigator-generated questions. Qualitative interviews were conducted, transcribed, and coded via thematic analysis.
   RESULTS Ninety participants in the Pulsewatch trial were randomized to use a smartwatch-smartphone app dyad for 14 days (average age: 65 years, 41% female, 87% White), and 46% found it to be highly usable (SUS >= 68). In quantitative surveys, participants who used an assistive device (eg, wheelchair) and those with history of anxiety or depression were more likely to report anxiety associated with watch use. In qualitative interviews, study participants reported wanting a streamlined system that was more focused on rhythm monitoring and a smartwatch with a longer battery life. In-person training and support greatly improved their experience, and participants overwhelmingly preferred use of a smartwatch over traditional cardiac monitoring owing to its comfort, appearance, and convenience.
   CONCLUSION Older adults at high risk for AF who were randomized to use a smartwatch-app dyad for AF monitoring over 14 days found it to be usable for AF detection and preferred their use to the use of a patch monitor. However, participants reported that a simpler device interface and longer smartwatch battery life would increase the system's usability.

AB  - Changes in respiratory rate have been found to be one of the early signs of health deterioration in patients. In remote environments where diagnostic tools and medical attention are scarce, such as deep space exploration, the monitoring of the respiratory signal becomes crucial to timely detect life-threatening conditions. Nowadays, this signal can be measured using wearable technology; however, the use of such technology is often hampered by the low quality of the recordings, which leads more often to wrong diagnosis and conclusions. Therefore, to apply these data in diagnosis analysis, it is important to determine which parts of the signal are of sufficient quality. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the performance of a signal quality assessment framework, where two machine learning algorithms (support vector machine-SVM, and convolutional neural network-CNN) were used. The models were pre-trained using data of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The generalization capability of the models was evaluated by testing them on data from a different patient population, presenting normal and pathological breathing. The new patients underwent bariatric surgery and performed a controlled breathing protocol, displaying six different breathing patterns. Data augmentation (DA) and transfer learning (TL) were used to increase the size of the training set and to optimize the models for the new dataset. The effect of the different breathing patterns on the performance of the classifiers was also studied. The SVM did not improve when using DA, however, when using TL, the performance improved significantly (p < 0.05) compared to DA. The opposite effect was observed for CNN, where the biggest improvement was obtained using DA, while TL did not show a significant change. The models presented a low performance for shallow, slow and fast breathing patterns. These results suggest that it is possible to classify respiratory signals obtained with wearable technologies using pre-trained machine learning models. This will allow focusing on the relevant data and avoid misleading conclusions because of the noise, when designing bio-monitoring systems.

TI  - On the Possibility of Predicting Glycaemia 'On the Fly' with Constrained IoT Devices in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients

AB  - Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM1) patients are used to checking their blood glucose levels several times per day through finger sticks and, by subjectively handling this information, to try to predict their future glycaemia in order to choose a proper strategy to keep their glucose levels under control, in terms of insulin dosages and other factors. However, recent Internet of Things (IoT) devices and novel biosensors have allowed the continuous collection of the value of the glucose level by means of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) so that, with the proper Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, glucose evolution can be modeled, thus permitting a forecast of this variable. On the other hand, glycaemia dynamics require that such a model be user-centric and should be recalculated continuously in order to reflect the exact status of the patient, i.e., an 'on-the-fly' approach. In order to avoid, for example, the risk of being disconnected from the Internet, it would be ideal if this task could be performed locally in constrained devices like smartphones, but this would only be feasible if the execution times were fast enough. Therefore, in order to analyze if such a possibility is viable or not, an extensive, passive, CGM study has been carried out with 25 DM1 patients in order to build a solid dataset. Then, some well-known univariate algorithms have been executed in a desktop computer (as a reference) and two constrained devices: a smartphone and a Raspberry Pi, taking into account only past glycaemia data to forecast glucose levels. The results indicate that it is possible to forecast, in a smartphone, a 15-min horizon with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 11.65 mg/dL in just 16.15 s, employing a 10-min sampling of the past 6 h of data and the Random Forest algorithm. With the Raspberry Pi, the computational effort increases to 56.49 s assuming the previously mentioned parameters, but this can be improved to 34.89 s if Support Vector Machines are applied, achieving in this case an RMSE of 19.90 mg/dL. Thus, this paper concludes that local on-the-fly forecasting of glycaemia would be affordable with constrained devices.

AB  - Smoking is a major cause of cancer, heart disease and other afflictions that lead to early mortality. An effective smoking classification mechanism that provides insights into individual smoking habits would assist in implementing addiction treatment initiatives. Smoking activities often accompany other activities such as drinking or eating. Consequently, smoking activity recognition can be a challenging topic in human activity recognition (HAR). A deep learning framework for smoking activity recognition (SAR) employing smartwatch sensors was proposed together with a deep residual network combined with squeeze-and-excitation modules (ResNetSE) to increase the effectiveness of the SAR framework. The proposed model was tested against basic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU and BiGRU) to recognize smoking and other similar activities such as drinking, eating and walking using the UT-Smoke dataset. Three different scenarios were investigated for their recognition performances using standard HAR metrics (accuracy, Fl-score and the area under the ROC curve). Our proposed ResNetSE outperformed the other basic deep learning networks, with maximum accuracy of 98.63%.

AB  - Smart healthcare monitoring systems are proliferating due to the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled portable medical devices. The IoT and deep learning in the healthcare sector prevent diseases by evolving healthcare from face-to-face consultation to telemedicine. To protect athletes' life from life-threatening severe conditions and injuries in training and competitions, real-time monitoring of physiological indicators is critical. In this research work, we present a deep learning-based IoT-enabled real-time health monitoring system. The proposed system uses wearable medical devices to measure vital signs and apply various deep learning algorithms to extract valuable information. For this purpose, we have taken Sanda athletes as our case study. The deep learning algorithms help physicians properly analyze these athletes' conditions and offer the proper medications to them, even if the doctors are away. The performance of the proposed system is extensively evaluated using a cross-validation test by considering various statistical-based performance measurement metrics. The proposed system is considered an effective tool that diagnoses dreadful diseases among the athletes, such as brain tumors, heart disease, cancer, etc. The performance results of the proposed system are evaluated in terms of precision, recall, AUC, and F1, respectively.

AB  - Glucose monitoring technologies allow users to monitor glycemic fluctuations (e.g., blood glucose levels). This is particularly important for individuals who have diabetes mellitus (DM). Traditional self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) devices require the user to prick their finger and extract a blood drop to measure the blood glucose based on chemical reactions with the blood. Unlike traditional glucometer devices, noninvasive continuous glucose monitoring (NICGM) devices aim to solve these issues by consistently monitoring users' blood glucose levels (BGLs) without invasively acquiring a sample. In this work, we investigated the feasibility of a novel approach to NICGM using multiple off-the-shelf wearable sensors and learning-based models (i.e., machine learning) to predict blood glucose. Two datasets were used for this study: (1) the OhioT1DM dataset, provided by the Ohio University; and (2) the UofM dataset, created by our research team. The UofM dataset consists of fourteen features provided by six sensors for studying possible relationships between glucose and noninvasive biometric measurements. Both datasets are passed through a machine learning (ML) pipeline that tests linear and nonlinear models to predict BGLs from the set of noninvasive features. The results of this pilot study show that the combination of fourteen noninvasive biometric measurements with ML algorithms could lead to accurate BGL predictions within the clinical range; however, a larger dataset is required to make conclusions about the feasibility of this approach.

AB  - Several pathologies have a direct impact on society, causing public health problems. Pulmonary diseases such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are already the third leading cause of death in the world, leaving tuberculosis at ninth with 1.7 million deaths and over 10.4 million new occurrences. The detection of lung regions in images is a classic medical challenge. Studies show that computational methods contribute significantly to the medical diagnosis of lung pathologies by Computerized Tomography (CT), as well as through Internet of Things (IoT) methods based in the context on the health of things. The present work proposes a new model based on IoT for classification and segmentation of pulmonary CT images, applying the transfer learning technique in deep learning methods combined with Parzen's probability density. The proposed model uses an Application Programming Interface (API) based on the Internet of Medical Things to classify lung images. The approach was very effective, with results above 98% accuracy for classification in pulmonary images. Then the model proceeds to the lung segmentation stage using the Mask R-CNN network to create a pulmonary map and use fine-tuning to find the pulmonary borders on the CT image. The experiment was a success, the proposed method performed better than other works in the literature, reaching high segmentation metrics values such as accuracy of 98.34%. Besides reaching 5.43 s in segmentation time and overcoming other transfer learning models, our methodology stands out among the others because it is fully automatic. The proposed approach has simplified the segmentation process using transfer learning. It has introduced a faster and more effective method for better-performing lung segmentation, making our model fully automatic and robust.

AB  - Sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit transfers are fundamental daily motions that enable all other types of ambulation and gait. However, the ability to perform these motions can be severely impaired by different factors, such as the occurrence of a stroke, limiting the ability to engage in other daily activities. This study presents the recording and analysis of a comprehensive database of full body biomechanics and force data captured during sit-to-stand-to-sit movements in subjects who have and have not experienced stroke. These data were then used in conjunction with simple machine learning algorithms to predict vertical motion trajectories that could be further employed for the control of an assistive robot. A total of 30 people (including 6 with stroke) each performed 20 sit-to-stand-to-sit actions at two different seat heights, from which average trajectories were created. Weighted k-nearest neighbours and linear regression models were then used on two different sets of key participant parameters (height and weight, and BMI and age), to produce a predicted trajectory. Resulting trajectories matched the true ones for non-stroke subjects with an average R-2 score of 0.864 +/- 0.134 using k = 3 and 100% seat height when using height and weight parameters. Even among a small sample of stroke patients, balance and motion trends were noticed along with a large within-class variation, showing that larger scale trials need to be run to obtain significant results. The full dataset of sit-to-stand-to-sit actions for each user is made publicly available for further research.

AB  - BackgroundDiabetes is an independent risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), which is associated with increases in mortality and morbidity, as well as a diminished quality of life. Renal involvement in diabetes is common, and since chronic kidney disease (CKD) shares several of the same putative mechanisms as AF, it may contribute to its increased risk in individuals with diabetes. The objective of this study is to identify the relationship between CKD and the rates of newly-diagnosed AF in individuals with diabetes taking part in a screening program using a self-applied wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) patch.Materials and methodsThe study included 608 individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes among 1738 total actively monitored participants in the prospective mHealth Screening to Prevent Strokes (mSToPS) trial. Participants, without a prior diagnosis of AF, wore an ECG patch for 2 weeks, twice, over a 4-months period and followed clinically through claims data for 1 year. Definitions of CKD included ICD-9 or ICD-10 chronic renal failure diagnostic codes, and the Health Profile Database algorithm. Individuals requiring dialysis were excluded from trial enrollment.ResultsNinety-six (15.8%) of study participants with diabetes also had a diagnosis of CKD. Over 12 months of follow-up, 19 new cases of AF were detected among the 608 participants. AF was newly diagnosed in 7.3% of participants with CKD and 2.3% in those without (P<0.05) over 12 months of follow-up. In a univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the risk of incident AF was 3 times higher in individuals with CKD relative to those without CKD: hazard ratios (HR) 3.106 (95% CI 1.2-7.9). After adjusting for the effect of age, sex, and hypertension, the risk of incident AF was still significantly higher in those with CKD: HR 2.886 (95% CI 1.1-7.5).ConclusionAmong individuals with diabetes, CKD significantly increases the risk of incident AF. Identification of AF prior to clinical symptoms through active ECG screening could help to improve the clinical outcomes in individuals with CKD and diabetes.

AB  - World Health Organization (WHO) estimated cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is main contributor to the death count globally. In addition, there are shortcomings of specialists in developing countries to handle these diseases. Internet of things (IoT) and significant advances in machine learning techniques offers more efficient healthcare services. The research work proposed a IoT enabled, cloud-centric solution for remote monitoring of ECG, which could save lives of rural area people particularly in Golden hour. Firstly, pre-processing of ECG signal is per-formed using Savitzky-Golay (SG filter) for removal of the baseline wanders and maximum overlap discrete wavelet packet transform (MOWPT) is applied for the removal of high noise followed by delineation process of ECG characteristic points. Then deep learned convolution neural network (CNN) is trained and classification is done. For encryption and authentication, Triple data encryption standard is used for security whereas, water cycle optimization technique is used for authentication. IoT is implemented using the ThingSpeak platform, which enables the visualization and analysed the ECG data over the cloud server. Using ThingSpeak, encrypted and authenticated ECG data is shared with cardiologist for examination. To validate the proposed classification method, the standard annotated dataset of the MIT-BIH database is tested and various performance metrics were calculated. The proposed deep learned CNN classifier classifies the heartbeats into five types of arrhythmias with an average accuracy of 99.12%, whereas the sensitivity and specificity of this proposed model are 100% and 99.9% respectively. The achieved results demonstrated better performance as compared to methods reported in the literature.

AB  - Hypertension is the main cause of blood pressure (BP), which further causes various cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The recent COVID-19 pandemic raised the burden on the healthcare system and also limits the resources to these patients only. The treatment of chronic patients, especially those who suffer from CVD, has fallen behind, resulting in increased deaths from CVD around the world. Regular monitoring of BP is crucial to prevent CVDs as it can be controlled and diagnosed through constant monitoring. To find an effective and convenient procedure for the early diagnosis of CVDs, photoplethysmography (PPG) is recognized as a low-cost technology. Through PPG technology, various cardiovascular parameters, including blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, etc., are detected. Merging the healthcare domain with information technology (IT) is a demanding area to reduce the rehospitalization of CVD patients. In the proposed model, PPG signals from the Internet of things (IoT)-enabled wearable patient monitoring (WPM) devices are used to monitor the heart rate (HR), etc., of the patients remotely. This article investigates various machine learning techniques such as decision tree (DT), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) and the deep learning model one-dimensional convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (1D CNN-LSTM) to develop a system that assists physicians during continuous monitoring, which achieved an accuracy of 99.5% using PPG-BP data set. The proposed system provides cost-effective, efficient, and fully connected monitoring systems for cardiac patients.

AB  - In the modern world, technology plays a major role in making processes easy, efficient, and mostly automated no matter where they take place. Technology such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain, and deep learning has revolutionized the growth of many fields. One of the best examples is the medical field, in which timely and accurate diagnoses must be made routinely; traditional systems are of little help due to their lack of accuracy and the time delays they introduce. Instead, advancements in deep learning (DL) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are useful in building effective models for timely and accurate diagnosis and developing a smart health care system. In this paper, we propose a disease diagnosis model using DL in combination with IoT. The stages involved in the model are as follows: (a) Data are collected from various IoT wearable devices, in which sensors play a vital role in collecting data and relaying these data to DL systems for accurate diagnosis. (b) These medical data are preprocessed, as they contain noise. (c) The preprocessed data are passed to an isolation forest (iForest) for outlier detection with linear time complexity and high precision. (d) The data undergo a classification process, in which we use an integration of the particle swarm optimization algorithm and DenseNet169 (PSO-DenseNet169) to diagnose diseases; the parameters are tuned to improve accuracy. When we compared our proposed model to existing models such as SVM, KNN, NB-A, and J-48 based on performance parameters such as sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity, we found that our model outperformed the state of the art by 96.16% and 97.26% in diagnosing the heart and thyroid, respectively.

AB  - Measuring activities of daily living (ADLs) using wearable technologies may offer higher precision and granularity than the current clinical assessments for patients after stroke. This study aimed to develop and determine the accuracy of detecting different ADLs using machine-learning (ML) algorithms and wearable sensors. Eleven post-stroke patients participated in this pilot study at an ADL Simulation Lab across two study visits. We collected blocks of repeated activity ("atomic" activity) performance data to train our ML algorithms during one visit. We evaluated our ML algorithms using independent semi-naturalistic activity data collected at a separate session. We tested Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for model development. XGBoost was the best classification model. We achieved 82% accuracy based on ten ADL tasks. With a model including seven tasks, accuracy improved to 90%. ADL tasks included chopping food, vacuuming, sweeping, spreading jam or butter, folding laundry, eating, brushing teeth, taking off/putting on a shirt, wiping a cupboard, and buttoning a shirt. Results provide preliminary evidence that ADL functioning can be predicted with adequate accuracy using wearable sensors and ML. The use of external validation (independent training and testing data sets) and semi-naturalistic testing data is a major strength of the study and a step closer to the long-term goal of ADL monitoring in real-world settings. Further investigation is needed to improve the ADL prediction accuracy, increase the number of tasks monitored, and test the model outside of a laboratory setting.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) system is composed of several numbers of sensor nodes and systems, which are wirelessly interlinked to the internet. Generally, big data is the storage of a huge amount of information, which causes the classification process to be very challenging. Numerous big data classification approaches are implemented, but the computational time and secure handling of information are the major problems. The aim of the study is the development of big data approach in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare application. Hence, this paper presents the proposed Dragonfly Rider Competitive Swarm Optimization-based Deep Residual Network (DRCSO-based DRN) for big data classification in IoT. First, the IoT nodes are simulated, and the heart disease patient data are collected through sensors. The routing is done using the Multi-objective Fractional Gravitational Search Algorithm (Multi-objective FGSA). In the Base Station (BS), the big data classification is done. Here, the classification is done using MapReduce (MR) framework, which includes two phases, like mapper and the reducer phase. The input data is initially fed to the mapper phase in the map-reduce (MR) framework. In the mapper phase, feature selection is carried out based on Dragonfly Rider Optimization Algorithm (DROA) in order to select the appropriate features for further processing. The DROA is modeled through merging Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) and Rider Optimization Algorithm (ROA). In the reducer phase, the classification is performed using DRN, which is trained by the developed DRCSO algorithm. The DRCSO is modeled by incorporating DA, ROA and Competitive Swarm Optimization (CSO). In addition, the performance of the developed method is outperformed than the existing approaches such as Linguistic Fuzzy Rules with Canopy Mapreduce (LFR-CM) + Fuzzy classifier, Machine learning-dependent k-nearest neighbors (FML-KNN), MapReduce-Fuzzy Integral-dependent Ensemble Learning Model+Single hidden layer feedforward neural network (MR-FI-ELM + SLFN) and DROA-recurrent neural network (RNN) based on the accuracy, average residual energy and throughput with the value of 0.929, 0.086J and 86.585. The proposed method is used to manage and derive meaningful information from the patient's medical records, medical examinations results and hospital records.

AB  - As the age profile of many societies continues to increase, in addition to the increasing population of people affected by chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and so on, supporting health, both mentally and physically, is of increasing importance if independent living is to be maintained. Sensing, remote health monitoring, and, ultimately, recognising activities of daily living have been an promising solution. From a technical perspective, the Internet of Things (IoT) is gaining a rapidly growing attention in many disciplines, especially in personalised healthcare. Meanwhile, body area sensor network (BASN) under the IoT framework has been widely applied for ubiquitous health monitoring, for example. ECG monitoring has been commonly adopted as vital approach for diagnosing heart disease. The main contribution of this paper include the following: firstly, this paper presents a novel system, the WISE (Wearable IoT-cloud-baSed hEalth monitoring system), for real-time personal health monitoring. WISE adopts the BASN (body area sensor network) framework in the support of real-time health monitoring. Several wearable sensors have been embedded, including the heartbeat, body temperature, and the blood pressure sensors. Secondly, the majority of existing wearable health monitoring systems requisite a smart phone as data processing, visualisation, and transmission gateway, which will indeed impact the normal daily use of the smart phone. Whilst in WISE, data gathered from the BASN are directly transmitted to the cloud, and a lightweight wearable LCD can be embedded as an alternative solution for quick view of the real-time data.

AB  - Background: Some attempts have been made to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) with a wearable device equipped with photoelectric volumetric pulse wave technology, and it is expected to be applied under real clinical conditions.
   Objective: This study is the second part of a 2-phase study aimed at developing a method for immediate detection of paroxysmal AF, using a wearable device with built-in photoplethysmography (PPG). The objective of this study is to develop an algorithm to immediately diagnose AF by an Apple Watch equipped with a PPG sensor that is worn by patients undergoing cardiac surgery and to use machine learning on the pulse data output from the device.
   Methods: A total of 80 patients who underwent cardiac surgery at a single institution between June 2020 and March 2021 were monitored for postoperative AF, using a telemetry-monitored electrocardiogram (ECG) and an Apple Watch. AF was diagnosed by qualified physicians from telemetry-monitored ECGs and 12-lead ECGs; a diagnostic algorithm was developed using machine learning on the pulse rate data output from the Apple Watch.
   Results: One of the 80 patients was excluded from the analysis due to redness caused by wearing the Apple Watch. Of 79 patients, 27 (34.2%) developed AF, and 199 events of AF including brief AF were observed. Of them, 18 events of AF lasting longer than 1 hour were observed, and cross-correlation analysis showed that pulse rate measured by Apple Watch was strongly correlated (cross-correlation functions [CCF]: 0.6-0.8) with 8 events and very strongly correlated (CCF>0.8) with 3 events. The diagnostic accuracy by machine learning was 0.9416 (sensitivity 0.909 and specificity 0.838 at the point closest to the top left) for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
   Conclusions: We were able to safely monitor pulse rate in patients who wore an Apple Watch after cardiac surgery. Although the pulse rate measured by the PPG sensor does not follow the heart rate recorded by telemetry-monitored ECGs in some parts, which may reduce the accuracy of AF diagnosis by machine learning, we have shown the possibility of clinical application of using only the pulse rate collected by the PPG sensor for the early detection of AF.

AB  - Introduction
   Falls cause major expenses in the healthcare sector. We investigate the ability of supporting a fall risk assessment by introducing algorithms for automated assessments of standardized fall risk-related tests via wearable devices.
   Methods
   In a study, 13 participants conducted the standardized 6-Minutes Walk Test, the Timed-Up-and-Go Test, the 30-Second Sit-to-Stand Test, and the 4-Stage Balance Test repeatedly, producing 226 tests in total. Automated
   algorithms computed by wearable devices, as well as a visual analysis of the recorded data streams, were compared to the observational results conducted by physiotherapists.
   Results
   There was a high congruence between automated assessments and the ground truth for all four test types (ranging from 78.15% to 96.55%), with deviations ranging all well within one standard deviation of the ground truth. Fall risk (assessed by questionnaire) correlated with the individual tests.
   Conclusions
   The automated fall risk assessment using wearable devices and algorithms matches the validity of the ground truth, thus providing a resourceful alternative to the effortful observational assessment, while minimizing the risk of human error. No single test can predict overall fall risk; instead, a much more complex model with additional input parameters (e.g., fall history, medication etc.) is needed.

AB  - Respiratory behaviors provide useful measures of lung health. The current methods have limited capabilities of continuous characterization of respiratory behaviors, often required to assess respiratory disorders and diseases. This work presents a system equipped with a machine learning algorithm, capable of continuously monitoring respiratory behaviors. The system, consisting of two wireless wearable sensors, accurately extracts and classifies the features of respiratory behaviors of subjects within various postures, wirelessly transmitting the temporal respiratory behaviors to a laptop. The sensors were attached on the midway of the xiphoid process and the costal margin, and 1 cm above the umbilicus, respectively. The wireless wearable sensor, consisting of ultrasound emitter, ultrasound receiver, data acquisition and wireless transmitter, has a small footprint and light weight. The sensors correlate the mechanical strain at wearing sites to lung volume by measuring the local circumference changes of the chest and abdominal walls simultaneously. Eleven subjects were recruited to evaluate the wireless wearable sensors. Three different random forest classifiers, including generic, individual, and weighted-adaptive classifiers, were used to process the wireless data of the subjects at four different postures. The results demonstrate the respiratory behaviors are individual- and posture-dependent. The generic classifier merely reaches the accuracy of classifying postures of 21.9 +/- 1.7% while individual and weighted-adaptive classifiers mark substantially high, up to 98.9 +/- 0.6% and 98.8 +/- 0.6%, respectively. The accurate monitoring of respiratory behaviors can track the progression of respiratory disorders and diseases, including chronic respiratory obstructive disease (COPD), asthma, apnea, and others for timely and objective approaches for control.

AB  - Background: Chronic lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterized by exacerbations. They are unpleasant for patients and sometimes severe enough to cause hospital admission and death. Moreover, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, vulnerable populations with these disorders are at high risk, and their routine care cannot be done properly. Remote monitoring offers a low cost and safe solution for gaining visibility into the health of people in their daily lives, making it useful for vulnerable populations.
   Objective: The primary objective is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring using wearables and mobile phones in patients with pulmonary diseases. The secondary objective is to provide power calculations for future studies centered around understanding the number of exacerbations according to sample size and duration.
   Methods: Twenty participants will be recruited in each of three cohorts (COPD, IPF, and posthospitalization COVID). Data collection will be done remotely using the RADAR-Base (Remote Assessment of Disease And Relapse) mobile health (mHealth) platform for different devices, including Garmin wearable devices and smart spirometers, mobile app questionnaires, surveys, and finger pulse oximeters. Passive data include wearable-derived continuous heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiration rate, activity, and sleep. Active data include disease-specific patient-reported outcome measures, mental health questionnaires, and symptom tracking to track disease trajectory. Analyses will assess the feasibility of lung disorder remote monitoring (including data quality, data completeness, system usability, and system acceptability). We will attempt to explore disease trajectory, patient stratification, and identification of acute clinical events such as exacerbations. A key aspect is understanding the potential of real-time data collection. We will simulate an intervention to acquire responses at the time of the event to assess model performance for exacerbation identification.
   Results: The Remote Assessment of Lung Disease and Impact on Physical and Mental Health (RALPMH) study provides a unique opportunity to assess the use of remote monitoring in the evaluation of lung disorders. The study started in the middle of June 2021. The data collection apparatus, questionnaires, and wearable integrations were setup and tested by the clinical teams prior to the start of recruitment. While recruitment is ongoing, real-time exacerbation identification models are currently being constructed. The models will be pretrained daily on data of previous days, but the inference will be run in real time.
   Conclusions: The RALPMH study will provide a reference infrastructure for remote monitoring of lung diseases. It specifically involves information regarding the feasibility and acceptability of remote monitoring and the potential of real-time data collection and analysis in the context of chronic lung disorders. It will help plan and inform decisions in future studies in the area of respiratory health.

AB  - An electrocardiogram (ECG) is extensively used to evaluate the heart condition that can lead to further investigate heart ailments detection of heart diseases. The process is simple, quick, and non-invasive. However, manually detecting and classifying arrhythmia is not easy, as manually analyzing the ECG signals is timeconsuming. This research proposes an automatic detection and classification of arrhythmia using the proposed optimized deep learning classifier. Initially, the ECG signals collected using the Internet of Things (IoT) nodes are processed to generate the QRS complex and the RR interval for establishing the feature vector for the arrhythmia classification, which is done using the proposed Coy-Grey Wolf optimization-based deep convolution neural network (Coy-GWO-based Deep CNN) classifier that detects the anomalies in the ECG signal. The proposed CoyGWO algorithm inherits the hybrid characteristics, such as social hunting hierarchies and the hunting experiences of the canids, which ensures the effective parameter update in the classifier. Finally, the classification model is implemented and analyzed based on the performance measures. The proposed Coy-GWO-based Deep CNN attained the classification accuracy of 95%, which outperforms the existing techniques.

AB  - Physiological time series are affected by many factors, making them highly nonlinear and nonstationary. As a consequence, heart rate time series are often considered difficult to predict and handle. However, heart rate behavior can indicate underlying cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as mood disorders. Given the importance of accurate modeling and reliable predictions of heart rate fluctuations for the prevention and control of certain diseases, it is paramount to identify models with the best performance in such tasks. The objectives of this study were to compare the results of three different forecasting models (Autoregressive Model, Long Short-Term Memory Network, and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network) trained and tested on heart rate beats per minute data obtained from twelve heterogeneous participants and to identify the architecture with the best performance in terms of modeling and forecasting heart rate behavior. Heart rate beats per minute data were collected using a wearable device over a period of 10 days from twelve different participants who were heterogeneous in age, sex, medical history, and lifestyle behaviors. The goodness of the results produced by the models was measured using both the mean absolute error and the root mean square error as error metrics. Despite the three models showing similar performance, the Autoregressive Model gave the best results in all settings examined. For example, considering one of the participants, the Autoregressive Model gave a mean absolute error of 2.069 (compared to 2.173 of the Long Short-Term Memory Network and 2.138 of the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network), achieving an improvement of 5.027% and 3.335%, respectively. Similar results can be observed for the other participants. The findings of the study suggest that regardless of an individual's age, sex, and lifestyle behaviors, their heart rate largely depends on the pattern observed in the previous few minutes, suggesting that heart rate can be reasonably regarded as an autoregressive process. The findings also suggest that minute-by-minute heart rate prediction can be accurately performed using a linear model, at least in individuals without pathologies that cause heartbeat irregularities. The findings also suggest many possible applications for the Autoregressive Model, in principle in any context where minute-by-minute heart rate prediction is required (arrhythmia detection and analysis of the response to training, among others).

AB  - Ca2+ sparks are the elementary Ca2+ release events in cardiomyocytes, altered properties of which lead to impaired Ca2+ handling and finally contribute to cardiac pathology under various diseases. Despite increasing use of machine-learning algorithms in deciphering the content of biological and medical data, Ca2+ spark images and data are yet to be deeply learnt and analyzed. In the present study, we developed a deep residual convolutional neural network method to detect Ca2+ sparks. Compared to traditional detection methods with arbitrarily defined thresholds to distinguish signals from noises, our new method detected more Ca2+ sparks with lower amplitudes but similar spatiotemporal distributions, thereby indicating that our new algorithm detected many very weak events that are usually omitted when using traditional detection methods. Furthermore, we proposed an event-based logistic regression and binary classification model to classify single cardiomyocytes using Ca2+ spark characteristics, which to date have generally been used only for simple statistical analyses and comparison between normal and diseased groups. Using this new detection algorithm and classification model, we succeeded in distinguishing wild type (WT) vs RyR2-R2474S(+/-) cardiomyocytes with 100% accuracy, and vehicle vs isoprenaline-insulted WT cardiomyocytes with 95.6% accuracy. The model can be extended to judge whether a small number of cardiomyocytes (and so the whole heart) are under a specific cardiac disease. Thus, this study provides a novel and powerful approach for the research and application of calcium signaling in cardiac diseases.

AB  - (1) Background: Consumer smartwatches may be a helpful tool to screen for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, validation studies on older stroke patients remain scarce. The aim of this pilot study from RCT NCT05565781 was to validate the resting heart rate (HR) measurement and the irregular rhythm notification (IRN) feature in stroke patients in sinus rhythm (SR) and AF. (2) Methods: Resting clinical HR measurements (every 5 min) were assessed using continuous bedside ECG monitoring (CEM) and the Fitbit Charge 5 (FC5). IRNs were gathered after at least 4 h of CEM. Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), Bland-Altman analysis, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used for agreement and accuracy assessment. (3) Results: In all, 526 individual pairs of measurements were obtained from 70 stroke patients-age 79.4 years (SD +/- 10.2), 63% females, BMI 26.3 (IQ 22.2-30.5), and NIHSS score 8 (IQR 1.5-20). The agreement between the FC5 and CEM was good (CCC 0.791) when evaluating paired HR measurements in SR. Meanwhile, the FC5 provided weak agreement (CCC 0.211) and low accuracy (MAPE 16.48%) when compared to CEM recordings in AF. Regarding the accuracy of the IRN feature, analysis found a low sensitivity (34%) and high specificity (100%) for detecting AF. (4) Conclusion: The FC5 was accurate at assessing the HR during SR, but the accuracy during AF was poor. In contrast, the IRN feature was acceptable for guiding decisions regarding AF screening in stroke patients.

AB  - The number of elderly people is increasing, and heart diseases are a major issue in a healthy aging of population. Indeed, the possibility of hospital care is limited and the avoidance of crowded hospitals recently became even more essential. Meanwhile, the possibility to exploit e-health technology for home care would be desirable. In this framework, the concept design of a soft sensor for measuring cardiovascular risk of a patient in real time is here reported. ECG, blood oxygenation, body temperature, and data acquired from patients' interviews are processed to extract characterizing features. These are then classified to assess the cardiovascular risk. Experimental results show that patients' classification accuracy can be as high as 80% when employing a random forest classifier, even with few data employed for training. Finally, method evaluation was extended by exploiting further data and by means of a noise robustness test.

AB  - Rationale: Exercise intolerance limits the ability of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to perform daily living activities. Noninvasive ventilation reduces dyspnea and improves exercise performance, but current systems are unsuitable for ambulatory use.
   Objectives: In patients with COPD experiencing exercise-induced desaturation, we evaluated improvements in exercise tolerance facilitated by a wearable, 1-lb, noninvasive open ventilation (NIOV) system featuring a nasal pillow interface during constant work rate (CWR) cycle ergometer exercise and associated effects on dyspnea, respiratory muscle activation, and pulmonary gas exchange efficiency.
   Methods: Fifteen men with COPD (FEV1 = 32.2 +/- 12.0% predicted; FEV1/FVC 31.6 +/- 7.1%; exercise oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry [Sp(O2)] = 86.5 +/- 2.9%) participated. After incremental testing establishing peak work rate, subjects completed three visits in which they performed CWR exercise to tolerance at 80% peak workrate: (1) unencumbered breathing room air, (2) using NIOV + compressed air, (3) using NIOV + compressed O-2, or (4) using O-2 via nasal cannula. Assessments included exercise duration, surface inspiratory muscle EMG, Sp(O2), transcutaneous P-CO2, and Borg dyspnea scores.
   Measurements and Main Results: Exercise endurance was 17.6 +/- 5.7 minutes using NIOV + O-2, greatly prolonged compared with unencumbered (5.6 +/- 1.9 min), nasal O-2 (11.4 +/- 6.8 min), and NIOV + Air (6.3 +/- 4.1 min). Isotime Sp(O2) was higher and intercostal, scalene, and diaphragmatic EMG activity was reduced using NIOV + O-2 compared with unencumbered, nasal O-2, and NIOV + Air, signifying respiratory muscle unloading. Isotime dyspnea reduction correlated with isotime EMG reduction (r = 0.42, P = 0.0053). There were no significant differences in isotime V-D/V-T or transcutaneous P-CO2 among treatments.
   Conclusions: NIOV + O-2 yielded substantial exercise endurance improvements accompanied by respiratory muscle unloading and dyspnea reductions in patients with severe hypoxemic COPD.

AB  - Air pollution is a major issue resulting from the excessive use of conventional energy sources in developing countries and worldwide. Particulate Matter less than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) is the most dangerous air pollutant invading the human respiratory system and causing lung and heart diseases. Therefore, innovative air pollution forecasting methods and systems are required to reduce such risk. To that end, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled system for monitoring and predicting PM2.5 concentration on both edge devices and the cloud. This system employs a hybrid prediction architecture using several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms hosted by Nonlinear AutoRegression with eXogenous input (NARX). It uses the past 24 h of PM2.5, cumulated wind speed and cumulated rain hours to predict the next hour of PM2.5. This system was tested on a PC to evaluate cloud prediction and a Raspberry P-i to evaluate edge devices' prediction. Such a system is essential, responding quickly to air pollution in remote areas with low bandwidth or no internet connection. The performance of our system was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination (R-2), Index of Agreement (IA), and duration in seconds. The obtained results highlighted that NARX/LSTM achieved the highest R-2 and IA and the least RMSE and NRMSE, outperforming other previously proposed deep learning hybrid algorithms. In contrast, NARX/XGBRF achieved the best balance between accuracy and speed on the Raspberry P-i.

AB  - Smart healthcare has become a hot research topic due to the contemporary developments of Internet of Things (IoT), sensor technologies, cloud computing, and others. Besides, the latest advances of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools find helpful for decision-making in innovative healthcare to diagnose several diseases. Ovarian Cancer (OC) is a kind of cancer that affects women's ovaries, and it is tedious to identify OC at the primary stages with a high mortality rate. The OC data produced by the Internet ofMedical Things (IoMT) devices can be utilized to differentiate OC. In this aspect, this paper introduces a newquantum blackwidowoptimizationwith a machine learningenabled decision support system (QBWO-MLDSS) for smart healthcare. The primary intention of theQBWO-MLDSS technique is to detect and categorize the OC rapidly and accurately. Besides, the QBWO-MLDSS model involves a Z-score normalization approach to pre-process the data. In addition, the QBWO-MLDSS technique derives a QBWO algorithm as a feature selection to derive optimum feature subsets. Moreover, symbiotic organisms search (SOS) with extreme learning machine (ELM) model is applied as a classifier for the detection and classification of ELM model, thereby improving the overall classification performance. The design of QBWO and SOS for OC detection and classification in the smart healthcare environment shows the study's novelty. The experimental result analysis of the QBWO-MLDSS model is conducted using a benchmark dataset, and the comparative results reported the enhanced outcomes of theQBWO-MLDSS model over the recent approaches.

AB  - Cloud computing provides resources over the Internet and allows a plethora of applications to be deployed to provide services for different industries. The major bottleneck being faced currently in these cloud frameworks is their limited scalability and hence inability to cater to the requirements of centralized Internet of Things (IoT) based compute environments. The main reason for this is that latency-sensitive applications like health monitoring and surveillance systems now require computation over large amounts of data (Big Data) transferred to centralized database and from database to cloud data centers which leads to drop in performance of such systems. The new paradigms of fog and edge computing provide innovative solutions by bringing resources closer to the user and provide low latency and energy efficient solutions for data processing compared to cloud domains. Still, the current fog models have many limitations and focus from a limited perspective on either accuracy of results or reduced response time but not both. We proposed a novel framework called HealthFog for integrating ensemble deep learning in Edge computing devices and deployed it for a real-life application of automatic Heart Disease analysis. HealthFog delivers healthcare as a fog service using IoT devices and efficiently manages the data of heart patients, which comes as user requests. Fog-enabled cloud framework, FogBus is used to deploy and test the performance of the proposed model in terms of power consumption, network bandwidth, latency, jitter, accuracy and execution time. HealthFog is configurable to various operation modes which provide the best Quality of Service or prediction accuracy, as required, in diverse fog computation scenarios and for different user requirements.

AB  - Machine learning techniques combined with wearable electronics can deliver accurate short-term blood glucose level prediction models. These models can learn personalized glucose-insulin dynamics based on the sensor data collected by monitoring several aspects of the physiological condition and daily activity of an individual. Until now, the prevalent approach for developing data-driven prediction models was to collect as much data as possible to help physicians and patients optimally adjust therapy. The objective of this work was to investigate the minimum data variety, volume, and velocity required to create accurate person-centric short-term prediction models. We developed a series of these models using different machine learning time series forecasting techniques suitable for execution within a wearable processor. We conducted an extensive passive patient monitoring study in real-world conditions to build an appropriate data set. The study involved a subset of type 1 diabetic subjects wearing a flash glucose monitoring system. We comparatively and quantitatively evaluated the performance of the developed data-driven prediction models and the corresponding machine learning techniques. Our results indicate that very accurate short-term prediction can be achieved by only monitoring interstitial glucose data over a very short time period and using a low sampling frequency. The models developed can predict glucose levels within a 15-min horizon with an average error as low as 15.43 mg/dL using only 24 historic values collected within a period of sex hours, and by increasing the sampling frequency to include 72 values, the average error is reduced to 10.15 mg/dL. Our prediction models are suitable for execution within a wearable device, requiring the minimum hardware requirements while at simultaneously achieving very high prediction accuracy.

AB  - As the world population continues to age, chronic diseases are on the rise. One of these diseases is stroke, which is a dangerous disease that can lead to many social and economic difficulties. Strokes can cause persistent neurological sequelae and physical disabilities; in some cases, motor function of the upper or lower body may be impaired, resulting in abnormal walking patterns or a loss of walking ability. These differences can be captured through walking patterns and gait information. There is therefore a need for research examining systems that can quickly detect signs of stroke based on human biosignals collected during daily life, such as motor function and the walking speed of the upper and lower limbs. By accurately predicting the early symptoms of stroke diseases, neural damage can be reduced with timely visits to medical institutions for treatment. In this paper, we designed and implemented a new AI-based system using real-time motion data for predicting stroke in the elderly. Initial data were collected from elderly Koreans while walking with attached wearable sensors. The sensors were placed on both shoulders and quadriceps. The data were processed, and we obtained a total of 12 motion attributes (angles and acceleration information). Predictive models using machine learning and deep learning algorithms were then constructed. The performance of the proposed system was verified with high prediction accuracies of 98.25% for the C4.5 decision tree model, 98.72% for RandomForest, 96.60% for XGBoost, and 98.99% for long short-term memory (LSTM). Hence, this paper provides a method for quickly and accurately predicting the early onset of stroke based on motion attribute values obtained while walking.

AB  - The importance of an embedded wearable device with automatic detection and alarming cannot be overstated, given that 15-30% of patients with atrial fibrillation are reported to be asymptomatic. These asymptomatic patients do not seek medical care, hence traditional diagnostic tools including Holter are not effective for the further prevention of associated stroke or heart failure. This is likely to be more so in the era of COVID-19, in which patients become more reluctant on hospitalization and checkups. However, little literature is available on this important topic. For this reason, this study developed efficient deep learning with model compression, which is designed to use ECG data and classify arrhythmia in an embedded wearable device. ECG-signal data came from Korea University Anam Hospital in Seoul, Korea, with 28,308 unique patients (15,412 normal and 12,896 arrhythmia). Resnets and Mobilenets with model compression (TensorFlow Lite) were applied and compared for the diagnosis of arrhythmia in an embedded wearable device. The weight size of the compressed model registered a remarkable decrease from 743 MB to 76 KB (1/10000), whereas its performance was almost the same as its original counterpart. Resnet and Mobilenet were similar in terms of accuracy, i.e., Resnet-50 Hz (97.3) vs. Mo-bilenet-50 Hz (97.2), Resnet-100 Hz (98.2) vs. Mobilenet-100 Hz (97.9). Here, 50 Hz/100 Hz denotes the down-sampling rate. However, Resnets took more flash memory and longer inference time than did Mobilenets. In conclusion, Mobilenet would be a more efficient model than Resnet to classify arrhythmia in an embedded wearable device.

AB  - The advancement of investigation tools and electronic health records (EHR) enables a paradigm shift from guideline-specific therapy toward patient-specific precision medicine. The multiparametric and large detailed information necessitates novel analyses to explore the insight of diseases and to aid the diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning (DL) provide various models of supervised, or unsupervised algorithms, and sophisticated neural networks to generate predictive models more precisely than conventional ones. The data, application tasks, and algorithms are three key components in AI. Various data formats are available in daily clinical practice of hepatology, including radiological imaging, EHR, liver pathology, data from wearable devices, and multi-omics measurements. The images of abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to predict liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and differentiation of benign tumors from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using EHR, the AI algorithms help predict the diagnosis and outcomes of liver cirrhosis, HCC, NAFLD, portal hypertension, varices, liver transplantation, and acute liver failure. AI helps to predict severity and patterns of fibrosis, steatosis, activity of NAFLD, and survival of HCC by using pathological data. Despite of these high potentials of AI application, data preparation, collection, quality, labeling, and sampling biases of data are major concerns. The selection, evaluation, and validation of algorithms, as well as real-world application of these AI models, are also challenging. Nevertheless, AI opens the new era of precision medicine in hepatology, which will change our future practice.

AB  - Heart disease is one of the leading causes for death in men and women across the globe. Several characteristics that can be monitored to predict the heart disease in the earlier stage are blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar level and body weight. The technology is revolutionizing the existing healthcare infrastructure. With the inclusion of Internet of Things (IoT), now we can monitor patients remotely, store their data, and process it for further analysis. However, the need is to propose new and advanced secured algorithms for fast processing and efficient detection of events. In this article, a machine learning based Sine Cosine Weighted K-Nearest Neighbour (SCA_WKNN) algorithm is proposed for the heart disease prediction that learns from the data being stored in blockchain. Since the data stored in the blockchain are tamper resistant, it acts as an authentic source for learning data and also as a secure storage environment for patient information. The performance of proposed SCA_WKNN is assessed in comparison with other algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and root mean square error. Our analysis indicates that SCA_WKNN achieves 4.59% and 15.61% maximum accuracy than W K-NN and K NN, respectively. Also, blockchain-based storage is compared with peer-to-peer storage in terms of latency and throughput. The blockchain-based decentralized storage achieves 25.03% maximum throughput than peer-to-peer storage.

AB  - With an aging population and increased chronic diseases, remote health monitoring has become critical to improving patient care and reducing healthcare costs. The Internet of Things (IoT) has recently drawn much interest as a potential remote health monitoring remedy. IoT-based systems can gather and analyze a wide range of physiological data, including blood oxygen levels, heart rates, body temperatures, and ECG signals, and then provide real-time feedback to medical professionals so they may take appropriate action. This paper proposes an IoT-based system for remote monitoring and early detection of health problems in home clinical settings. The system comprises three sensor types: MAX30100 for measuring blood oxygen level and heart rate; AD8232 ECG sensor module for ECG signal data; and MLX90614 non-contact infrared sensor for body temperature. The collected data is transmitted to a server using the MQTT protocol. A pre-trained deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network with an attention layer is used on the server to classify potential diseases. The system can detect five different categories of heartbeats: Normal Beat, Supraventricular premature beat, Premature ventricular contraction, Fusion of ventricular, and Unclassifiable beat from ECG sensor data and fever or non-fever from body temperature. Furthermore, the system provides a report on the patient's heart rate and oxygen level, indicating whether they are within normal ranges or not. The system automatically connects the user to the nearest doctor for further diagnosis if any critical abnormalities are detected.

AB  - Background: Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the world today. Ecological research on smoking in context currently relies on self-reported smoking behavior. Emerging smartwatch technology may more objectively measure smoking behavior by automatically detecting smoking sessions using robust machine learning models.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the feasibility of detecting smoking behavior using smartwatches. The second aim of this study was to compare the success of observing smoking behavior with smartwatches to that of conventional self-reporting.
   Methods: A convenience sample of smokers was recruited for this study. Participants (N=10) recorded 12 hours of accelerometer data using a mobile phone and smartwatch. During these 12 hours, they engaged in various daily activities, including smoking, for which they logged the beginning and end of each smoking session. Raw data were classified as either smoking or nonsmoking using a machine learning model for pattern recognition. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing the output with a detailed description of a modeled smoking session.
   Results: In total, 120 hours of data were collected from participants and analyzed. The accuracy of self-reported smoking was approximately 78% (96/123). Our model was successful in detecting 100 of 123 (81%) smoking sessions recorded by participants. After eliminating sessions from the participants that did not adhere to study protocols, the true positive detection rate of the smartwatch based-detection increased to more than 90%. During the 120 hours of combined observation time, only 22 false positive smoking sessions were detected resulting in a 2.8% false positive rate.
   Conclusions: Smartwatch technology can provide an accurate, nonintrusive means of monitoring smoking behavior in natural contexts. The use of machine learning algorithms for passively detecting smoking sessions may enrich ecological momentary assessment protocols and cessation intervention studies that often rely on self-reported behaviors and may not allow for targeted data collection and communications around smoking events.

AB  - The heart disease (HD) is very fatal in nature and comparatively takes more number of lives across the world. To save lives from the HD, early and robust detection method is essential. The HD of a subject can be diagnosed by clinical test attributes, the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal, heart sound signal, impedance cardiography (ICG), magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography (CT). In this paper, the problem of detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) using ECG signal as the prime source has been undertaken by developing four different deep learning (DL) models such as autoencoder (AE), radial basis function network (RBFN), self organizing map (SOM) and restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Two public arrhythmia datasets: PTB-ECG and MIT-BIH have been used for training and validation of the proposed models. Further, an ensemble classification model has been developed by combining two best performing AE and SOM models using the principle of majority voting. Simulation based experiments using two standard datasets demonstrate that the AE model providing accuracy, F1-score and area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.974, 0.932 and 0.922 for MIT-BIH dataset and 0.984, 0.967 and 0.932 for PTB-ECG datasets respectively outperforms the other three models. It is further observed that the proposed SOM AE ensemble model exhibits the best performance compared to the AE model with accuracy, F1-score and AUC values of 0.984, 0.971, 0.997 for MIT-BIH as well as 0.992, 0.986 and 0.995 for PTB-ECG datasets respectively. The detection models presented in this work can further be employed for other different diseases. The robustness and other performance measures can be obtained by applying larger and more imbalanced datasets to the DL models. In addition, internet of things (IoT) based diagnosis platform can be developed using proposed approach for online detection of CAD which would be beneficial for detecting remote CAD patients.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia affecting millions of people every year. This disease increases the likelihood of strokes, heart failure, and even death. While dedicated medical-grade electrocardiogram (ECG) devices can enable gold-standard analysis, these devices are expensive and require clinical settings. Recent advances in the capabilities of general-purpose smartphones and wearable technology equipped with photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors increase diagnostic accessibility for most populations. This work aims to develop a single model that can generalize AF classification across the modalities of ECG and PPG with a unified knowledge representation. This is enabled by approximating the transformation of signals obtained from low-cost wearable PPG sensors in terms of Pulse Rate Variability (PRV) to temporal Heart Rate Variability (HRV) features extracted from medical-grade ECG. This paper proposes a one-dimensional deep convolutional neural network that uses HRV-derived features for classifying 30-s heart rhythms as normal sinus rhythm or atrial fibrillation from both ECG and PPG-based sensors. The model is trained with three MIT-BIH ECG databases and is assessed on a dataset of unseen PPG signals acquired from wrist-worn wearable devices through transfer learning. The model achieved the aggregate binary classification performance measures of accuracy: 95.50%, sensitivity: 94.50%, and specificity: 96.00% across a five-fold cross-validation strategy on the ECG datasets. It also achieved 95.10% accuracy, 94.60% sensitivity, 95.20% specificity on an unseen PPG dataset. The results show considerable promise towards seamless adaptation of gold-standard ECG trained models for non-ambulatory AF detection with consumer wearable devices through HRV-based knowledge transfer.

AB  - Biomarkers including fasting blood sugar, heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure, etc. are essential in the heart disease (HD) diagnosing. Using wearable sensors, these measures are collected and applied as inputs to a deep learning (DL) model for HD diagnosis. However, it is observed that model accuracy weakens when the data gathered are scarce or imbalanced. Therefore, this work proposes two DL-based frameworks, GAN-1D-CNN, and GAN-Bi-LSTM. These frameworks contain: (1) a generative adversarial network (GAN) and (2) a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) or bi-directional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). The GAN model is utilized to augment the small and imbalanced dataset, which is the Cleveland dataset. The 1D-CNN and Bi-LSTM models are then trained using the enlarged dataset to diagnose HD. Unlike previous works, the proposed frameworks increase the dataset first to avoid the prediction bias caused by the limited data. The GAN-1D-CNN achieved 99.1% accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and 100% area under the curve (AUC). Similarly, the GAN-Bi-LSTM obtained 99.3% accuracy, 99.2% specificity, 99.3% sensitivity, 99.2% F1-score, and 100% AUC. Furthermore, time complexity of proposed frameworks is investigated with and without principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA method reduced prediction times for 61 samples using GAN-1D-CNN and GAN-Bi-LSTM to 68.8 and 74.8 ms, respectively. These results show that it is reliable to use our frameworks for augmenting limited data and predicting heart disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND Cancer survivors face increased risk of heart disease, including atrial fibrillation (AF). Certain types of technology, such as consumer wearable devices, can be useful to monitor for AF, but little is known about wearables and AF monitoring in cancer survivor populations.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to understand technology usage and preferences in cancer survivors with or at risk for AF, and to describe demographic factors associated with wearable device ownership in this population.
   METHODS Eligible patients completed a remote survey assessment regarding use of commercial wearable devices. The survey contained questions designed to assess commercial wearable device use, electronic health communications, and perceptions regarding the participant's cardiac health.
   RESULTS A total of 424 cancer survivors (mean age 74.2 years; 53.1% female; 98.8% white) were studied. Although most participants owned a smartphone (85.9%), only 31.8% owned a wearable device. Over half (53.5%) of cancer survivors were worried about their heart health. Overall, patients believed arrhythmias (79.7%) were the most important heart condition for a wearable to detect. Survivors reported being most willing to share blood pressure (95.6%) and heart rate (95.3%) data with their providers and were least willing to share information about their diet, weight, and physical activity using these devices.
   CONCLUSION Understanding factors such as device ownership, usage, and heart health concerns in cancer survivors can play an important role in improving cardiovascular monitoring and its accessibility. Long-term patient outcomes may be improved by incorporating wearable devices into routine care of cancer survivors.

AB  - Chronic illnesses like chronic respiratory disease, cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are threats to humans around the world. Among them, heart disease with disparate features or symptoms complicates diagnosis. Because of the emergence of smart wearable gadgets, fog computing and "Internet of Things" (IoT) solutions have become necessary for diagnosis. The proposed model integrates Edge-Fog-Cloud computing for the accurate and fast delivery of outcomes. The hardware components collect data from different patients. The heart feature extraction from signals is done to get significant features. Furthermore, the feature extraction of other attributes is also gathered. All these features are gathered and subjected to the diagnostic system using an Optimized Cascaded Convolution Neural Network (CCNN). Here, the hyperparameters of CCNN are optimized by the Galactic Swarm Optimization (GSO). Through the performance analysis, the precision of the suggested GSO-CCNN is 3.7%, 3.7%, 3.6%, 7.6%, 67.9%, 48.4%, 33%, 10.9%, and 7.6% more advanced than PSO-CCNN, GWO-CCNN, WOA-CCNN, DHOA-CCNN, DNN, RNN, LSTM, CNN, and CCNN, respectively. Thus, the comparative analysis of the suggested system ensures its efficiency over the conventional models.

AB  - Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and computer vision technologies find useful in different applications, especially in healthcare. IoT driven healthcare solutions provide intelligent solutions for enabling substantial reduction of expenses and improvisation of healthcare service quality. At the same time, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can be described as permanent blindness and eyesight damage because of the diabetic condition in humans. Accurate and early detection of DR could decrease the loss of damage. Computer-Aided Diagnoses (CAD) model based on retinal fundus image is a powerful tool to help experts diagnose DR. Some traditional Machine Learning (ML) based DR diagnoses model has currently existed in this study. The recent developments of Deep Learning (DL) and its considerable achievement over conventional ML algorithms for different applications make it easier to design effectual DR diagnosis model. With this motivation, this paper presents a novel IoT and DL enabled diabetic retinopathy diagnosis model (IoTDL-DRD) using retinal fundus images. The presented Internet of Things Deep Learning - Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis (IoTDL-DRD) technique utilizes IoT devices for data collection purposes and then transfers them to the cloud server to process them. Followed by, the retinal fundus images are preprocessed to remove noise and improve contrast level. Next, mayfly optimization based region growing (MFORG) based segmentation technique is utilized to detect lesion regions in the fundus image. Moreover, densely connected network (DenseNet) based feature extractor and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based classifier is used for effective DR diagnosis. Furthermore, the parameter optimization of the LSTM method can be carried out by Honey Bee Optimization (HBO) algorithm. For evaluating the improved DR diagnostic outcomes of the IoTDL-DRD technique, a comprehensive set of simulations were carried out. A wide ranging comparison study reported the superior performance of the proposed method.

AB  - Current healthcare applications commonly incorporate the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing ideas. IoT devices provide massive amounts of patient data in the healthcare industry. These data stored in the cloud are analyzed using mobile devices' built-in storage and processing power. The Internet of Medical Healthcare Things (IoMHT) integrates health monitoring components including sensors and medical equipment to remotely monitor patient records in order to provide more intelligent and sophisticated healthcare services. In this research, we analyze one of the deadliest illnesses with a high fatality rate worldwide, the chronic kidney disease (CKD), to provide the finest healthcare services possible to users of e-health and m-health applications by presenting the IoTC services based on healthcare delivery system for the prediction and observation of CKD with its severity level. The suggested architecture gathers patient data from linked IoT devices and saves it in the cloud alongside real-time data, pertinent medical records that are collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, and relevant medical documents. We further use a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier to predict CKD and its severity. To boost the effectiveness of the DNN classifier, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based feature selection technique is also applied. We compare the performance of the proposed model using different classification measures utilizing different classifiers. A Quick Flower Pollination Algorithm (QFPA)- (DNN)-based IoT and cloud-based CKD diagnosis model, is presented in this paper. The CKD diagnosis steps in the QFPA- DNN model involve data gathering, preparation, feature selection and classification stages.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are often characterized by their multifactorial complexity. This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (+/- 36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR.

AB  - Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing environments become commonly employed in several healthcare applications by the integration of monitoring things such as sensors and medical gadgets for observing remote patients. For availing of improved healthcare services, the huge count of data generated by IoT gadgets from the medicinal field can be investigated in the CC environment rather than relying on limited processing and storage resources. At the same time, earlier identification of chronic kidney disease (CKD) becomes essential to reduce the mortality rate significantly. This study develops an ensemble of deep learning based clinical decision support systems (EDL-CDSS) for CKD diagnosis in the IoT environment. The goal of the EDL-CDSS technique is to detect and classify different stages of CKD using the medical data collected by IoT devices and benchmark repositories. In addition, the EDL-CDSS technique involves the design of Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) technique for outlier detection process. Moreover, an ensemble of three models, namely, deep belief network (DBN), kernel extreme learning machine (KELM), and convolutional neural network with gated recurrent unit (CNN-GRU), are performed. Finally, quasi-oppositional butterfly optimization algorithm (QOBOA) is used for the hyperparameter tuning of the DBN and CNN-GRU models. A wide range of simulations was carried out and the outcomes are studied in terms of distinct measures.

AB  - A novel single-arm-worn ECG-based heart disease monitor is proposed in this paper. It is of a potential to provide continuous monitoring of different ECG metrics, and in this study, we focus on the duration of the QRS complex which is the central of an ECG heartbeat. Firstly, to avoid the low wearability induced by traditional chest-ECG or two-wrist ECG, we apply a highly wearable non-standard single-arm-ECG configuration. Afterwards, to estimate the QRS duration from noisy and weak non-standard single-arm ECG, we propose a new three-stage machine learning framework. It firstly identifies heartbeat locations (R peaks) by a support vector machine classifier, then uses a dynamic time warping approach to locate QRS patterns that are similar to a template learned by a K-medoids clustering method, and finally learns to use the arm-ECG-based QRS duration estimates to predict a standard chest-ECG-based QRS duration trend. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel system, based on data collected from five subjects using our customized hardware prototype and the non-standard signal-arm-ECG configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the a single-arm-worn ECG-based daily heart disease monitor, using advanced signal sensing and machine learning techniques.

AB  - This paper deals with measuring the Air Quality using MQ135 sensor along with Carbon Monoxide CO using MQ7 sensor. Measuring Air Quality is an important element for bringing awareness to take care of the future generations and for a healthier life. Based on this, Government of India has already taken certain measures to ban Single Stroke and Two Stroke Engine based motorcycles which are emitting high pollution. We are trying to implement a system using IoT platforms like Thingspeak or Cayenne in order to bring awareness to every individual about the harm we are doing to our environment. Already, New Delhi is remarked as the most pollution city in the world recording Air Quality above 300 PPM. We have used easiest platform like Thingspeak and set the dashboard to public such that everyone can come to know the Air Quality at the location where the system is installed. Machine Learning analysis brings us a lot of depth in understanding the information that we obtained from the data. Moreover, we are proviing a reducement of the cost of components versus the state of the art.

AB  - Background: Although electrocardiography is the gold standard for heart rate (HR) recording in clinical trials, the increasing availability of smartwatch-based HR monitors opens up possibilities for drug development studies. Smartwatches allow for inexpensive, unobtrusive, and continuous HR estimation for potential detection of treatment effects outside the clinic, during daily life.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate the repeatability and sensitivity of smartwatch-based HR estimates collected during a randomized clinical trial.
   Methods: The data were collected as part of a multiple-dose, investigator-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study of 12 patients with Parkinson disease. After a 6-day baseline period, 4 and 8 patients were treated for 7 days with an ascending dose of placebo and clenbuterol, respectively. Throughout the study, the smartwatch provided HR and sleep state estimates. The HR estimates were quantified as the 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentiles within awake and asleep segments. Linear mixed models were used to calculate the following: (1) the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of estimated sleep durations, (2) the ICC and minimum detectable effect (MDE) of the HR estimates, and (3) the effect sizes of the HR estimates.
   Results: Sleep duration was moderately repeatable (ICC=0.64) and was not significantly affected by study day (P=.83), clenbuterol (P=.43), and study day by clenbuterol (P=.73). Clenbuterol-induced changes were detected in the asleep HR as of the first night (+3.79 beats per minute [bpm], P=.04) and in the awake HR as of the third day (+8.79 bpm, P=.001). The median HR while asleep had the highest repeatability (ICC=0.70). The MDE (N=12) was found to be smaller when patients were asleep (6.8 bpm to 11.7 bpm) than while awake (10.7 bpm to 22.1 bpm). Overall, the effect sizes for clenbuterol-induced changes were higher while asleep (0.49 to 2.75) than while awake (0.08 to 1.94).
   Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of using smartwatch-based HR estimates to detect clenbuterol-induced changes during clinical trials. The asleep HR estimates were most repeatable and sensitive to treatment effects. We conclude that smartwatch-based HR estimates obtained during daily living in a clinical trial can be used to detect and track treatment effects.

AB  - Objective: A primary goal of acute stroke rehabilitation is to maximize functional recovery and help patients reintegrate safely in the home and community. However, not all patients have the same potential for recovery, making it difficult to set realistic therapy goals and to anticipate future needs for short- or long-term care. The objective of this study was to test the value of high-resolution data from wireless, wearable motion sensors to predict post-stroke ambulation function following inpatient stroke rehabilitation. Method: Supervised machine learning algorithms were trained to classify patients as either household or community ambulators at discharge based on information collected upon admission to the inpatient facility (N=33-35). Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor data recorded from the ankles and the pelvis during a brief walking bout at admission (10 meters, or 60 seconds walking) improved the prediction of discharge ambulation ability over a traditional prediction model based on patient demographics, clinical information, and performance on standardized clinical assessments. Results: Models incorporating IMU data were more sensitive to patients who changed ambulation category, improving the recall of community ambulators at discharge from 85% to 89-93%. Conclusions: This approach demonstrates significant potential for the early prediction of post-rehabilitation walking outcomes in patients with stroke using small amounts of data from three wearable motion sensors. Clinical Impact: Accurately predicting a patient's functional recovery early in the rehabilitation process would transform our ability to design personalized care strategies in the clinic and beyond. This work contributes to the development of low-cost, clinically-implementable prognostic tools for data-driven stroke treatment.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease which is characterized by a permanently high blood sugar level. A distinction is made between two forms: Type 1 diabetes and Type 2 diabetes. It is believed that there are around 415 million people between the ages of 20 and 79 worldwide who have some form of diabetes illness today. In Europe, over 60 million people are diabetic, a diabetes incidence of 10.3% of men and 9.6% of women is estimated. The prevalence of diabetes is increasing among all ages in the European Region, mainly due to increases in overweight and obesity, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity. A huge people in this population have type 2 diabetes, and the numbers will continue to rise over the next few years. So one can speak of a real widespread disease. The problem is not only the increased blood sugar, but also complications and accompanying diseases such as heart attack, stroke, or diabetic foot. However, as a type 2 diabetic, we can significantly influence the course of the disease and the success of therapy. To do this, it is important that we early detect the person that have (or likely have) a serious problem or an emergent case, and know about it as fast as possible. Early detection and treatment of this disease are very important to help diabetics live a healthy and near normal life. It can also help to avoid several serious complications. In addition, the evolution of wearable and Internet of Things medical devices can help to collect various health data for diagnosis using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we present an IoT-based system architecture which ensures the collection of patient data in order to predict serious cases of diabetes. To secure data, Blockchain and IPFS are used, and to analyze data, we propose a statistical-based method for predictions. The process is as follows. First, data were collected from IoT devices, and a dataset was constructed and stored using IPFS. Then, the data will be scaled and filtered using noise-invariant data expansion. Next, an adaptive random forest algorithm is made in order to train data on the training dataset, and people with diabetes were classified using the proposed model. Three datasets were used, namely, the Pima Indian diabetes dataset, the Frankfurt Hospital diabetes dataset, and the last is the fusion of these two datasets. Finally, the performance of the method was evaluated and compared with other recent prediction methods. Based on the experiment result, an accuracy of 85.9%, 99.5%, and 99.8% has been achieved based on the three datasets, respectively. Thus, the model can be used to predict and alert physicians or hospitals serious cases that need urgent reactions.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia affecting 8-10% of the population older than 80 years old. The importance of early diagnosis of atrial fibrillation has been broadly recognized since arrhythmias significantly increase the risk of stroke, heart failure and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with reduced cardiac function. However, the prevalence of atrial fibrillation is often underestimated due to the high frequency of clinically silent atrial fibrillation as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, both of which are hard to catch by routine physical examination or 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The development of wearable devices has provided a reliable way for healthcare providers to uncover undiagnosed atrial fibrillation in the population, especially those most at risk. Furthermore, with the advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the technology is now able to utilize the database in assisting detection of arrhythmias from the data collected by the devices. In this review study, we compare the different wearable devices available on the market and review the current advancement in artificial intelligence in diagnosing atrial fibrillation. We believe that with the aid of the progressive development of technologies, the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation shall be made more effectively and accurately in the near future.

AB  - Evaluating patient progress and making discharge decisions regarding inpatient medical rehabilitation rely upon the standard clinical assessments administered by trained clinicians. Wearable inertial sensors can offer more objective measures of patient movement and progress. We undertook a study to investigate the contribution of wearable sensor data to predict discharge functional independence measure (FIM) scores for 20 patients at an inpatient rehabilitation facility. The FIM utilizes a seven-point ordinal scale to measure patient independence while performing several activities of daily living, such as walking, grooming, and bathing. Wearable inertial sensor data were collected from ecological ambulatory tasks at two time points mid-stay during inpatient rehabilitation. Machine learning algorithms were trained with sensor-derived features and clinical information obtained from medical records at admission to the inpatient facility. While models trained only with clinical features predicted discharge scores well, we were able to achieve an even higher level of prediction accuracy when also including the wearable sensor-derived features. Correlations as high as 0.97 for leave-one-out cross validation predicting discharge FIM motor scores are reported.

AB  - In recent years, cardiovascular disease becomes a prominent source of death. The web services connect other medical equipments and the computers via internet for exchanging and combining the data in novel ways. The accurate prediction of heart disease is important to prevent cardiac patients prior to heart attack. The main drawback of heart disease is delay in identifying the disease in the early stage. This objective is obtained by using the machine learning method with rich healthcare information on heart diseases. In this paper, the smart healthcare method is proposed for the prediction of heart disease using Biogeography optimization algorithm and Mexican hat wavelet to enhance Dragonfly algorithm optimization with mixed kernel based extreme learning machine (BMDA-MKELM) approach. Here, data is gathered from the two devices such as sensor nodes as well as the electronic medical records. The android based design is utilized to gather the patient data and the reliable cloud-based scheme for the data storage. For further evaluation for the prediction of heart disease, data are gathered from cloud computing services. At last, BMDA-MKELM based prediction scheme is capable to classify cardiovascular diseases. In addition to this, the proposed prediction scheme is compared with another method with respect to measures such as accuracy, precision, specificity, and sensitivity. The experimental results depict that the proposed approach achieves better results for the prediction of heart disease when compared with other methods.

AB  - Graves' disease is the most common form of hyperthyroidism in the pediatric population. While the most prevalent symptoms seen in children with Graves' disease include goiter and excessive sweating (Minamitani et al., 2017), diagnosis is frequently delayed due to presentation with non-specific symptoms (Leger et al., 2018). This case report is of a 12-year-old female who presented to her pediatrician with a one month history of episodes of tachycardia both with physical exertion and at rest. Notably, these episodes were discovered on her electronic smartwatch by its heart rate monitoring feature. Further pertinent positives elicited in the patient's review of systems included increasing anxiety, diaphoresis, intermittent hand tremors, and recent weight loss. These findings led to further workup that included thyroid studies, culminating in a diagnosis of Graves' disease. Indeed, this patient's smartwatch aided in her initial presentation to her physician and allowed for prompt workup and diagnosis. There exist limited studies to date on the use of smartwatches to detect cardiac-related conditions in children, which may be due to the absence of Food and Drug Administration approval for certain cardiac-related smartwatch features in this patient population.(c) 2022 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) plays an essential role in the area of the healthcare system. IoT devices provide information about patients in the healthcare monitoring framework. Moreover, patients can examine their health with smart devices and hence IoT is a major factor in all aspects of the health care management system. Breast cancer is a deadly cancer in women and the detection of this disease at the primary stage increases the survival rate. Due to the computational complexity associated with acquiring features, classification results generated from the existing methods are unsatisfactory and hence it is important to design a method using deep learning concepts for classifying cancer disease. An efficient and robust classification model named Student Psychology Whale Optimization-based Deep maxout network with optimization (SPWO-based Deep maxout network) classifies breast cancer disease. The advantage of using a Deep maxout network is that it effectively learns intrinsic features from the data. The weight factor of the deep learning model is updated with respect to iteration based on the fitness measure that in turn results in higher results by acquiring a minimal error value. However, the proposed model obtains outstanding accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in terms of testing with the values of 0.931, 0.953, and 0.915 with 100 nodes.

AB  - Hypoxemia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been recognized as a threat to life. Nonetheless, information regarding the association between pre-dialytic pulse oximeter saturation (SpO2) level, OSA and mortality risks remains mysterious in patients with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Bioclinical characteristics and laboratory features were recorded at baseline. Pre-dialytic SpO2 was detected using a novel microchip LED oximetry, and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score greater than 10 indicated OSA. Non-adjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) of all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality were analyzed for pre-dialytic SpO2, OSA and potential risk factors. During 2152.8 patient-months of follow-up, SpO2 was associated with incremental risks of all-cause and CV death (HR: 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82-0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80-0.98), respectively). The association between OSA and CV mortality was significant (HR: 3.19 (95% CI: 1.19-9.38). In the multivariate regression analysis, pre-dialytic SpO2 still had an increase in all-cause and CV death risk (HR: 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79-0.98), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.96), respectively). Considering the high prevalence of silent hypoxia in the post COVID-19 era, a lower pre-dialytic SpO2 level and severe OSA warn clinicians to assess potential CV risks. In light of clinical accessibility, the microchip LED oximetry could be developed as a wearable device within smartphone technologies and used as a routine screen tool for patient safety in the medical system.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic disease that is escalating day by day and requires 24/7 continuous management. It may cause many complications, precisely when a patient moves, which may risk their and other drivers' and pedestrians' lives. Recent research shows diabetic drivers are the main cause of major road accidents. Several wireless non-invasive health monitoring sensors, such as wearable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors, in combination with machine learning approaches at cloud servers, can be beneficial for monitoring drivers' diabetic conditions on travel to reduce the accident rate. Furthermore, the emergency condition of the driver needs to be shared for the safety of life. With the emergence of the vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET), vehicles can exchange useful information with nearby vehicles and roadside units that can be further communicated with health monitoring sources via GPS and Internet connectivity. This work proposes a novel approach to the health care of drivers' diabetes monitoring using wearable sensors, machine learning, and VANET technology. Several machine learning (ML) algorithms assessed the proposed prediction model using the cross-validation method. Performance metrics precision, recall, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, MCC, and AROC are used to validate our method. The result shows random forest (RF) outperforms and achieves the highest accuracy compared to other algorithms and previous approaches ranging from 90.3% to 99.5%.

AB  - One of the most important physiological parameters of the cardiovascular circulatory system is Blood Pressure. Several diseases are related to long-term abnormal blood pressure, i.e., hypertension; therefore, the early detection and assessment of this condition are crucial. The identification of hypertension, and, even more the evaluation of its risk stratification, by using wearable monitoring devices are now more realistic thanks to the advancements in Internet of Things, the improvements of digital sensors that are becoming more and more miniaturized, and the development of new signal processing and machine learning algorithms. In this scenario, a suitable biomedical signal is represented by the PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (PPG) signal. It can be acquired by using a simple, cheap, and wearable device, and can be used to evaluate several aspects of the cardiovascular system, e.g., the detection of abnormal heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and so on. In this paper, we take into account the Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation Data Set that contains, among others, PPG signals coming from a set of subjects, as well as the Blood Pressure values of the latter that is the hypertension level. Our aim is to investigate whether or not machine learning methods applied to these PPG signals can provide better results for the non-invasive classification and evaluation of subjects' hypertension levels. To this aim, we have availed ourselves of a wide set of machine learning algorithms, based on different learning mechanisms, and have compared their results in terms of the effectiveness of the classification obtained.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can provide actionable insights for clinical decisionmaking and managing chronic diseases. The treatment and management of complex chronic diseases, such as diabetes, stands to benefit from novel AI algorithms analyzing the frequent real-time streaming data and the occasional medical diagnostics and laboratory test results reported in electronic health records (EHR). Novel algorithms are needed to develop trustworthy, responsible, reliable, and robust AI techniques that can handle the imperfect and imbalanced data of EHRs and inconsistencies or discrepancies with free-living self-reported information. The challenges and applications of AI for two problems in the healthcare domain were explored in this work. First, we introduced novel AI algorithms for EHRs designed to be fair and unbiased while accommodating privacy concerns in predicting treatments and outcomes. Then, we studied the innovative approach of using machine learning to improve automated insulin delivery systems through analyzing real-time information from wearable devices and historical data to identify informative trends and patterns in free-living data. Application examples in the treatment of diabetes demonstrate the benefits of AI tools for medical and health informatics.

AB  - The spatial QRS-T angle is a promising health indicator for risk stratification of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Thus far, the angle is estimated solely from 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems uncomfortable for ambulatory monitoring. Methods to estimate QRS-T angles from reduced-lead ECGs registered with consumer healthcare devices would, therefore, facilitate ambulatory monitoring. (1) Objective: Develop a method to estimate spatial QRS-T angles from reduced-lead ECGs. (2) Approach: We designed a deep learning model to locate the QRS and T wave vectors necessary for computing the QRS-T angle. We implemented an original loss function to guide the model in the 3D space to search for each vector's coordinates. A gradual reduction of ECG leads from the largest publicly available dataset of clinical 12-lead ECG recordings (PTB-XL) is used for training and validation. (3) Results: The spatial QRS-T angle can be estimated from leads {I, II, aVF, V2} with sufficient accuracy (absolute mean and median errors of 11.4 degrees and 7.3 degrees) for detecting abnormal angles without sacrificing patient comfortability. (4) Significance: Our model could enable ambulatory monitoring of spatial QRS-T angles using patch- or textile-based ECG devices. Populations at risk of SCD, like chronic cardiac and kidney disease patients, might benefit from this technology.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is commonly employed to detect different kinds of diseases in the health sector. Presently, disease detection is performed using MRI images, X-rays, CT scans, and so on for diagnosing the diseases. The manual detection process is found to be time-consuming and may result in detection errors that affect the diagnosis. Hence, there is a need for an automatic system for which the deep learning methods gain a major interest. Hence, the idea to combine deep learning and disease prediction to effectively predict the disease is initiated. In this research, the deep learning method is combined with deep learning for the effective prediction of diseases, where the IoT network is employed in the data collection from the patients. The proposed cuckoo-based deep convolutional long-short term memory (deep convLSTM) classifier is employed for disease prediction, where the cuckoo search optimization is utilized for tuning the deep convLSTM classifier. The proposed method is compared with the conventional methods, and it achieved a training percentage of 97.591%, 95.874%, and 97.094%, respectively, for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The comparative analysis proved that the proposed method obtained higher accuracy than other methods.

AB  - Recent innovative treatment and diagnostic methods developed for heart and circulatory system disorders do not provide the desired results as they are not supported by long-term patient follow-up. Continuous medical support in a clinic or hospital is often not feasible in elderly or aging populations; yet, collecting medical data is still required to maintain a high-quality of life. In this study, a smart wearable system design called Cardiovascular Disease Monitoring (CVDiMo), which provides continuous medical monitoring and creates a health profile with the risk of disease over time. Systematic tests were performed with analysis of six different biosignals from two different test groups with 30 participants. In addition to examining the biosignals of patients, using the physical activity results and stress levels deduced from the emotional state analysis achieved a higher performance in risk estimation. In our experiments, the highest accuracy of determining the short-term health status was obtained as 96%.

AB  - Much attention has been given to the Internet of Things (IoT) by citizens, industries, governments, and universities for applications like smart buildings, environmental monitoring, health care and so on. With IoT, network connectivity is facilitated between smart devices from anyplace and anytime. IoT-based health monitoring systems are gaining popularity and acceptance for continuous monitoring and detect health abnormalities from the data collected. Electrocardiographic (ECG) signals are widely used for heart diseases detection. A novel method has been proposed in this work for ECG monitoring using IoT techniques. In this work, a two-stage approach is employed. In the first stage, a routing protocol based on Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Routing by Energy and Link quality (REL) for IoT healthcare platform is proposed for efficient data collection, and in the second stage, classification of ECG for Arrhythmia. Furthermore, this work has evaluated Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs)based approach for ECG signals classification. Deep-ECG will use a deep CNN to extract critical features and then compare through evaluation of simple and fast distance functions in order to obtain an efficient classification of heart abnormalities. For the identification of abnormal data, this work has proposed techniques for the classification of ECG data, which has been obtained from mobile watch users. For experimental verification of the proposed methods, the Beth Israel HosDatabase was used for evaluation. Results confirm the presented method's superior performance with regards to the accuracy of classification. The CNN achieved an accuracy of 91.92% and has a higher accuracy of 4.98% for the SVM and 2.68% for the ANN.

AB  - Simple Summary Skin cancer is a life-threatening condition. It is difficult to diagnose in its early stages; therefore, we proposed an easy-to-use telemedicine device to tackle skin cancer without expert intervention. The deep learning model automatically detects skin cancer patches on lesions with a credit-card-sized device named Raspberry Pi and a small camera. This paper also presents a digital hair removal algorithm to enhance the quality of medical images for better analysis by medical experts and AI methods. Our method does not need an expert operator; even ordinary people can use it with the instruction manual. It will be useful for developing countries or remote places when there is a scarcity of oncologists. Cancer remains a deadly disease. We developed a lightweight, accurate, general-purpose deep learning algorithm for skin cancer classification. Squeeze-MNet combines a Squeeze algorithm for digital hair removal during preprocessing and a MobileNet deep learning model with predefined weights. The Squeeze algorithm extracts important image features from the image, and the black-hat filter operation removes noise. The MobileNet model (with a dense neural network) was developed using the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset to fine-tune the model. The proposed model is lightweight; the prototype was tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 Internet of Things device with a Neo pixel 8-bit LED ring; a medical doctor validated the device. The average precision (AP) for benign and malignant diagnoses was 99.76% and 98.02%, respectively. Using our approach, the required dataset size decreased by 66%. The hair removal algorithm increased the accuracy of skin cancer detection to 99.36% with the ISIC dataset. The area under the receiver operating curve was 98.9%.

AB  - Human walking is a very challenging task and always requires rigorous practice. It is a learning process that involves the complex coordination of the brain and lower limbs. The bipedal robots that mimic the human morphological structure to produce human similar walking, are not capable of producing an efficient walk. Due to walking challenges and structural differences, a robot cannot walk like a human being. In this research, to achieve the aforementioned objective to produce a human similar walk, human lower extremity activities are considered to understand walking behaviour. The experiment involves different walking styles on different terrains. To capture the learning process of bipedal robot locomotion, a deep learning-based ensemble classifier is introduced for human lower activities recognition. To understand the learning process seven different walking activities are considered for analysis purposes. An Inertial measurement unit (IMU) is used as a wearable device due to its small form factor and unobtrusive nature to capture the walking movement of different lower limbs joints. Three public datasets viz. mHealth, OU-ISIR similar action and HAPT inertial sensor data sets are considered for this study. To classify the activities, 2 different deep learning models namely convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) are used. To generalize the results, an ensemble of different classifiers is implemented. The Classifier has reported accuracy of 99.25%, 88.48% and 97.44%, respectively, on the aforementioned data sets. This work can be utilized for elderly subjects' postural stability, rehabilitation of patients post-stroke and trauma, generation of robot walk trajectories in cluttered environment and reconstruction of impaired walking.

AB  - Diagnosing cardiovascular disease (CVD) in its early stages remains a challenge despite the existence of all medical technologies and devices that are being used. Besides the digitised form of collecting and organising data, prediction and diagnosis are two stumbling blocks in CVD. This study explores statistical machine learning models with a multimedia health care approach using AI to predict risk factors of heart diseases associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study investigates an efficacy of a mathematical model to perform attribute evaluation using information criteria-based selection in LASSO regression. The present study implements the deep learning algorithm using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier with Gaussian process classification (GPC) that provides probabilistic predictions in terms of linear and non-linear functions. The performance of the classifier is evaluated using precision, recall and accuracy metrics. The proposed classification model yields 93.59% accuracy of 10 cross-validations assorted with sigmoid function for better analysis.

AB  - Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) has proven to be a promising non-invasive technique for fluid monitoring in haemodialysis (HD) patients. While current BIS-based monitoring of pre- and post-dialysis fluid status utilizes benchtop devices, designed for intramural use, advancements in micro-electronics have enabled the development of wearable bioimpedance systems. Wearable systems meanwhile can offer a similar frequency range for current injection as commercially available benchtop devices. This opens opportunities for unobtrusive longitudinal fluid status monitoring, including transcellular fluid shifts, with the ultimate goal of improving fluid management, thereby lowering mortality and improving quality of life for HD patients. Ultra-miniaturized wearable devices can also offer simultaneous acquisition of multiple other parameters, including haemodynamic parameters. Combination of wearable BIS and additional longitudinal multiparametric data may aid in the prevention of both haemodynamic instability as well as fluid overload. The opportunity to also acquire data during interdialytic periods using wearable devices likely will give novel pathophysiological insights and the development of smart (predicting) algorithms could contribute to personalizing dialysis schemes and ultimately to autonomous (nocturnal) home dialysis. This review provides an overview of current research regarding wearable bioimpedance, with special attention to applications in end-stage kidney disease patients. Furthermore, we present an outlook on the future use of wearable bioimpedance within dialysis practice.

Hence, new solutions for preventing, detecting and supporting persons with AD are required. The aim of this paper is to develop a prototype that provides psychological support services and ensures secure sending of information that can be investigated by a family member to protect the person with AD. The designed wearable prototype is able to classify the detected images into two categories including family/non family member based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Moreover, our prototype enables tracking the location of the person with AD. Furthermore, our IoT prototype protects the images captured by the webcam through the steganography technique that allows the recipient to decode the original image using a key. Another feature of the developed prototype concerns the possibility of communication via voice messages between the person with AD and his/her member. Additionally, our prototype integrates Google assistant for supporting the persons with AD and therefore answering his/her questions, reducing social isolation and predicting his/her psychological status. So far, our prototype tracks the location of the person with AD and sends an alert if the person leaves a specified area. Our prototype is useful for persons who are affected by mild and moderate AD. It supports them for remembering their family members and recognizing other people after decrypting the extra information hidden in the images. Our results show that our prototype is effective for detecting the images of the family members of a person with AD while ensuring a high accuracy and precision compared to other benchmark techniques.

AB  - The problem of decreased balance caused by injury, illness, or aging is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. The traditional functional balance assessment method is highly time-consuming and inefficient, as well as being susceptible to measurement errors caused by personal subjective factors. This study proposes a system that can rapidly, conveniently, and accurately predict a participant's Berg balance scale (BBS) score without professional supervision. The proposed system uses a wearable inertial sensing device combined with machine learning to predict the BBS score of a test participant. In the beginning, the participants were asked to wear inertial sensing devices on seven parts of the body and perform 17 test tasks. The wearable device locations and the test tasks were ranked by importance and further reduced wearable devices and the test tasks. Eventually, the participant is only required to wear an inertial sensing device on their left thigh and perform two simple test tasks, namely "placing an alternate foot on a stool" and "standing on one foot (right foot)," to obtain their BBS score. In this study, the proposed system has a high level of accuracy for predicting BBS scores. The experimental results indicate that the mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed system was 1.274. Moreover, this study provided some important information as a reference for future research on functional balance, including feature sets selection, regression model selection, wearable device locations ranking, and test tasks ranking. The researchers can use that information to design their experiment.

AB  - Rapid introduction of new diseases and the severity improvement of existing dead diseases due to the bad food habits and lacking of awareness over the health conscious food items those are available in the market. The Internet of Things (IoT) gets more attention for reducing the disease severity by knowing the current status of their disease according to the dynamic inputs of human body through IoT devices today. Moreover, the combination of IoT and cloud computing technologies are playing major roles in e-health services. In this scenario, security is a major issue in the process of data storage and communication. For this purpose, we propose a new e-healthcare system for monitoring the dead disease level by using the technologies such as IoT and Cloud with the help of deep learning approach and fuzzy rules with temporal features. In this system, the medical data is retrieved from various located patients who are utilizing the e-healthcare assisting devices. First, the retrieved and encrypted data is stored in cloud by applying a newly proposed secured cloud storage algorithm. Second, the stored data can be retrieved the data as original data by applying the decryption process. Third, a new cloud framework is introduced for predicting the status of heart beat rates and diabetes levels by using the medical data that is created by applying the UCI Repository dataset. In addition, a new deep learning approach which applies the Convolutional Neural Network for predicting the disease severity. The experimental results are obtained by conducting various experiments for the proposed model by using the dataset and the hospital patient records. The proposed model results outperforms the available disease prediction systems in terms of prediction accuracy.

AB  - Background: Frailty can inform management approaches for individuals with COPD. However, inpatient measures of frailty are seldom employed because they are time-consuming or inapplicable for bed-bound patients. We investigated the feasibility and potential of an innovative sensor-based upper-extremity function (UEF) test for frailty assessment in predicting adverse outcomes.
   Methods: Hospitalized patients with COPD-related exacerbations (aged >= 55 years) were recruited and performed the UEF test within 24 hours of admission. UEF parameters were obtained and fed into our previously developed frailty model to calculate frailty status (non-frail, pre-frail, and frail) and frailty score (0: extreme resilience to 1: extreme frailty). In-hospital (length of stay) and post-discharge (discharge disposition, 30-day exacerbation with treatment, and all-cause 30-day readmission) outcomes were collected. Associations between UEF frailty and outcomes were investigated using ANOVA and logistic models adjusted for demographic data.
   Results: In total, 42 patients were recruited. All participants were able to perform the UEF test. Based on UEF, participants were stratified into three groups of non-frail (n=6, frailty score =0.18 +/- 0.09), pre-frail (n=14, frailty score =0.45 +/- 0.09), and frail (n=22, frailty score =0.78 +/- 0.11). Both frailty status and frailty score were significantly associated with unfavorable discharge disposition (P<0.005) and all-cause 30-day readmission (P<0.05). On the other hand, UEF frailty measures were associated with neither hospital length of stay (P>0.5) nor 30-day exacerbation with treatment (P>0.70). Age was only significantly associated with unfavorable discharge disposition (P=0.048).
   Conclusion: In agreement with previous work, the current findings underline the importance of measuring frailty for risk-stratification of COPD patients. The UEF was feasible and easily performed among all hospitalized COPD patients. In this study, we have shown that, using our quick and objective frailty measures, COPD patients can be prospectively risk-stratified in terms of unfavorable discharge disposition and all-cause 30-day readmissions.

AB  - Posterior Cortical Atrophy is a rare but significant form of dementia which affects people's visual ability before their memory. This is often misdiagnosed as an eyesight rather than brain sight problem. This paper aims to address the frequent, initial misdiagnosis of this disease as a vision problem through the use of an intelligent, cost-effective, wearable system, alongside diagnosis of the more typical Alzheimer's Disease. We propose low-level features constructed from the IMU data gathered from 35 participants, while they performed a stair climbing and descending task in a real-world simulated environment. We demonstrate that with these features the machine learning models predict dementia with 87.02% accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate how system parameters, such as number of sensors, affect the prediction accuracy. This lays the groundwork for a simple clinical test to enable detection of dementia which can be carried out in the wild.

AB  - Background: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers.
   Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff.
   Methods: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).
   Results: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification.
   Conclusions: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation.

AB  - Over the last few years, the huge amount of data represented a major obstacle to data analysis. Big data implies that the volume of data undergoes a faster progress than computational speeds, thereby demanding a larger data storage capacity. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a main source of data that is closely related to big data, as the former extends to a variety of fields such as healthcare, entertainment, and disaster control. Despite the different advantages associated with the composition of Big Data analytics and IoT, there are a number of complex difficulties and issues involved that need to be resolved and managed to ensure an accurate data analysis. Some of these solutions include the utilization of map-reduce techniques, processing, and large data scale, particularly for the relatively less time that this method requires to process large data from the Internet of Things. Machine learning algorithms of this kind are often implemented in the healthcare sector. Medical facilities need to be advanced so that more appropriate decisions can be made in terms of patient diagnosis and treatment options. In this work, two datasets have been used: the first set, used in the prediction of heart diseases, obtained an accuracy rate of 84.5 for RF and 83 for J48, whereas the second dataset is related to weather stations (automated sensors) and obtained accuracy rates of 88.5 and 86.5 for RF and J48, respectively.

AB  - Background Recent innovations have the potential to disrupt the current paradigm for kidney failure treatment. The US Food and Drug Administration is committed to incorporating valid scientific evidence about how patients weigh the benefits and risks of new devices into their decision making, but to date, premarket submission of patient preference information (PPI) has been limited for kidney devices. With input from stakeholders, we developed a survey intended to yield valid PPI, capturing how patients trade off the potential benefits and risks of wearable dialysis devices and in-center hemodialysis.Methods We conducted concept elicitation interviews with individuals receiving dialysis to inform instrument content. After instrument drafting, we conducted two rounds of pretest interviews to evaluate survey face validity, comprehensibility, and perceived relevance. We pilot tested the survey with in-center hemodialysis patients to assess comprehensibility and usability further. Throughout, we used participant input to guide survey refinements.Results Thirty-six individuals receiving in-center or home dialysis participated in concept elicitation (N=20) and pretest (N=16) interviews. Participants identified reduced fatigue, lower treatment burden, and enhanced freedom as important benefits of a wearable device, and many expressed concerns about risks related to device disconnection-specifically bleeding and infection. We drafted a survey that included descriptions of the risks of serious bleeding and serious infection and an assessment of respondent willingness to wait for a safer device. Input from pretest interviewees led to various instrument modifications, including treatment descriptions, item wording, and risk-level explanations. Pilot testing of the updated survey among 24 in-center hemodialysis patients demonstrated acceptable survey comprehensibility and usability, although 50% of patients required some assistance.Conclusions The final survey is a 54-item web-based instrument that will yield estimates of the maximal acceptable risk for the described wearable device and willingness to wait for wearable devices with lower risk.

AB  - Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited red blood cell disorder affecting millions worldwide, and it results in many potential medical complications throughout the life course. The hallmark of SCD is pain. Many patients experience daily chronic pain as well as intermittent, unpredictable acute vaso-occlusive painful episodes called pain crises. These pain crises often require acute medical care through the day hospital or emergency department. Following presentation, a number of these patients are subsequently admitted with continued efforts of treatment focused on palliative pain control and hydration for management. Mitigating pain crises is challenging for both the patients and their providers, given the perceived unpredictability and subjective nature of pain.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to show the feasibility of using objective, physiologic measurements obtained from a wearable device during an acute pain crisis to predict patient-reported pain scores (in an app and to nursing staff) using machine learning techniques.
   Methods: For this feasibility study, we enrolled 27 adult patients presenting to the day hospital with acute pain. At the beginning of pain treatment, each participant was given a wearable device (Microsoft Band 2) that collected physiologic measurements. Pain scores from our mobile app, Technology Resources to Understand Pain Assessment in Patients with Pain, and those obtained by nursing staff were both used with wearable signals to complete time stamp matching and feature extraction and selection. Following this, we constructed regression and classification machine learning algorithms to build between-subject pain prediction models.
   Results: Patients were monitored for an average of 3.79 (SD 2.23) hours, with an average of 5826 (SD 2667) objective data values per patient. As expected, we found that pain scores and heart rate decreased for most patients during the course of their stay. Using the wearable sensor data and pain scores, we were able to create a regression model to predict subjective pain scores with a root mean square error of 1.430 and correlation between observations and predictions of 0.706. Furthermore, we verified the hypothesis that the regression model outperformed the classification model by comparing the performances of the support vector machines (SVM) and the SVM for regression.
   Conclusions: The Microsoft Band 2 allowed easy collection of objective, physiologic markers during an acute pain crisis in adults with SCD. Features can be extracted from these data signals and matched with pain scores. Machine learning models can then use these features to feasibly predict patient pain scores.

AB  - In this study, we present a cohort study involving 106 COPD patients using portable environmental sensor nodes with attached air pollution sensors and activity-related sensors, as well as daily symptom records and peak flow measurements to monitor patients' activity and personal exposure to air pollution. This is the first study which attempts to predict COPD symptoms based on personal air pollution exposure. We developed a system that can detect COPD patients' symptoms one day in advance of symptoms appearing. We proposed using the Probabilistic Latent Component Analysis (PLCA) model based on 3-dimensional and 4-dimensional spectral dictionary tensors for personalised and population monitoring, respectively. The model is combined with Linear Dynamic Systems (LDS) to track the patients' symptoms. We compared the performance of PLCA and PLCA-LDS models against Random Forest models in the identification of COPD patients' symptoms, since tree-based classifiers were used for remote monitoring of COPD patients in the literature. We found that there was a significant difference between the classifiers, symptoms and the personalised versus population factors. Our results show that the proposed PLCA-LDS-3D model outperformed the PLCA and the RF models between 4 and 20% on average. When we used only air pollutants as input, the PLCA-LDS-3D forecasting results in personalised and population models were 48.67 and 36.33% accuracy for worsening of lung capacity and 38.67 and 19% accuracy for exacerbation of COPD patients' symptoms, respectively. We have shown that indicators of the quality of an individual's environment, specifically air pollutants, are as good predictors of the worsening of respiratory symptoms in COPD patients as a direct measurement.

AB  - Worldwide, many elders are suffering from Alzheimer???s disease (AD). The elders with AD exhibit various abnormalities in their activities, such as sleep disturbances, wandering aimlessly, forgetting activities, etc., which are the strong signs and symptoms of AD progression. Recognizing these symptoms in advance could assist to a quicker diagnosis and treatment and to prevent the progression of Disease to the next stage. The proposed method aims to detect the behavioral abnormalities found in Daily activities of AD patients (ADP) using wearables. In the proposed work, a publicly available dataset collected using wearables is applied. Currently, no real-world data is available to illustrate the daily activities of ADP. Hence, the proposed method has synthesized the wearables data according to the abnormal activities of ADP. In the proposed work, multi-headed (MH) architectures such as MH Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory Network (CNN-LSTM), MH one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and MH two dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN) as well as conventional methods, namely CNN-LSTM, 1D-CNN, 2D-CNN have been implemented to model activity pattern. A multi-label prediction technique is applied to detect abnormal activities. The results obtained show that the proposed MH architectures achieve improved performance than the conventional methods. Moreover, the MH models for activity recognition perform better than the abnormality detection.

AB  - Smart healthcare serves as an innovative way for integrating sensors, Internet of things (IoT) and large scale analytics. A better patient monitoring reduces the costs of medical services to great extent, which opens up new frontiers or strategies for the sustainability of mankind in terms of data services, remote diagnosing/monitoring or the new kinds of treatments. However, Cloud computing is an on-demand service that provides storage, network, power to do intensive computing, intensive sharing of resources, but users should also deal with the privacy-related issues to the data stored in the cloud through data breaches. The current health care systems implemented on the cloud poses threat to the privacy of the data of the patients, since data breaches cost millions to billions of dollars to the health care institutions every year this problem can be taken care with the Fog computing (FC) based health care systems, where the fog technology offers more additional advantages like low latency, resource management, less power consumption, etc. The proposed system demonstrates the use of IoT, computing platforms (cloud/Fog) with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Fog layer extracts the attributes and filters the data collected about heart diseases, whereas cloud layer estimates the level of disease detection using the classifier algorithms Random forest and Naive Bayes. In terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and f-measure, the results suggest that Random Forest outperforms Naive Bayes.

AB  - The growing trend of obesity and overweight worldwide has reached epidemic proportions with one third of the global population now considered obese. This is having a significant medical impact on children and adults who are at risk of developing osteoarthritis, coronary heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancers, respiratory problems, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In an attempt to redress the issue, physical activity is being promoted as a fundamental component for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations for physical activity levels are issued by most governments as part of their public health measures. However, current techniques and protocols, including those used in laboratory settings, have been criticised. The main concern is that it is not feasible to use multiple pieces of measurement hardware, such as VO2 masks and heart rate monitors, to monitor children in free-living environments due to weight and encumbrance constraints. This has prompted research in the use of wearable sensing and machine learning technology to produce classifications for specific physical activity events. This paper builds on this approach and presents a supervised machine learning method that utilises data obtained from accelerometer sensors worn by children in free-living environments. Our results show that when using an artificial neural network algorithm it is possible to obtain an overall accuracy of 96% using four features from the initial dataset, with sensitivity and specificity values equal to 95% and 99% respectively. Expanding the dataset with interpolated cases, it was possible to improve on these results with 98.8% for accuracy, and 99% for sensitivity and specificity when four features were used.

AB  - Patient-generated health data provide a great opportunity for more detailed ambulatory monitoring and more personalized treatments in many diseases. In epilepsy, robust diagnostics applicable to the ambu-latory setting are needed as diagnosis and treatment decisions in current clinical practice are primarily reliant on patient self-reports, which are often inaccurate. Recent work using wearable devices has focused on methods to detect and forecast epileptic seizures. Whether wearable device signals may also contain information about the effect of antiseizure medications (ASMs), which may ultimately help to better monitor their efficacy, has not been evaluated yet. Here we systematically investigated the effect of ASMs on different data modalities (electrodermal activity, EDA, heart rate, HR, and heart rate variabil-ity, HRV) simultaneously recorded by a wearable device in 48 patients with epilepsy over several days in the epilepsy long-term monitoring unit at a tertiary hospital. All signals exhibited characteristic diurnal variations. HRV, but not HR or EDA-based metrics, were reduced by ASMs. By assessing multiple signals related to the autonomic nervous system simultaneously, our results provide novel insights into the effects of ASMs on the sympathetic and parasympathetic interplay in the setting of epilepsy and indicate the potential of easy-to-wear wearable devices for monitoring ASM action. Future work using longer data may investigate these metrics on multidien cycles and their utility for detecting seizures, assessing sei-zure risk, or informing treatment interventions.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

KW  - STROKE
AB  - Background
   Atrial Fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia worldwide with a global age adjusted prevalence of 0.5% in 2010. Anticoagulation treatment using warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants is effective in reducing the risk of AF-related stroke by approximately two-thirds and can provide a 10% reduction in overall mortality. There has been increased interest in detecting AF due to its increased incidence and the possibility to prevent AF-related strokes. Inexpensive consumer devices which measure the ECG may have the potential to accurately detect AF but do not generally incorporate diagnostic algorithms. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to improve patient outcomes particularly where diagnoses are made from large volumes or complex patterns of data such as in AF.
   Methods
   We designed a novel AF detection algorithm using a de-correlated Lorenz plot of 60 consecutive RR intervals. In order to reduce the volume of data, the resulting images were compressed using a wavelet transformation (JPEG200 algorithm) and the compressed images were used as input data to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. We used the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)-Beth Israel Hospital (BIH) Atrial Fibrillation database and the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database as training data and verified the algorithm performance using RR intervals collected using an inexpensive consumer heart rate monitor device (Polar-H7) in a case-control study.
   Results
   The SVM algorithm yielded excellent discrimination in the training data with a sensitivity of 99.2% and a specificity of 99.5% for AF. In the validation data, the SVM algorithm correctly identified AF in 79/79 cases; sensitivity 100% (95% CI 95.4%-100%) and non-AF in 328/336 cases; specificity 97.6% (95% CI 95.4%-99.0%).
   Conclusions
   An inexpensive wearable heart rate monitor and machine learning algorithm can be used to detect AF with very high accuracy and has the capability to transmit ECG data which could be used to confirm AF. It could potentially be used for intermittent screening or continuously for prolonged periods to detect paroxysmal AF. Further work could lead to cost-effective and accurate estimation of AF burden and improved risk stratification in AF.

AB  - Background
   Wrist-worn accelerometry provides objective monitoring of upper-extremity functional use, such as reaching tasks, but also detects nonfunctional movements, leading to ambiguity in monitoring results.
   Objective
   Compare machine learning algorithms with standard methods (counts ratio) to improve accuracy in detecting functional activity.
   Methods
   Healthy controls and individuals with stroke performed unstructured tasks in a simulated community environment (Test duration = 26 +/- 8 minutes) while accelerometry and video were synchronously recorded. Human annotators scored each frame of the video as being functional or nonfunctional activity, providing ground truth. Several machine learning algorithms were developed to separate functional from nonfunctional activity in the accelerometer data. We also calculated the counts ratio, which uses a thresholding scheme to calculate the duration of activity in the paretic limb normalized by the less-affected limb.
   Results
   The counts ratio was not significantly correlated with ground truth and had large errors (r = 0.48; P = .16; average error = 52.7%) because of high levels of nonfunctional movement in the paretic limb. Counts did not increase with increased functional movement. The best-performing intrasubject machine learning algorithm had an accuracy of 92.6% in the paretic limb of stroke patients, and the correlation with ground truth was r = 0.99 (P < .001; average error = 3.9%). The best intersubject model had an accuracy of 74.2% and a correlation of r =0.81 (P = .005; average error = 5.2%) with ground truth.
   Conclusions
   In our sample, the counts ratio did not accurately reflect functional activity. Machine learning algorithms were more accurate, and future work should focus on the development of a clinical tool.

AB  - The remarkable advancements in biotechnology and public healthcare infrastructures have led to a momentous production of critical and sensitive healthcare data. By applying intelligent data analysis techniques, many interesting patterns are identified for the early and onset detection and prevention of several fatal diseases. Diabetes mellitus is an extremely life-threatening disease because it contributes to other lethal diseases, i.e., heart, kidney, and nerve damage. In this paper, a machine learning based approach has been proposed for the classification, early-stage identification, and prediction of diabetes. Furthermore, it also presents an IoT-based hypothetical diabetes monitoring system for a healthy and affected person to monitor his blood glucose (BG) level. For diabetes classification, three different classifiers have been employed, i.e., random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and logistic regression (LR). For predictive analysis, we have employed long short-term memory (LSTM), moving averages (MA), and linear regression (LR). For experimental evaluation, a benchmark PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset is used. During the analysis, it is observed that MLP outperforms other classifiers with 86.08% of accuracy and LSTM improves the significant prediction with 87.26% accuracy of diabetes. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the proposed approach is also performed with existing state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating the adaptability of the proposed approach in many public healthcare applications.

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmia is a life-threatening disease which causes severe health problems in patients. A timely diagnosis of arrhythmia diseases will be useful to save the lives. Internet of Things (IoT) assures to modernize the health-care sector through continuous, remote and noninvasive monitoring of cardiac arrhythmia diseases. An IoT platform for prediction of cardiovascular disease using an IoT-enabled ECG telemetry system acquires the ECG signal, processes the ECG signal and alerts physician for an emergency. It is helpful for the physician to analyze the heart disease as early and accurate. We are developing an IoT-enabled ECG monitoring system to analyze the ECG signal. The statistical features of raw ECG signal are calculated. The ECG signal is analyzed using Pan Tompkins QRS detection algorithm for obtaining the dynamic features of the ECG signal. The system is used to find the RR intervals from ECG signal to capture heart rate variability features. The statistical and dynamic features are then applied to the classification process to classify the cardiac arrhythmia disease. People can check their cardiac condition by the acquisition of ECG signal even in their home. The size of the system is small, and it requires less maintenance and operational cost. It is helpful for the physician to analyze the heart disease as easily and accurately.

AB  - With an intention of improving healthcare performance, wearable technology products utilize several digital health sensors which are classically linked into sensor networks, including body-worn and ambient sensors. On the other hand, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) defines the injury of blood vessels in the brain regions, which is accountable for 10-15% of strokes. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans are commonly employed to determine the position and size of the hemorrhages. Manual segmentation of the CT scans by planimetry using a radiologist is effective; however, it consumes more time. Therefore, this paper develops deep learning (DL)-based ICH diagnosis using GrabCut-based segmentation with synergic deep learning (SDL), named GC-SDL model. The proposed method make use of Gabor filtering for noise removal, thereby the image quality can be raised. In addition, GrabCut-based segmentation technique is applied to identify the diseased portions effectively in the image. To perform the feature extraction process, SDL model is utilized and finally, softmax (SM) layer is employed as a classifier. In order to investigate the performance of the GC-SDL model, an extensive set of experimentation takes place using a benchmark ICH dataset, and the results are examined under different evaluation metrics. The experimental outcome stated that the GC-SDL model has reached a higher sensitivity of 94.01%, specificity of 97.78%, precision of 95.79%, and accuracy of 95.73%.

AB  - The latest developments in deep learning have made it possible to implement automated, advanced extraction of several things' features and classifications. Deep learning methods have also become more prominent in arrhythmia detection. This study conceptualized a classification method for ECG arrhythmia utilizing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with images based on spectrograms without undergoing ECG visual examination such as R-peak or P-peak identification. This paper's CNN model would immediately disregard the noise parameter when its ECG data is converted into a 2D image while extracting the appropriate characteristic map in the pooling layer and convolution. Google's Inception V3 model was used to retrain the final layer of CNN for datasets recognition. This study established and formulated a diagnostic support system that enables the acquisition, interpretation, and analysis of clinical data and ECG biosignals from patients to facilitate heart disease diagnosis in rural areas or places where there is no ECG facility. Two ways were developed in training and testing the ECG datasets, the binary, and quinary classifications. These two classifications made a remarkable accuracy of 98.73% for binary and 97.33% for quinary. This study obtained a higher accuracy rate compared to the previous works. Specificity, sensitivity. Positive predictive values and F1 scores also made desirable results from 96.83% to 99.21%. Hence, we concluded that our system is an effective method in classifying heart rhythms to help the cardiologists in diagnostic analysis in the patient.

AB  - Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heritable disease of heart muscle that increases the risk for heart failure, stroke, and sudden death, even in asymptomatic patients. With only 10-20% of affected people currently diagnosed, there is an unmet need for an effective screening tool outside of the clinical setting. Photoplethysmography uses a noninvasive optical sensor incorporated in commercial smart watches to detect blood volume changes at the skin surface. In this study, we obtained photoplethysmography recordings and echocardiograms from 19 HCM patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (oHCM) and a control cohort of 64 healthy volunteers. Automated analysis showed a significant difference in oHCM patients for 38/42 morphometric pulse wave features, including measures of systolic ejection time, rate of rise during systole, and respiratory variation. We developed a machine learning classifier that achieved a C-statistic for oHCM detection of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.99-1.0). With further development, this approach could provide a noninvasive and widely available screening tool for obstructive HCM.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) enabled various types of applications in the field of information technology, smart and connected health care is notably a crucial one is one of them. Our physical and mental health information can be used to bring about a positive transformation change in the health care landscape using networked sensors. It makes it possible for monitoring to come to the people who don't have ready access to effective health monitoring system. The captured data can then be analyzed using various machine learning algorithms and then shared through wireless connectivity with medical professionals who can make appropriate recommendations. These scenarios already exist, but we intend to enhance it by analyzing the past data for predicting future problems using prescriptive analytics. It will allow us to move from reactive to visionary approach by rapidly spotting trends and making recommendations on behalf of the actual medical service provider. In this paper, the authors have applied different machine learning techniques and considered public datasets of health care stored in the cloud to build a system, which allows for real time and remote health monitoring built on IoT infrastructure and associated with cloud computing. The system will be allowed to drive recommendations based on the historic and empirical data lying on the cloud. The authors have proposed a framework to uncover knowledge in a database, bringing light to disguise patterns which can help in credible decision making. This paper has evaluated prediction systems for diseases such as heart diseases, breast cancer, diabetes, spect_heart, thyroid, dermatology, liver disorders and surgical data using a number of input attributes related to that particular disease. Experimental results are conducted using a few machine learning algorithms considered in this paper like K-NN, Support Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and MLP.

AB  - Nowadays, the quick development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has changed our lifestyle. However, disease diagnosis is a difficult task owing to managing an enormous volume of data. Thus, in this research task, the latest IoT-assisted disease detection model for healthcare applications is developed. Initially, the patient data are taken from the IoT sensor devices in image, text, and signal data. The gathered patient data is further forward to the pre-processing phase. Accordingly, the images are gathered from patients' data using IoT devices and forward to the feature extraction process. Feature extraction is done based on the IoT-collected images using VGG16 and Inception network. Moreover, the signals are garnered from the patient's data and fed to the decomposition procedure. It is done by Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) technique. Then, the optimal feature selection of data, images, and signals is carried out by a hybrid algorithm termed Mating Probability-based Hybrid Strider Glowworm Swarm Optimization (MP-HSGSO). Finally, the Radial Basis Recurrent Neural Network (RBRNN) using MP-HSGSO is suggested to get the detected outcomes. Here, various brain diseases have been detected to classify the disease. This designed RBRNN method is utilized for efficient treatment, and also it provides the appropriate decision-making through processing various kinds of multimodal data. Throughout the simulation outcomes, the accuracy and precision of the offered method achieve 97 % and 96 %. Consequently, the simulation outcome of the offered method is proved that the designed model using a deep learning model shows enriched performance in clinical trial applications.

AB  - Circadian rhythms modulate physiological and behavioral processes of approximately 24-h periodicity. Alterations in the circadian timing system may lead to cardiovascular, metabolic or neurological diseases, cancers and sleep disorders, as well as to disruption of quality of life. Circadian rhythms can be tracked via laboratory tests measuring hormones in salivary, urinary or blood samples, which are collected in controlled environments. These tests are unsuitable for continuous monitoring in real-life, being expensive and time consuming, producing discrete information (i.e., few values per day) and requiring controlled environmental conditions (e.g., exposure to light can alter the samples). Thus, there is a need to develop non-invasive methods and tools to track circadian rhythms in real-life conditions.
   In this study, 10 healthy participants wore commercial medical-rated (i.e., CE-marked) wearable sensors, which continuously measured ECG, skin body temperature and physical activity for two consecutive days. Up to 10 salivary samples per day were taken and sent to a laboratory for measuring melatonin, which was used as proxy for circadian rhythm tracking.
   The results presented in this paper demonstrated that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures, physical activity and skin temperature changed significantly after the onset of melatonin. The deep-learning model presented in this study detected the onset of melatonin with 71 % accuracy, 67 % sensitivity, 75 % specificity and 77 % area under the curve (AUC).
   The current study concluded that deep learning could be used to track melatonin-onset in real-life, using physiological and behavioral measures monitored via wearable and easy-to-use sensors.

AB  - The evidence that heart rate variability (HRV) decreases during early Parkinson's disease (PD) largely depends on electrocardiogram data. In this study, we examined HRV in PD using wearable sensors and assessed various evaluation methods for detecting disease-related alterations. We evaluated 27 patients with PD and 23 disease controls. The wearable sensors POLAR V800 HR and POLAR H10 were used for the HRV measurements. The participants wore the two sensors for approximately 24 h, and long-term HRV data were acquired. We analyzed the standard deviation of normal R-R intervals (SDNN) and coefficient of variation of R-R intervals (CVRR) for every 100 consecutive beats. Focusing on the fluctuation of SDNN and CVRR, we extracted the minimum, first decile, first quartile, and median values of SDNN and CVRR. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each HRV parameter was calculated to differentiate PD from the disease controls. The minimum values of SDNN and CVRR had the highest AUC (SDNN: AUC 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.78-0.96; CVRR: AUC 0.90, CI 0.76-0.96) among the evaluation methods tested. The minimum values of SDNN and CVRR were significantly decreased in PD (SDNN: 9.5 +/- 4.0 ms vs. 4.4 +/- 2.0 ms, p < 0.0001; CVRR: 1.15 +/- 0.33% vs. 0.65 +/- 0.24%, p < 0.0001). We detected decreased HRV in PD using wearable sensors. Analyzing the minimum values of the HRV parameter in long-term recordings appears to be appropriate for detecting the decrease in HRV in PD.

AB  - Objectives: The introduction of time-dependent reperfusion therapies in acute ischemic stroke has increased the need for early identification. We explore the safety and feasibility of STROKE ALARM which detects sudden arm paresis, the most frequent symptom in stroke. Materials and methods: Consecutive patients admitted with a stroke or TIA at Skane University Hospital were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and included in the STROKE ALARM PRO 1 Study aiming to explore the feasibility of prolonged use (30 days) of the system in the community.STROKE ALARM consists of paired arm bracelets with accelerometers, coupled with a stroke test in a smartphone application. In case of an imbalance in arm movements, the user is prompted to perform an app-based stroke test. Failure to respond or to complete the stroke test correctly, triggers notification by SMS to predefined emergency contacts. Patients were followed up by telephone after completion.Results: Thirty patients were included and 28 completed follow-up. Median age was 68 years and 36.7% were female. No stroke events were recorded during follow-up. False indications occurred in all but one patient, and 22 (78.6%) experienced alarms to their emergency contacts. Despite a high level of false alarms, general user experience was rated in a positive or neutral manner by almost 90%. Very frequent alarms were probably due to mild arm paresis not detected in routine clinical assessment.Conclusions: Use of STROKE ALARM for 30 days after stroke/TIA was well tolerated warranting further study for early automated detection of stroke recurrence.

AB  - The use of wearable devices to study gait and postural control is a growing field on neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this paper, we investigate if machine-learning classifiers offer the discriminative power for the diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics. We compared Support VectorMachines (SVMs), Multiple Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) on 72 participants (36 AD patients and 36 healthy subjects) exposed to seven increasingly difficult postural tasks. The decisional space was composed of 18 kinematic variables (adjusted for age, education, height, and weight), with or without neuropsychological evaluation (Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score), top ranked in an error incremental analysis. Classification results were based on threefold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs sets: training (50%), test (40%), and validation (10%). Having a decisional space relying solely on postural kinematics, accuracy of AD diagnosis ranged from 71.7 to 86.1%. Adding the MoCA variable, the accuracy ranged between 91 and 96.6%. MLP classifier achieved top performance in both decisional spaces. Having comprehended the interdynamic interaction between postural stability and cognitive performance, our results endorse machine-learning models as a useful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of AD based on postural control kinematics.

AB  - Lung cancer, also known as pulmonary cancer, is one of the deadliest cancers, but yet curable if detected at the early stage. At present, the ambiguous features of the lung cancer nodule make the computer-aided automatic diagnosis a challenging task. To alleviate this, we present LungNet, a novel hybrid deep-convolutional neural network-based model, trained with CT scan and wearable sensor-based medical IoT (MIoT) data. LungNet consists of a unique 22-layers Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which combines latent features that are learned from CT scan images and MIoT data to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of the system. Operated from a centralized server, the network has been trained with a balanced dataset having 525,000 images that can classify lung cancer into five classes with high accuracy (96.81%) and low false positive rate (3.35%), outperforming similar CNN-based classifiers. Moreover, it classifies the stage-1 and stage-2 lung cancers into 1A, 1B, 2A and 2B sub-classes with 91.6% accuracy and false positive rate of 7.25%. High predictive capability accompanied with sub-stage classification renders LungNet as a promising prospect in developing CNN-based automatic lung cancer diagnosis systems.

AB  - Dehydration and overhydration can help to improve medical implications on health. Therefore, it is vital to track the hydration level (HL) specifically in children, the elderly and patients with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes. Most of the current approaches to estimate the hydration level are not sufficient and require more in-depth research. Therefore, in this paper, we used the non-invasive wearable sensor for collecting the skin conductance data and employed different machine learning algorithms based on feature engineering to predict the hydration level of the human body in different body postures. The comparative experimental results demonstrated that the random forest with an accuracy of 91.3% achieved better performance as compared to other machine learning algorithms to predict the hydration state of human body. This study paves a way for further investigation in non-invasive proactive skin hydration detection which can help in the diagnosis of serious health conditions.

AB  - Air pollution is a significant environmental issue affecting public health and ecosystems worldwide, resulting from various sources such as industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and fossil fuel burning. Air pollution contributes to climate change and can cause several health problems, such as respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. A potential solution to this problem has been proposed by using different artificial intelligence (AI) and time-series models. These models are implemented in the cloud environment to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI) utilizing Internet of things (IoT) devices. The recent influx of IoT-enabled time-series air pollution data poses challenges for traditional models. Various approaches have been explored to forecast AQI in the cloud environment using IoT devices. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of an IoT-Cloud-based model for forecasting the AQI under different meteorological conditions. To achieve this, we proposed a novel BO-HyTS approach that combines seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and long short-term memory (LSTM) and fine-tuned it by using Bayesian optimization to predict air pollution levels. The proposed BO-HyTS model can capture both linear and nonlinear characteristics of the time-series data, thus augmenting the accuracy of the forecasting process. Additionally, several AQI forecasting models, including classical time-series, machine learning, and deep learning, are employed to forecast air quality from time-series data. Five statistical evaluation metrics are incorporated to evaluate the effectiveness of models. While comparing the various algorithms among themselves becomes difficult, a non-parametric statistical significance test (Friedman test) is applied to assess the performance of the different machine learning, time-series, and deep learning models. The findings reveal that the proposed BO-HyTS model produced significantly better results than their competitor's, providing the most accurate and efficient forecasting model, with an MSE of 632.200, RMSE of 25.14, Med AE of 19.11, Max Error of 51.52, and MAE of 20.49. The results of this study provide insights into the future patterns of AQI in various Indian states and set a standard for these states as governments develop their healthcare policies accordingly. The proposed BO-HyTS model has the potential to inform policy decisions and enable governments and organizations to protect better and manage the environment beforehand.

AB  - Background: The idea of smart healthcare has gradually gained attention as a result of the information technology industry's rapid development. Smart healthcare uses next-generation technologies i.e., artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT), to intelligently transform current medical methods to make them more efficient, dependable and individualized. One of the most prominent uses of telemedicine and e-health in medical image analysis is teledermatology. Telecommunications technologies are used in this industry to send medical information to professionals. Teledermatology is a useful method for the identification of skin lesions, particularly in rural locations, because the skin is visually perceptible. One of the most recent tools for diagnosing skin cancer is dermoscopy. To classify skin malignancies, numerous computational approaches have been proposed in the literature. However, difficulties still exist i.e., lesions with low contrast, imbalanced datasets, high level of memory complexity, and the extraction of redundant features.Methods: In this work, a unified CAD model is proposed based on a deep learning framework for skin lesion segmentation and classification. In the proposed approach, the source dermoscopic images are initially pre-processed using a contrast enhancement based modified bio-inspired multiple exposure fusion approach. In the second stage, a custom 26-layered convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is designed to segment the skin lesion regions. In the third stage, four pre-trained CNN models (Xception, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and VGG16) are modified and trained using transfer learning on the segmented lesion images. In the fourth stage, the deep features vectors are extracted from all the CNN models and fused using the convolutional sparse image decomposition fusion approach. In the fifth stage, the univariate measurement and Poisson distribution feature selection approach is used for the best features selection for classification. Finally, the selected features are fed to the multi-class support vector machine (MC-SVM) for the final classification.Results: The proposed approach employed to the HAM10000, ISIC2018, ISIC2019, and PH2 datasets and achieved an accuracy of 98.57%, 98.62%, 93.47%, and 98.98% respectively which are better than previous works.Conclusion: When compared to renowned state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that the proposed skin lesion detection and classification approach achieved higher performance in terms of both visually and enhanced quantitative evaluation with enhanced accuracy.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a syndrome that occurs among women during pregnancy and is characterized by lack of insulin hormone secretion. GDM occurs in about 4% of all pregnancies and is diagnosed at later stages of pregnancy. It can occur in women with no known history of diabetes. Since no signs or symptoms occur at the onset of GDM, it is possible to diagnose it only through screening tests. GDM poses some major health risks such as hormonal imbalance, delivery risks, and the development of Type 2 diabetes ( T2D) after delivery. The condition can be diagnosed from the blood sugar level. Those diagnosed with GDM are likely to be obese, have a weak constitution, and be undergoing a stressful life or living in a stressful environment, eating unhealthy food, and living an unhealthy lifestyle. Other risk factors to be considered are family history, heredity, and the occurrence of diabetes in the past. Apart from diagnosis, the most crucial stage in managing GDM is its prognosis. If the disease is diagnosed at earlier stages, one can avoid its complications. Advanced technologies such as IoT and wearable sensors can help healthcare professionals in identifying the early signs and symptoms of GDM. In this scenario, data mining techniques are recommended for the prognosis of GDM using existing medical reports and risk factors related to women. A patient's medical history and their family history should be correlated with each other to find the likelihood of GDM occurrence. Classification is a technique in which a training dataset is used to predict the importance of related factors using an inference function. Our aim is to develop a prognosis model for GDM using a classification technique. A GDM prognosis model is developed using a training set of disease parameters along with an individual's risk factors. From the results of our experiments, it is inferred that the proposed model can be used for predicting the likelihood of GDM in its earlier stages.

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is the main cause of diabetic retinopathy, the most common cause of blindness worldwide. In order to slow down or prevent vision loss and degeneration, early detection and treatment are essential. For the purpose of detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy on fundus retina images, numerous artificial intelligence-based algorithms have been put forth by the scientific community. Due to its real-time relevance to everyone's lives, smart healthcare is attracting a lot of interest. With the convergence of IoT, this attention has increased. The leading cause of blindness among persons in their working years is diabetic eye disease. Millions of people live in the most populous Asian nations, including China and India, and the number of diabetics among them is on the rise. To provide medical screening and diagnosis for this rising population of diabetes patients, skilled clinicians faced significant challenges. Our objective is to use deep learning techniques to automatically detect blind spots in eyes and determine how serious they may be. We suggest an enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) utilizing a genetic algorithm in this paper. The ECNN technique's accuracy results are compared to those of existing approaches like the K-nearest neighbor approach, convolutional neural network, and support vector machine with the genetic algorithm.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely implemented in healthcare 4.0 for producing early and accurate results. The early predictions of disease help doctors to make early decisions to save the life of patients. Internet of things (IoT) is working as a catalyst to enhance the power of AI applications in healthcare. The patients' data are captured by IoT_sensor and analysis of the patient data is performed by machine learning techniques. The main aim of the work is to propose a Machine learning-based healthcare model to early and accurately predict the different diseases. In this work, seven machine learning classification algorithms such as decision tree, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, adaptive boosting, Random Forest (RF), artificial neural network, and K-nearest neighbor are used to predict the nine fatal diseases such as heart disease, diabetics breast cancer, hepatitis, liver disorder, dermatology, surgery data, thyroid, and spect heart. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, four performance metrics (such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve) are used. The RF classifier observes the maximum accuracy of 97.62%, the sensitivity of 99.67%, specificity of 97.81%, and AUC of 99.32% for different diseases. The developed healthcare model will help doctors to diagnose the disease early.

AB  - Purpose
   Detecting cancer from the computed tomography (CT)images of lung nodules is very challenging for radiologists. Early detection of cancer helps to provide better treatment in advance and to enhance the recovery rate. Although a lot of research is being carried out to process clinical images, it still requires improvement to attain high reliability and accuracy. The main purpose of this paper is to achieve high accuracy in detecting and classifying the lung cancer and assisting the radiologists to detect cancer by using CT images. The CT images are collected from health-care centres and remote places through Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled platform and the image processing is carried out in the cloud servers.
   Design/methodology/approach
   IoT-based lung cancer detection is proposed to access the lung CT images from any remote place and to provide high accuracy in image processing. Here, the exact separation of lung nodule is performed by Otsu thresholding segmentation with the help of optimal characteristics and cuckoo search algorithm. The important features of the lung nodules are extracted by local binary pattern. From the extracted features, support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained to recognize whether the lung nodule is malicious or non-malicious.
   Findings
   The proposed framework achieves 99.59% in accuracy, 99.31% in sensitivity and 71% in peak signal to noise ratio. The outcomes show that the proposed method has achieved high accuracy than other conventional methods in early detection of lung cancer.
   Practical implications
   The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested by using more than 500 images which are collected from public and private databases. The proposed research framework can be used to implement contextual diagnostic analysis.
   Originality/value
   The cancer nodules in CT images are precisely segmented by integrating the algorithms of cuckoo search and Otsu thresholding in order to classify malicious and non-malicious nodules.

AB  - Following the correct stroke order while writing Chinese characters composed of strokes plays an important role in handwriting efficiency and quality, especially for early education. Most existing systems use image processing techniques for character and stroke order recognition, which is sensitive to lighting conditions. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of SmartSO, which utilizes the inertial sensors of an off-the-shelf smartwatch for Chinese character and stroke order recognition. SmartSo first identifies the Chinese character written by the user, based on which SmartSo decides whether the stroke order is written correctly to help improve users' writing behavior. The biggest challenge for stroke order recognition is that some Chinese characters have repeated strokes (strokes of the same type), e.g., '(sic)' with two same horizontal strokes, and it is challenging to differentiate the writing order of such strokes given only the detected stroke composition (number and type of strokes). To mitigate this problem, we further analyze the hand movement between two adjacent strokes (referred to as direction motion) and propose a novel algorithm to recognize stroke order based on direction motion information. Finally, we build a fully functional prototype of SmartSO, and extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness and robustness.

AB  - Purpose Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals collected from wearable devices are easily corrupted with surrounding noise and artefacts, where the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of wearable ECG signals is significantly lower than that from hospital ECG machines. To meet the requirements for monitoring heart disease via wearable devices, eliminating useless or poor-quality ECG signals (e.g., lead-falls and low SNRs) can be solved by signal quality assessment algorithms. Methods To compensate for the deficiency of the existing ECG quality assessment system, a wearable ECG signal dataset from heart disease patients collected by Lenovo H3 devices was constructed. Then, this paper compares the performance of three machine learning algorithms, i.e., the traditional support vector machine (SVM), least-squares SVM (LS-SVM) and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithms. Different non-morphological signal quality indices (i.e., the approximate entropy (ApEn), sample entropy (SaEn), fuzzy measure entropy (FMEn), Hurst exponent (HE), kurtosis (K) and power spectral density (PSD) features) extracted from the original ECG signals are fed into the three algorithms as input. Results The true positive rate, true negative rate, sensitivity and accuracy are used to evaluate the performance of each method, and the LSTM algorithm achieves the best results on these metrics (97.14%, 86.8%, 97.46% and 95.47%, respectively). Conclusions Among the three algorithms, the LSTM-based quality assessment method is the most suitable for the signals collected by the Lenovo H3 devices. The results also show that the combination of statistical features can effectively evaluate the quality of ECG signals.

AB  - Dementia is a neurological and cognitive condition that affects millions of people around the world. At any given time in the United Kingdom, 1 in 4 hospital beds are occupied by a person with dementia, while about 22% of these hospital admissions are due to preventable causes. In this paper we discuss using Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and in-home sensory devices in combination with machine learning techniques to monitor health and well-being of people with dementia. This will allow us to provide more effective and preventative care and reduce preventable hospital admissions. One of the unique aspects of this work is combining environmental data with physiological data collected via low cost in-home sensory devices to extract actionable information regarding the health and well-being of people with dementia in their own home environment. We have worked with clinicians to design our machine learning algorithms where we focused on developing solutions for real-world settings. In our solutions, we avoid generating too many alerts/alarms to prevent increasing the monitoring and support workload. We have designed an algorithm to detect Urinary Tract Infections (UTI) which is one of the top five reasons of hospital admissions for people with dementia (around 9% of hospital admissions for people with dementia in the UK). To develop the UTI detection algorithm, we have used a Non-negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF) technique to extract latent factors from raw observation and use them for clustering and identifying the possible UTI cases. In addition, we have designed an algorithm for detecting changes in activity patterns to identify early symptoms of cognitive decline or health decline in order to provide personalised and preventative care services. For this purpose, we have used an Isolation Forest (iForest) technique to create a holistic view of the daily activity patterns. This paper describes the algorithms and discusses the evaluation of the work using a large set of real-world data collected from a trial with people with dementia and their caregivers.

AB  - Background: Consumer-grade wearable devices enable detailed recordings of heart rate and step counts in free-living conditions. Recent studies have shown that summary statistics from these wearable recordings have potential uses for longitudinal monitoring of health and disease states. However, the relationship between higher resolution physiological dynamics from wearables and known markers of health and disease remains largely uncharacterized.
   Objective: We aimed to derive high-resolution digital phenotypes from observational wearable recordings and to examine their associations with modifiable and inherent markers of cardiometabolic disease risk.
   Methods: We introduced a principled framework to extract interpretable high-resolution phenotypes from wearable data recorded in free-living conditions. The proposed framework standardizes the handling of data irregularities; encodes contextual information regarding the underlying physiological state at any given time; and generates a set of 66 minimally redundant features across active, sedentary, and sleep states. We applied our approach to a multimodal data set, from the SingHEART study (NCT02791152), which comprises heart rate and step count time series from wearables, clinical screening profiles, and whole genome sequences from 692 healthy volunteers. We used machine learning to model nonlinear relationships between the high-resolution phenotypes on the one hand and clinical or genomic risk markers for blood pressure, lipid, weight and sugar abnormalities on the other. For each risk type, we performed model comparisons based on Brier scores to assess the predictive value of high-resolution features over and beyond typical baselines. We also qualitatively characterized the wearable phenotypes for participants who had actualized clinical events.
   Results: We found that the high-resolution features have higher predictive value than typical baselines for clinical markers of cardiometabolic disease risk: the best models based on high-resolution features had 17.9% and 7.36% improvement in Brier score over baselines based on age and gender and resting heart rate, respectively (P<.001 in each case). Furthermore, heart rate dynamics from different activity states contain distinct information (maximum absolute correlation coefficient of 0.15). Heart rate dynamics in sedentary states are most predictive of lipid abnormalities and obesity, whereas patterns in active states are most predictive of blood pressure abnormalities (P<.001). Moreover, in comparison with standard measures, higher resolution patterns in wearable heart rate recordings are better able to represent subtle physiological dynamics related to genomic risk for cardiometabolic disease (improvement of 11.9%-22.0% in Brier scores; P<.001). Finally, illustrative case studies reveal connections between these high-resolution phenotypes and actualized clinical events, even for borderline profiles lacking apparent cardiometabolic risk markers.
   Conclusions: High-resolution digital phenotypes recorded by consumer wearables in free-living states have the potential to enhance the prediction of cardiometabolic disease risk and could enable more proactive and personalized health management.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation affects approximately 4% of the world's population and is one of the major causes of stroke, heart failure, sudden death, and cardiovascular morbidity. It can be difficult to diagnose when asymptomatic or in the paroxysmal stage, and its natural history is not well understood. New wearables and connected devices offer an opportunity to improve on this situation.
   Objective: We aimed to validate an algorithm for the automatic detection of atrial fibrillation from a single-lead electrocardiogram taken with a smartwatch.
   Methods: Eligible patients were recruited from 4 sites in Paris, France. Electrocardiograms (12-lead reference and single lead) were captured simultaneously. The electrocardiograms were reviewed by independent, blinded board-certified cardiologists. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm to detect atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm were calculated. The quality of single-lead electrocardiograms (visibility and polarity of waves, interval durations, heart rate) was assessed in comparison with the gold standard (12-lead electrocardiogram).
   Results: A total of 262 patients (atrial fibrillation: n=100, age: mean 74.3 years, SD 12.3; normal sinus rhythm: n=113, age: 61.8 years, SD 14.3; other arrhythmia: n=45, 66.9 years, SD 15.2; unreadable electrocardiograms: n=4) were included in the final analysis; 6.9% (18/262) were classified as Noise by the algorithm. Excluding other arrhythmias and Noise, the sensitivity for atrial fibrillation detection was 0.963 (95% CI lower bound 0.894), and the specificity was 1.000 (95% CI lower bound 0.967). Visibility and polarity accuracies were similar (1-lead electrocardiogram: P waves: 96.9%, QRS complexes: 99.2%, T waves: 91.2%; 12-lead electrocardiogram: P waves: 100%, QRS complexes: 98.8%, T waves: 99.5%). P-wave visibility accuracy was 99% (99/100) for patients with atrial fibrillation and 95.7% (155/162) for patients with normal sinus rhythm, other arrhythmias, and unreadable electrocardiograms. The absolute values of the mean differences in PR duration and QRS width were <3 ms, and more than 97% were <40 ms. The mean difference between the heart rates from the 1-lead electrocardiogram calculated by the algorithm and those calculated by cardiologists was 0.55 bpm.
   Conclusions: The algorithm demonstrated great diagnostic performance for atrial fibrillation detection. The smartwatch's single-lead electrocardiogram also demonstrated good quality for physician use in daily routine care.

AB  - Mental health-related disorders are common in elderly populations. Among the various mental health disorders, one most significant threat is dementia, and prediction of dementia has become an important issue related to well-being in old age, because the disease progression of dementia can be slowed by early diagnosis and disease control. In this paper, we propose an unobtrusive dementia-prediction system for monitoring physical activities of elderly persons either living alone or as a couple in different house structures, achieved through passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors combined with data processing. The proposed feature extraction algorithm extracts feature values related to physical activities from simple passive infrared sensors located in each room space. We then apply a variety of common popular classification models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), to predict the risk of dementia in a sensor-enabled home. We implemented and validated algorithms on data collected for over a month from 18 participants who were engaged with a variety of living conditions. The proposed system was effective in predicting dementia risk, with up to an 0.99 area under the curve (AUC) using DNN with principal component analysis (PCA) and a quantile transformer scaler. In terms of the result based on leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) analysis, an accuracy of 63.38% was achieved using DNN with PCA and a standard scaler. The proposed methodology is non-invasive and cost-effective, and can be used for a variety of long-term monitoring and early symptom detection systems, helping caregivers provide optimal interventions to elderly individuals at risk for dementia.

AB  - Wearable grip sensing shows potential for hand rehabilitation, but few studies have studied feasibility early after stroke. Here, we studied a wearable grip sensor integrated with a musical computer game (MusicGlove). Among the stroke patients admitted to a hospital without limiting complications, 13% had adequate hand function for system use. Eleven subjects used MusicGlove at home over three weeks with a goal of nine hours of use. On average they achieved 4.1 +/- 3.2 (SD) hours of use and completed 8627 +/- 7500 grips, an amount comparable to users in the chronic phase of stroke measured in a previous study. The rank-order usage data were well fit by distributions that arise in machine failure theory. Users operated the game at high success levels, achieving note-hitting success >75% for 84% of the 1061 songs played. They changed game parameters infrequently (31% of songs), but in a way that logically modulated challenge, consistent with the Challenge Point Hypothesis from motor learning. Thus, a therapy based on wearable grip sensing was feasible for home rehabilitation, but only for a fraction of subacute stroke subjects. Subjects made usage decisions consistent with theoretical models of machine failure and motor learning.

AB  - Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on "Biosignal Interpretation: Advanced Methods for Neural Signals and Images".
   Objectives: This paper presents the main concepts of a decision making approach for the remote management of COPD patients based on the early detection of disease exacerbation episodes.
   Methods: An e-diary card is defined to evaluate a number of physiological variables and clinical parameters acquired remotely by means of wearable and environmental sensors deployed in patients' long-stay settings. The automatic evaluation of the card results in a so-called Chronic Status Index (CSI) whose computation is tailored to patients' specific manifestation of the disease (i.e., patient's phenotype). The decision support method relies on a parameterized analysis of CSI variations so as to early detect worsening changes, identify exacerbation severity and track the patterns of recovery.
   Results: A preliminary study, carried out in real settings with 30 COPD patients monitored at home, has shown the validity and sensitivity of the method proposed, which was effectively able to timely and correctly identify patients' critical situation.
   Conclusion: The preliminary results showed that the proposed e-diary card, which presents several novel features with respect to other solutions presented in the literature, can be practically used to remotely monitor COPD patients.

AB  - The development of the technology creates the lot of changes in food processing which leads to alter human life style. Due to the change of their food habits and lack of attention to the dietary habits there is an increase in the prevalence of diseases such as obesity, heart attack, diabetics and so on. Hence it is important to monitor the food consumption which will help to avoid health issues associated with it. For this purpose, IoT medical tooth chip is placed in the teeth via filling or bonding process, which is one of the electrochemical sensors that collect information of the consumed food such as salt, sugar, fat etc. The gathered information can be analyzed to assess the quality of food intake. The collected information is processed by using the bacterial optimization along with adaptive deep learning neural network that examines the collected IoT information using self-learning process. The IoT device is embedded in teeth that reduce the difficulties during mastication. The excellence of IoT device based food quality level prediction system is analyzed using MATLAB implementation setup in which data were collected from 53 patients and 15 patients was used to construct the testing model to assess the efficiency of the food quality examined using IoT device up to 99.23% of accuracy process.

AB  - The real-time monitoring and tracking systems play a critical role in the healthcare field. Wearable medical devices with sensors, mobile applications, and health cloud have continuously generated an enormous amount of data, often called streaming big data. Due to the higher speed of the streaming data, it is difficult to ingest, process, and analyze such huge data in real-time to make real-time actions in case of emergencies. Using traditional methods that are inadequate and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a significant need for real-time big data stream processing to guarantee an effective and scalable solution. So, we proposed a new system for online prediction to predict health status using Spark streaming framework. The proposed system focuses on applying streaming machine learning models (i.e. streaming linear regression with SGD) on streaming health data events ingested to spark streaming through Kafka topics. The experimental results are done on the historical medical datasets (i.e. diabetes dataset, heart disease dataset, and breast cancer dataset) and generated dataset which is simulated to wearable medical sensors. The historical datasets have shown that the accuracy improvement ratio obtained using the diabetes disease dataset is the highest one with respect to the other two datasets with an accuracy of 81%. For generated datasets, the online prediction system has achieved accuracy with 98% at 5 seconds window size. Beyond this, the experimental results have proofed that the online prediction system can online learn and update the model according to the new data arrival and window size.

AB  - Objective: Controlling blood glucose in the euglycemic range is the main goal of developing the closed-loop insulin delivery system for type 1 diabetes patients. The closed-loop system delivers the amount of insulin dose determined by glucose predictions through the use of computational algorithms. A computationally efficient and accurate model that can capture the physiological nonlinear dynamics is critical for developing an efficient closed-loop system. Methods: Four data-driven models are compared, including different neural network architectures, a reservoir computing model, and a novel linear regression approach. Model predictions are evaluated over continuous 30 and 60 min time horizons using real-world data from wearable sensor measurements, a continuous glucose monitor, and self-reported events through mobile applications. The four data-driven models are trained on 12 data contributors for around 32 days, 8 days of data are used for validation, with an additional 10 days of data for out-of-sample testing. Model performance was evaluated by the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error. Results: A neural network model using an encoder-decoder architecture has the most stable performance and is able to recover missing dynamics in short time intervals. Regression models performed better at long-time prediction horizons (i.e., 60 min) and with lower computational costs. Significance: The performance of several distinct models was tested for individual-level data from a type 1 diabetes data set. These results may enable a feasible solution with low computational cost for the time-dependent adjustment of artificial pancreas for diabetes patients.

AB  - Heat stroke can be potentially damaging for people while exercising in hot environments. To prevent this dangerous situation, we designed a wearable heat-stroke- detection device (WHDD) with early notification ability. First, we used several physical sensors, such as galvanic skin response (GSR), heart beat, and body temperature, to acquire medical data from exercising people. In addition, we designed risk evaluation functional components that were based on fuzzy theory to detect the features of heat stroke for users. If a dangerous situation is detected, then the device will activate the alert function to remind the user to respond adequately to avoid heat stroke.

AB  - A steady rise has been observed in the percentage of elderly people who want and are still able to contribute to society. Therefore, early retirement or exit from the labour market, due to health-related issues, poses a significant problem. Nowadays, thanks to technological advances and various data from different populations, the risk factors investigation and health issues screening are moving towards automation. In the context of this work, a worker-centric, IoT enabled unobtrusive users health, well-being and functional ability monitoring framework, empowered with AI tools, is proposed. Diabetes is a high-prevalence chronic condition with harmful consequences for the quality of life and high mortality rate for people worldwide, in both developed and developing countries. Hence, its severe impact on humans' life, e.g., personal, social, working, can be considerably reduced if early detection is possible, but most research works in this field fail to provide a more personalized approach both in the modeling and prediction process. In this direction, our designed system concerns diabetes risk prediction in which specific components of the Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) process are applied, evaluated and incorporated. Specifically, dataset creation, features selection and classification, using different Supervised Machine Learning (ML) models are considered. The ensemble WeightedVotingLRRFs ML model is proposed to improve the prediction of diabetes, scoring an Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.884. Concerning the weighted voting, the optimal weights are estimated by their corresponding Sensitivity and AUC of the ML model based on a bi-objective genetic algorithm. Also, a comparative study is presented among the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score (FINDRISC) and Leicester risk score systems and several ML models, using inductive and transductive learning. The experiments were conducted using data extracted from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) database.

AB  - Nowadays, quality improvement and increased accessibility to patient data, at a reasonable cost, are highly challenging tasks in healthcare sector. Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing (CC) architectures are utilized in the development of smart healthcare systems. These entities can support real-time applications by exploiting massive volumes of data, produced by wearable sensor devices. The advent of evolutionary computation algorithms and Deep Learning (DL) models has gained significant attention in healthcare diagnosis, especially in decision making process. Skin cancer is the deadliest disease which affects people across the globe. Automatic skin lesion classification model has a highly important application due to its fine-grained variability in the presence of skin lesions. The current research article presents a new skin lesion diagnosis model i.e., Deep Learning with Evolutionary Algorithm based Image Segmentation (DL-EAIS) for IoT and cloud-based smart healthcare environments. Primarily, the dermoscopic images are captured using IoT devices, which are then transmitted to cloud servers for further diagnosis. Besides, Backtracking Search optimization Algorithm (BSA) with Entropy-Based Thresholding (EBT) i.e., BSA-EBT technique is applied in image segmentation. Followed by, Shallow Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) model is utilized as a feature extractor. In addition, Deep-Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (D-KELM) model is employed as a classification model to determine the class labels of dermoscopic images. An extensive set of simulations was conducted to validate the performance of the presented method using benchmark dataset. The experimental outcome infers that the proposed model demonstrated optimal performance over the compared techniques under diverse measures.

AB  - To extend the use of wearable sensor networks for stroke patients training and assessment in non-clinical settings, this paper proposes a novel remote quantitative Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) framework, in which two accelerometer and seven flex sensors were used to monitoring the movement function of upper limb, wrist and fingers. The extreme learning machine based ensemble regression model was established to map the sensor data to clinical FMA scores while the RRelief algorithm was applied to find the optimal features subset. Considering the FMA scale is time-consuming and complicated, seven training exercises were designed to replace the upper limb related 33 items in FMA scale. 24 stroke inpatients participated in the experiments in clinical settings and 5 of them were involved in the experiments in home settings after they left the hospital. Both the experimental results in clinical and home settings showed that the proposed quantitative FMA model can precisely predict the FMA scores based on wearable sensor data, the coefficient of determination can reach as high as 0.917. It also indicated that the proposed framework can provide a potential approach to the remote quantitative rehabilitation training and evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We tested the feasibility of automated discrimination of patients with panic disorder (PD) from healthy controls (HCs) based on multimodal physiological responses using machine learning. Electrocardiogram (ECG), electrodermal activity (EDA), respiration (RESP), and peripheral temperature (PT) of the participants were measured during three experimental phases: rest, stress, and recovery. Eleven physiological features were extracted from each phase and used as input data. Logistic regression (LoR), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) algorithms were implemented with nested cross-validation. Linear regression analysis showed that ECG and PT features obtained in the stress and recovery phases were significant predictors of PD. We achieved the highest accuracy (75.61%) with MLP using all 33 features. With the exception of MLP, applying the significant predictors led to a higher accuracy than using 24 ECG features. These results suggest that combining multimodal physiological signals measured during various states of autonomic arousal has the potential to differentiate patients with PD from HCs.

AB  - Objective. Arrhythmia is an abnormal cardiac rhythm that affects the pattern and rate of the heartbeat. Wearable devices with the functionality to measure and store heart rate (HR) data are growing in popularity and enable diagnosing and monitoring arrhythmia on a large scale. The typical sampling resolution of HR data available from non-medical grade wearable devices varies from seconds to several minutes depending on the device and its settings. However, the impact of sampling resolution on the performance and quality of arrhythmia detection has not yet been quantified. Approach. In this study, we investigated the detection and classification of three arrhythmias, namely atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, tachycardia, from down-sampled HR data with various temporal resolution (5-, 15-, 30- and 60 s averages) in 1 h segments extracted from an annotated Holter ECG database acquired at the University of Virginia Heart Station. For the classification task, a total of 15 common heart rate variability (HRV) features were engineered based on the HR time series of each patient. Three different types of machine learning classifiers were evaluated, namely logistic regression, support vector machine and random forest. Main results. A decrease in temporal resolution drastically impacted the detection of atrial fibrillation but did not substantially affect the detection of bradycardia and tachycardia. A HR resolution up to 15 s average demonstrated reasonable performance with a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.86 for a multiclass random forest classifier. Significance. HRV features extracted from low resolution long HR recordings have the potential to increase the early detection of arrhythmias in undiagnosed individuals.

AB  - The unprompted patient's and inimitable physician's experience shared on online health communities (OHCs) contain a wealth of unexploited knowledge. Med Help and eHealth are some of the online health communities offering new insights and solutions to all health issues. Diabetes mellitus (DM), thyroid disorders and tuberculosis (TB) are chronic diseases increasing rapidly every year. As part of the project described in this article comments related to the diseases from Med Help were collected. The comments contain the patient and doctor discussions in an unstructured format. The sematic vision of the internet of things (IoT) plays a vital role in organizing the collected data. We pre-processed the data using standard natural language processing techniques and extracted the essential features of the words using the chi-squared test. After preprocessing the documents, we clustered them using the K-means++ algorithm, which is a popular centroid-based unsupervised iterative machine learning algorithm. A generative probabilistic model (LDA) was used to identify the essential topic in each cluster. This type of framework will empower the patients and doctors to identify the similarity and dissimilarity about the various diseases and important keywords among the diseases in the form of symptoms, medical tests and habits.

AB  - Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may deteriorate rapidly and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary. We conducted an observational study involving patients with mild COVID-19 to explore the potentials of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based analysis of physiology parameters to detect clinical deterioration. Thirty-four patients (median age: 32 years; male: 52.9%) with mild COVID-19 from Queen Mary Hospital were recruited. The mean National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were 0.59 +/- 0.7. 1231 manual measurement of physiology parameters were performed during hospital stay (median 15 days). Physiology parameters obtained from wearable biosensors correlated well with manual measurement including pulse rate (r=0.96, p<0.0001) and oxygen saturation (r=0.87, p<0.0001). A machine learning-derived index reflecting overall health status, Biovitals Index (BI), was generated by autonomous analysis of physiology parameters, symptoms, and other medical data. Daily BI was linearly associated with respiratory tract viral load (p<0.0001) and NEWS2 (r=0.75, p<0.001). BI was superior to NEWS2 in predicting clinical worsening events (sensitivity 94.1% and specificity 88.9%) and prolonged hospitalization (sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 72.7%). Wearable biosensors coupled with machine learning-derived health index allowed automated detection of clinical deterioration.

AB  - The use of wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) for smart and affordable healthcare is trending. In traditional setups, the cloud backend receives the healthcare data and performs monitoring and prediction for diseases, diagnosis, and wellness prediction. Fog computing (FC) is a distributed computing paradigm that leverages low-power embedded processors in an intermediary node between the client layer and cloud layer. The diagnosis for wellness and fitness monitoring could be transferred to the fog layer from the cloud layer. Such a paradigm leads to a reduction in latency at an increased throughput. This paper processes a fog-based deep learning model, DeepFog that collects the data from individuals and predicts the wellness stats using a deep neural network model that can handle heterogeneous and multidimensional data. The three important abnormalities in wellness namely, (i) diabetes; (ii) hypertension attacks and (iii) stress type classification were chosen for experimental studies. We performed a detailed analysis of proposed models' accuracy on standard datasets. The results validated the efficacy of the proposed system and architecture for accurate monitoring of these critical wellness and fitness criteria. We used standard datasets and open source software tools for our experiments.

AB  - Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a widespread condition that is one of the main causes of health disasters around the world, and health monitoring is one of the sustainable development topics. Currently, the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies work together to provide a reliable method of monitoring and predicting Diabetes Mellitus. In this paper, we present the performance of a model for patient real-time data collection that employs the Hybrid Enhanced Adaptive Data Rate (HEADR) algorithm for the Long-Range (LoRa) protocol of the IoT. On the Contiki Cooja simulator, the LoRa protocol's performance is measured in terms of high dissemination and dynamic data transmission range allocation. Furthermore, by employing classification methods for the detection of diabetes severity levels on acquired data via the LoRa (HEADR) protocol, Machine Learning prediction takes place. For prediction, a variety of Machine Learning classifiers are employed, and the final results are compared with the already existing models where the Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers outperform the others in terms of precision, recall, F-measure, and receiver operating curve (ROC) in the Python programming language. We also discovered that using k-fold cross-validation on k-neighbors, Logistic regression (LR), and Gaussian Nave Bayes (GNB) classifiers boosted the accuracy.

AB  - A fog-based IoT model can be helpful for patients from remote areas with cardiovascular disease. An expert cardiologist is usually not available in such remote areas. There are some systems available to classify heart disease and provide recommendations but these existing systems only use classification for recommendations. From this line of research, we propose an IoT based efficient community-based recommender system that diagnoses cardiac disease and its type and provides recommendations related to the physical and dietary plan. The first part intent to collect the data from the patient remotely by using the bio sensors. The IoT based environment is used to transmit the data to the server. Afterward, heart disease prediction model is implemented, that can diagnose the cardiovascular disease and classify into eight available cardiovascular classes i.e. Myocardial Infarction (MI stable), Myocardial Infarction (MI unstable), Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), Atrial Fibrillation (AF), Hypertension (HTN), Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD), Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH), Chronic Heart Failure/ Left Ventricle Function (CCF/LVF), Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT). The second part pursues to provide physical and dietary plan recommendation to the cardiac patient according to gender and age groups. A dataset for diseases and corresponding recommendations is collected from a well-renowned hospital with the help of an expert cardiologist. The performance of the system is evaluated in terms of precision, recall and Mean absolute error and achieves 98% accuracy.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the pregnancy complications that endangers both mothers and babies. GDM is usually diagnosed at 22-26 weeks of gestation. However, early prediction is preferable because it may decrease the risk. The continuous monitoring of the mother's vital signs helps in predicting any deterioration during pregnancy. The originality of this research is to provide a comprehensive framework for pregnancy women monitoring. The proposed Data Replacement and Prediction Framework consists of three layers, which are: (i) Internet of things (IoT) Layer, (ii) Fog Layer, and (iii) Cloud Layer. The first layer used IoT sensors to aggregate vital signs from pregnancies using invasive and non-invasive sensors. The vital signs are then transmitted to fog nodes to be processed and finally stored in the cloud layer. The main contribution in this research is located in the fog layer producing the GDM module to implement two influential tasks which are as follows: (i) Data Finding Methodology (DFM), and (ii) Explainable Prediction Algorithm (EPM) using DNN. First, the DFM is used to replace the unused data to free up the cache space for new incoming data items. The cache replacement is very important in the case of the healthcare system as the incoming vital signs are frequent and must be replaced continuously. Second, the EPM is used to predict the occurrence of GDM in the second trimester of the pregnancy. To evaluate our model, we extracted data from 16,354 pregnant women from the medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC III) benchmark dataset. For each woman, vital signs, demographic data, and laboratory tests were aggregated. The results of the prediction model are superior to the state-of-the-art (ACC = 0.957, AUC = 0.942). Regarding explainability, we used Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) framework to provide local and global explanations for the developed models. Overall, the proposed framework is medically intuitive and allows the early prediction of GDM with a cost-effective solution.

AB  - Background: Cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions are effective in reducing prenatal stress, which can have severe adverse health effects on mothers and newborns if unaddressed. Predicting next-day physiological or perceived stress can help to inform and enable pre-emptive interventions for a likely physiologically and perceptibly stressful day. Machine learning models are useful tools that can be developed to predict next-day physiological and perceived stress by using data collected from the previous day. Such models can improve our understanding of the specific factors that predict physiological and perceived stress and allow researchers to develop systems that collect selected features for assessment in clinical trials to minimize the burden of data collection. Objective: The aim of this study was to build and evaluate a machine-learned model that predicts next-day physiological and perceived stress by using sensor-based, ecological momentary assessment (EMA)-based, and intervention-based features and to explain the prediction results. Methods: We enrolled pregnant women into a prospective proof-of-concept study and collected electrocardiography, EMA, and cognitive behavioral therapy intervention data over 12 weeks. We used the data to train and evaluate 6 machine learning models to predict next-day physiological and perceived stress. After selecting the best performing model, Shapley Additive Explanations were used to identify the feature importance and explainability of each feature. Results: A total of 16 pregnant women enrolled in the study. Overall, 4157.18 hours of data were collected, and participants answered 2838 EMAs. After applying feature selection, 8 and 10 features were found to positively predict next-day physiological and perceived stress, respectively. A random forest classifier performed the best in predicting next-day physiological stress (F1 score of 0.84) and next-day perceived stress (F1 score of 0.74) by using all features. Although any subset of sensor-based, EMA-based, or intervention-based features could reliably predict next-day physiological stress, EMA-based features were necessary to predict next-day perceived stress. The analysis of explainability metrics showed that the prolonged duration of physiological stress was highly predictive of next-day physiological stress and that physiological stress and perceived stress were temporally divergent. Conclusions: In this study, we were able to build interpretable machine learning models to predict next-day physiological and perceived stress, and we identified unique features that were highly predictive of next-day stress that can help to reduce the burden of data collection.

AB  - People living with dementia (PLwD) often exhibit behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as episodes of agitation and aggression. Agitated behavior in PLwD causes distress and increases the risk of injury to both patients and caregivers. In this paper, we present the use of a multi-modal wearable device that captures motion and physiological indicators to detect agitation in PLwD. We identify features extracted from sensor signals that are the most relevant for agitation detection. We hypothesize that combining multi-modal sensor data will be more effective to identify agitation in PLwD in comparison to a single sensor. The results of this unique pilot study are based on 17 participants' data collected during 600 days from PLwD admitted to a Specialized Dementia Unit. Our findings show the importance of using multi-modal sensor data and highlight the most significant features for agitation detection.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine markers of atrial dysfunction in patients with cryptogenic stroke to predict episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with high risk of embolization (HpAF). We classified patients included in the Crypto-AF study, Cryptogenic Stroke registry, to detect paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF) with wearable Holter, according to the longest episode of pAF in three groups: without pAF detection, episodes of pAF shorter than 5 h, and episodes of pAF longer than 5 h (HpAF). Atrial dysfunction surrogates were evaluated: EKG pattern, Holter record and echocardiography parameters (left atria volume (LAVI), and peak atrial longitudinal and contraction strain (PALS and PACS). The level of N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was determined. All patients were followed for 2 years to detect pAF and stroke recurrence. From 308 patients, 253 patients with high quality Holter analysis were selected. The distribution was No pAF 78.6% (n = 199), pAF < 5 h 7.9% (n = 20), and HpAF > 5 h 13.4% (n = 34). Age of the patients and combination of PALS and NT-proBNP independently predicted HpAF OR 1.07 (1.00; 1.15) and OR 3.05 (1.08; 8.60) respectively. The validity of PALS and NT-proBNP to detect patients at risk of HpAF was higher than the validity of age (AUC 0.82, sensitivity 78.95%, specificity 63%). Patients with PALS < 25% and NT-proBNP > 283 pg/ml had more detection of pAF during follow-up 35% vs. 5.1% OR 2.33 (1.05-5.13) (p < 0.001). Multimodal assessment of atrial dysfunction with PALS and NT-proBNP improved the prediction of pAF episodes with high embolic risk in patients with cryptogenic stroke.

AB  - BackgroundThe wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD), (LifeVest, ZOLL, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) is a medical device designed for the temporary detection and treatment of malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias. WCD telemonitoring features enable the evaluation of the physical activity (PhA) of the patients. We sought to assess with the WCD the PhA of patients with newly diagnosed heart failure.MethodsWe collected and analyzed the data of all patients treated with the WCD in our clinic. Patients with newly diagnosed ischemic, or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and severely reduced ejection fraction, who were treated with the WCD for at least 28 consecutive days and had a compliance of at least 18 h the day were included.ResultsSeventy-seven patients were eligible for analysis. Thirty-seven patients suffered from ischemic and 40 from non-ischemic heart disease. The average days the WCD was carried was 77.3 +/- 44.6 days and the mean wearing time was 22.8 +/- 2.1 h. The patients showed significantly increased PhA measured by daily steps between the first two and the last two weeks (Mean steps in the first 2 weeks: 4,952.6 +/- 3,052.7 vs. mean steps in the last 2 weeks: 6,119.6 +/- 3,776.2, p-value: < 0.001). In the end of the surveillance period an increase of the ejection fraction was observed (LVEF-before: 25.8 +/- 6.6% vs. LVEF-after: 37.5 +/- 10.6%, p < 0.001). Improvement of the EF did not correlate with the improvement of PhA.ConclusionThe WCD provides useful information regarding patient PhA and may be additionally utilized for early heart failure treatment adjustment.

AB  - Constructing statistical models using personal sensor data could allow for tracking health status over time, thereby enabling the possibility of early intervention. The goal of this study was to use machine learning algorithms to classify patient-reported outcomes (PROs) using activity tracker data in a cohort of patients with stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). A population of 182 patients with SIHD were monitored over a period of 12 weeks. Each subject received a Fitbit Charge 2 device to record daily activity data, and each subject completed eight Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems short form at the end of each week as a self-assessment of their health status. Two models were built to classify PRO scores using activity tracker data. The first model treated each week independently, whereas the second used a hidden Markov model (HMM) to take advantage of correlations between successive weeks. Retrospective analysis compared the classification accuracy of the two models and the importance of each feature. In the independent model, a random forest classifier achieved a mean area under curve (AUC) of 0.76 for classifying the physical function PRO. The HMM model achieved significantly better AUCs for all PROs (p < 0.05) other than Fatigue and Sleep Disturbance, with a highest mean AUC of 0.79 for the physical function-short form 10a. Our study demonstrates the ability of activity tracker data to classify health status over time. These results suggest that patient outcomes can be monitored in real time using activity trackers.

AB  - Human respiration is accompanied with abundant physiological and pathological information, such as the change in ammonia (NH3) content, which is related to chronic kidney disease (CKD); hence, monitoring the breathing behavior helps in health assessment and illness prediction. In this work, a wearable respiration sensor based on CeO2@polyaniline (CeO2@PANI) nanocomposites that underwent a hydrogen plasma treatment is developed. The results unambiguously show that the response of the corresponding nanocomposites is significantly enhanced from 165 to 670% to 100 ppm NH3 compared to the counterpart that did not undergo hydrogen plasma treatment and even reaches 24% to 50 ppb NH3, suggesting its fascinating capability of detecting the trace level of NH3 in human breathing. The superior response for NH3 is ascribed to the stable oxygen vacancies produced by the hydrogen plasma treatment. Furthermore, the clinical tests for patients with uremia suggest that the as-designed sensor has potential applications in clinical monitoring for CKD. Herein, this work offers a new strategy to obtain respiration sensors with high performance and provides a feasible approach for health evaluation and disease monitoring of patients with CKD.

AB  - Sleep plays a critical role in stroke recovery. However, there are limited practices to measure sleep for individuals with stroke, thus inhibiting our ability to identify and treat poor sleep quality. Wireless, body-worn sensors offer a solution for continuous sleep monitoring. In this study, we explored the feasibility of (1) collecting overnight biophysical data from patients with subacute stroke using a simple sensor system and (2) constructing machine-learned algorithms to detect sleep stages. Ten individuals with stroke in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital wore two wireless sensors during a single night of sleep. Polysomnography served as ground truth to classify different sleep stages. A population model, trained on data from multiple patients and tested on data from a separate patient, performed poorly for this limited sample. Personal models trained on data from one patient and tested on separate data from the same patient demonstrated markedly improved performance over population models and research-grade wearable devices to detect sleep/wake. Ultimately, the heterogeneity of biophysical signals after stroke may present a challenge in building generalizable population models. Personal models offer a provisional method to capture high-resolution sleep metrics from simple wearable sensors by leveraging a single night of polysomnography data.

AB  - Friedreichs ataxia (FA) is caused by a variant of the Frataxin (FXN) gene, leading to its downregulation and progressively impaired cardiac and neurological function. Current gold-standard clinical scales use simplistic behavioral assessments, which require 18- to 24-month-long trials to determine if therapies are beneficial. Here we captured full-body movement kinematics from patients with wearable sensors, enabling us to define digital behavioral features based on the data from nine FA patients (six females and three males) and nine age- and sex-matched controls, who performed the 8-m walk (8-MW) test and 9-hole peg test (9 HPT). We used machine learning to combine these features to longitudinally predict the clinical scores of the FA patients, and compared these with two standard clinical assessments, Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index (SCAFI) and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). The digital behavioral features enabled longitudinal predictions of personal SARA and SCAFI scores 9 months into the future and were 1.7 and 4 times more precise than longitudinal predictions using only SARA and SCAFI scores, respectively. Unlike the two clinical scales, the digital behavioral features accurately predicted FXN gene expression levels for each FA patient in a cross-sectional manner. Our work demonstrates how data-derived wearable biomarkers can track personal disease trajectories and indicates the potential of such biomarkers for substantially reducing the duration or size of clinical trials testing disease-modifying therapies and for enabling behavioral transcriptomics.

AB  - Recently, wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) has attracted a lot of attention as a useful index for measuring heat strokes even when core body temperature cannot be available for the prevention. However, because the WBGT is only valid in the vicinity of the WBGT meter, the actual ambient heat could be different even in the same room owing to ventilation, clothes, and body size, especially in hot specific occupational environments. To realize reliable heat stroke prevention in hot working places, we proposed a new personalized vital sign index, which is combined with several types of vital data, including the personalized heat strain temperature (pHST) index based on the temperature/humidity measurement to adjust the WBGT at the individual level. In this study, a wearable device was equipped with the proposed pHST meter, a heart rate monitor, and an accelerometer. Additionally, supervised machine learning based on the proposed personalized vital index was introduced to improve the prevention accuracy. Our developed system with the proposed vital sign index achieved a prevention accuracy of 85.2% in a hot occupational experiment in the summer season, where the true positive rate and true negative rate were 96.3% and 83.7%, respectively.

AB  - Large-scale population screening and in-home monitoring for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) has so far been mainly carried out by traditional healthcare methods and systems. Development of mobile health may provide an independent, future method to detect PD. Current PD detection algorithms will benefit from better generalizability with data collected in real-world situations. In this paper, we report the top-performing smartphone-based method in the recent DREAM Parkinson's Disease Digital Biomarker Challenge for digital diagnosis of PD. Utilizing real-world accelerometer records, this approach differentiated PD from control subjects with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.87 by 3D augmentation of accelerometer records, a significant improvement over other state-of-the-art methods. This study paves the way for future at-home screening of PD and other neurodegenerative conditions affecting movement.

AB  - We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of 90-day cardiac monitoring with an external Holter device and to find a target population able to benefit from such a technique. Cryptogenic stroke patients were continuously monitored for 90 days with a textile wearable Holter (TWH). Compliance and quality of the monitoring were assessed by the number of hours of ECG stored per month. Mean predictors of pAF, including age, gender, stroke severity, and atrial size (LAVI), were evaluated. One-year follow-up assessed pAF detection outside per protocol monitoring. Out of 224 patients included in 5 stroke centers, 163 patients (72.76%) fulfilled the criteria for the protocol. Median monitoring time was similar among the three months. Per protocol pAF detection reached 35.37% at 90 days. The age (OR 1.095; 95% CI 1.03-1.14) and the LAVI (OR 1.055; 95% CI 1.01-1.09) independently predicted pAF. The cut-off point of 70 years (AUC 0.68) (95% CI 0.60-0.76) predicted pAF with a sensitivity of 75.8% and specificity of 50.5%. The LAVI cut-off point of 28.5 (AUC 0.67) (95% CI 0.56-0.77) had a sensitivity of 63.6% and a specificity of 61.8% to detect pAF. The combination of both markers enhanced the validity of pAF detection sensitivity to 89.6%, with a specificity of 27.59%. These patients had increased risk of pAF during the 90-day monitoring HR 3.23 (chi(2) 7.15) and beyond 90 days (chi(2) 5.37). Intensive 90-days TWH monitoring detected a high percentage of pAF. However, a significant number of patients did not complete the monitoring. Patients older than 70 years and with enlarged left atria benefitted more from the protocol.

AB  - Internet of Things-based smart healthcare systems have gained attention in recent years for improving healthcare services and reducing data management costs. However, there is a requirement for improving the smart healthcare system in terms of speed, accuracy, and cost. An intelligent and secure edge-computing framework with wearable devices and sensors is proposed for cardiac arrhythmia detection and acute stroke prediction. Latency reduction is highly essential in real-time continuous assessment, and classification accuracy has to be improved for acute stroke prediction. In this paper, preprocessing and deep learning-based assessment is performed in the edge-computing layer, and decisions are communicated instantly to the individuals. In this work, acute stroke prediction is performed by a deep learning model using heart rate variability features and physiological data. Classification accuracy is improved in this approach when compared to other machine learning approaches. Cloud servers are utilized for storing the healthcare data of individuals for further analysis. Analyzed data from these servers are shared with hospitals, healthcare centers, family members, and physicians. The proposed edge computing with wearable sensors approach outperforms existing smart healthcare-based approaches in terms of execution speed, latency time, and power consumption. The deep learning method combined with DWT performs better than other similar approaches in the assessment of cardiac arrhythmia and acute stroke prediction. The proposed classifier achieves a sensitivity of 99.4%, specificity of 99.1%, and accuracy of 99.3% when compared with other similar approaches.

AB  - Wearable devices have now become virtual assistants, and the sports industry also aims in technological integration. The objective of this research article is to introduce a wearable device to detect and record the movement of a cricket player during his training session. The designed system collects the displacement and rotational information through a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope placed on the cricket bat. We propose a data-driven machine learning model which takes raw analog data as input for classifying the strokes. The algorithm used is the polynomial support vector machine, a supervised classification algorithm with 300 independent variables to enable accurate and real-time stroke classification. The system has a dedicated user interface for accessing these real-time details. This wearable embedded system does not require any cloud services as the complex analyses are performed in the processor itself. The player and the coach can get visual reference support, and the mistakes can be corrected during the training period itself. The device can detect the arm action of a cricket player with a success rate of 97%. The hardware is powered using a 10,000 mAh rechargeable battery.

AB  - A system for classifying four basic table tennis strokes using wearable devices and deep learning networks is proposed in this study. The wearable device consisted of a six-axis sensor, Raspberry Pi 3, and a power bank. Multiple kernel sizes were used in convolutional neural network (CNN) to evaluate their performance for extracting features. Moreover, a multiscale CNN with two kernel sizes was used to perform feature fusion at different scales in a concatenated manner. The CNN achieved recognition of the four table tennis strokes. Experimental data were obtained from 20 research partic-ipants who wore sensors on the back of their hands while performing the four table tennis strokes in a laboratory environment. The data were collected to verify the performance of the proposed models for wearable devices. Finally, the sensor and multi-scale CNN designed in this study achieved accuracy and F1 scores of 99.58% and 99.16%, respectively, for the four strokes. The accuracy for five-fold cross validation was 99.87%. This result also shows that the multi-scale convolutional neural network has better robustness after five-fold cross validation.

AB  - Respiratory ailments such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia, and lung cancer are life-threatening. Respiration rate (RR) is a vital indicator of the wellness of a patient. Continuous monitoring of RR can provide early indication and thereby save lives. However, a real-time continuous RR monitoring facility is only available at the intensive care unit (ICU) due to the size and cost of the equipment. Recent researches have proposed Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and/ Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals for RR estimation however, the usage of ECG is limited due to the unavailability of it in wearable devices. Due to the advent of wearable smartwatches with built-in PPG sensors, it is now being considered for continuous monitoring of RR. This paper describes a novel approach for RR estimation using motion artifact correction and machine learning (ML) models with the PPG signal features. Feature selection algorithms were used to reduce computational complexity and the chance of overfitting. The best ML model and the best feature selection algorithm combination were fine-tuned to optimize its performance using hyperparameter optimization. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Fit a Gaussian process regression model (Fitrgp) feature selection algorithm outperformed all other combinations and exhibits a root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and two-standard deviation (2SD) of 2.63, 1.97, and 5.25 breaths per minute, respectively. Patients would be able to track RR at a lower cost and with less inconvenience if RR can be extracted efficiently and reliably from the PPG signal.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for intelligent mobile computing in healthcare has opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems. Combining AI techniques with the existing Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) will enhance the quality of care that patients receive at home remotely and the successful establishment of smart living environments. Building a real AI for mobile AI in an integrated smart hospital environment is a challenging problem due to the complexities of receiving IoT medical sensors data, data analysis, and deep learning algorithm complexity programming for mobile AI engine implementation AI-based cloud computing complexities, especially when we tackle real-time environments of AI technologies. In this paper, we propose a new mobile AI smart hospital platform architecture for stroke prediction and emergencies. In addition, this research is focused on developing and testing different modules of integrated AI software based on XAI architecture, this is for the mobile health app as an independent expert system or as connected with a simulated environment of an AI-cloud-based solution. The novelty is in the integrated architecture and results obtained in our previous works and this extended research on hybrid GMDH and LSTM deep learning models for the proposed artificial intelligence and IoMT engine for mobile health edge computing technology. Its main goal is to predict heart-stroke disease. Current research is still missing a mobile AI system for heart/brain stroke prediction during patient emergency cases. This research work implements AI algorithms for stroke prediction and diagnosis. The hybrid AI in connected health is based on a stacked CNN and group handling method (GMDH) predictive analytics model, enhanced with an LSTM deep learning module for biomedical signals prediction. The techniques developed depend on the dataset of electromyography (EMG) signals, which provides a significant source of information for the identification of normal and abnormal motions in a stroke scenario. The resulting artificial intelligence mHealth app is an innovation beyond the state of the art and the proposed techniques achieve high accuracy as stacked CNN reaches almost 98% for stroke diagnosis. The GMDH neural network proves to be a good technique for monitoring the EMG signal of the same patient case with an average accuracy of 98.60% to an average of 96.68% of the signal prediction. Moreover, extending the GMDH model and a hybrid LSTM with dense layers deep learning model has improved significantly the prediction results that reach an average of 99%.

AB  - A newly distributed fault-tolerant mHealth framework-based Internet of things (IoT) is proposed in this study to resolve the essential problems of healthcare service provision during the occurrence of frequent failures in a telemedicine architecture. Two models are presented to support the telehealth development of chronic heart disease (CHD) in a distant environment. In model-1, a new local multisensor fusion triage algorithm known as three-level localisation triage (3LLT) is proposed. In 3LLT, a group of heterogeneous sources is applied to triage patients as a clinical process, and the emergency levels inside/outside the home of a patient with CHD are determined. Failures related to sensor fusion can also be detected. In model-2, a centralised IoT connection towards distributed smart hospitals is employed by mHealth based on two attributes: (1) healthcare service packages and (2) time of arrival of a patient at a hospital. Three decision matrices have been used to overcome several issues on hospital selection based on multi-criteria decision-making by using an analytic hierarchy process. Two datasets are utilised: (1) a clinical CHD dataset, which includes 572 patients for testing model-1, and (2) a nonclinical dataset, which includes hospital healthcare service packages for testing model-2. Consequently, patients with CHD can be triaged into different emergency levels (risk, urgent and sick) with mHealth, and a final decision is made by selecting an appropriate hospital. Results are obtained through the clinical triage of patients, and different scenarios are provided for hospital selection. The verification of statistical results indicates that the proposed mHealth framework is systematically valid. The contribution of the mHealth framework is presented to provide an improved triage process, afford timely services and treatment for CVD patients and minimise the chances of error. These health sectors and policymakers can also recognise the evaluation benefits of smart hospitals by using the presented framework and move forward to fully automated mHealth applications.

AB  - Purpose This study has mainly aimed to compare and contrast two completely different image processing algorithms that are very adaptive for detecting prostate cancer using wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Cancer in these modern times is still considered as one of the most dreaded disease, which is continuously pestering the mankind over a past few decades. According to Indian Council of Medical Research, India alone registers about 11.5 lakh cancer related cases every year and closely up to 8 lakh people die with cancer related issues each year. Earlier the incidence of prostate cancer was commonly seen in men aged above 60 years, but a recent study has revealed that this type of cancer has been on rise even in men between the age groups of 35 and 60 years as well. These findings make it even more necessary to prioritize the research on diagnosing the prostate cancer at an early stage, so that the patients can be cured and can lead a normal life. Design/methodology/approach The research focuses on two types of feature extraction algorithms, namely, scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) that are commonly used in medical image processing, in an attempt to discover and improve the gap present in the potential detection of prostate cancer in medical IoT. Later the results obtained by these two strategies are classified separately using a machine learning based classification model called multi-class support vector machine (SVM). Owing to the advantage of better tissue discrimination and contrast resolution, magnetic resonance imaging images have been considered for this study. The classification results obtained for both the SIFT as well as GLCM methods are then compared to check, which feature extraction strategy provides the most accurate results for diagnosing the prostate cancer. Findings The potential of both the models has been evaluated in terms of three aspects, namely, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Each model's result was checked against diversified ranges of training and test data set. It was found that the SIFT-multiclass SVM model achieved a highest performance rate of 99.9451% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 99% specificity at 40:60 ratio of the training and testing data set. Originality/value The SIFT-multi SVM versus GLCM-multi SVM based comparison has been introduced for the first time to perceive the best model to be used for the accurate diagnosis of prostate cancer. The performance of the classification for each of the feature extraction strategies is enumerated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - Lung cancer is one of the major causes of cancer-related deaths due to its aggressive nature and delayed detections at advanced stages. Early detection of lung cancer is very important for the survival of an individual, and is a significant challenging problem. Generally, chest radiographs (X-ray) and computed tomography (CT) scans are used initially for the diagnosis of the malignant nodules; however, the possible existence of benign nodules leads to erroneous decisions. At early stages, the benign and the malignant nodules show very close resemblance to each other. In this paper, a novel deep learning-based model with multiple strategies is proposed for the precise diagnosis of the malignant nodules. Due to the recent achievements of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in image analysis, we have used two deep three-dimensional (3D) customized mixed link network (CMixNet) architectures for lung nodule detection and classification, respectively. Nodule detections were performed through faster R-CNN on efficiently-learned features from CMixNet and U-Net like encoder-decoder architecture. Classification of the nodules was performed through a gradient boosting machine (GBM) on the learned features from the designed 3D CMixNet structure. To reduce false positives and misdiagnosis results due to different types of errors, the final decision was performed in connection with physiological symptoms and clinical biomarkers. With the advent of the internet of things (IoT) and electro-medical technology, wireless body area networks (WBANs) provide continuous monitoring of patients, which helps in diagnosis of chronic diseases-especially metastatic cancers. The deep learning model for nodules' detection and classification, combined with clinical factors, helps in the reduction of misdiagnosis and false positive (FP) results in early-stage lung cancer diagnosis. The proposed system was evaluated on LIDC-IDRI datasets in the form of sensitivity (94%) and specificity (91%), and better results were obatined compared to the existing methods.

AB  - Detecting human motion and predicting human intentions by analyzing body signals are challenging but fundamental steps for the implementation of applications presenting human-robot interaction in different contexts, such as robotic rehabilitation in clinical environments, or collaborative robots in industrial fields. Machine learning techniques (MLT) can face the limit of small data amounts, typical of this kind of applications. This paper studies the illustrative case of the reaching movement in 10 healthy subjects and 21 post-stroke patients, comparing the performance of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF) in: (i) predicting the subject's intention of moving towards a specific direction among a set of possible choices, (ii) detecting if the subject is moving according to a healthy or pathological pattern, and in the case of discriminating the damage location (left or right hemisphere). Data were captured with wearable electromagnetic sensors, and a sub-section of the acquired signals was required for the analyses. The possibility of detecting with which arm (left or right hand) the motion was performed, and the sensitivity of the MLT to variations in the length of the signal sub-section were also evaluated. LDA and RF prediction accuracies were compared: Accuracy improves when only healthy subjects or longer signals portions are considered up to 11% and at least 10%, respectively. RF reveals better estimation performance both as intention predictor (on average 59.91% versus the 62.19% of LDA), and health condition detector (over 90% in all the tests).

AB  - At present days, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud platforms become widely used in various healthcare applications. The enormous quantity of data produced by the IoT devices in the healthcare sector can be examined on the cloud platform instead of dependent on restricted storage and computation resources exist in the mobile gadgets. For offering effective medicinal services, in this article, an online medical decision support system (OMDSS) is introduced for chronic kidney disease (CKD) prediction. The presented model involves a set of stages namely data gathering, preprocessing, and classification of medical data for the prediction of CKD. For classification, logistic regression (LR) model is applied for classifying the data instances into CKD and non-CKD. In addition, for tuning the parameters of LR, Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm is applied. The performance of the introduced model is examined using a benchmark CKD dataset. The experimental outcome observed the superior characteristics of the presented model on the applied dataset.

AB  - Cancer has been found as a heterogeneous disease with various subtypes and aims to destroy the body's normal cells abruptly. As a result, it is essential to detect and prognosis the distinct type of cancer since they may help cancer survivors with treatment in the early stage. It must also divide cancer patients into high- and low-risk groups. While realizing efficient detection of cancer is frequently a time-taking and exhausting task with the high possibility of pathologist errors and previous studies employed data mining and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify cancer, these strategies rely on handcrafted feature extraction techniques that result in incorrect classification. On the contrary, deep learning (DL) is robust in feature extraction and has recently been widely used for classification and detection purposes. This research implemented a novel hybrid AlexNet-gated recurrent unit (AlexNet-GRU) model for the lymph node (LN) breast cancer detection and classification. We have used a well-known Kaggle (PCam) data set to classify LN cancer samples. This study is tested and compared among three models: convolutional neural network GRU (CNN-GRU), CNN long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and the proposed AlexNet-GRU. The experimental results indicated that the performance metrics accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity (99.50%, 98.10%, 98.90%, and 97.50) of the proposed model can reduce the pathologist errors that occur during the diagnosis process of incorrect classification and significantly better performance than CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM models. The proposed model is compared with other recent ML/DL algorithms to analyze the model's efficiency, which reveals that the proposed AlexNet-GRU model is computationally efficient. Also, the proposed model presents its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for LN breast cancer detection and classification.

AB  - Diabetes impacts the quality of life of millions of people around the globe. However, diabetes diagnosis is still an arduous process, given that this disease develops and gets treated outside the clinic. The emergence of wearable medical sensors (WMSs) and machine learning points to a potential way forward to address this challenge. WMSs enable a continuous, yet user-transparent, mechanism to collect and analyze physiological signals. However, disease diagnosis based on WMS data and its effective deployment on resource-constrained edge devices remain challenging due to inefficient feature extraction and vast computation cost. To address these problems, we propose a framework called DiabDeep that combines efficient neural networks (called DiabNNs) with off-the-shelf WMSs for pervasive diabetes diagnosis. DiabDeep bypasses the feature extraction stage and acts directly on WMS data. It enables both an (i) accurate inference on the server, e.g., a desktop, and (ii) efficient inference on an edge device, e.g., a smartphone, to obtain a balance between accuracy and efficiency based on varying resource budgets and design goals. On the resource-rich server, we stack sparsely connected layers to deliver high accuracy. On the resource-scarce edge device, we use a hidden-layer long short-term memory based recurrent layer to substantially cut down on computation and storage costs while incurring only a minor accuracy loss. At the core of our system lies a grow-and-prune training flow: it leverages gradient-based growth and magnitude-based pruning algorithms to enable DiabNNs to learn both weights and connections, while improving accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DiabDeep through a detailed analysis of data collected from 52 participants. For server (edge) side inference, we achieve a 96.3 percent (95.3 percent) accuracy in classifying diabetics against healthy individuals, and a 95.7 percent (94.6 percent) accuracy in distinguishing among type-1 diabetic, type-2 diabetic, and healthy individuals. Against conventional baselines, such as support vector machines with linear and radial basis function kernels, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and linear ridge classifiers, DiabNNs achieve higher accuracy, while reducing the model size (floating-point operations) by up to 454.5x (8.9x). Therefore, the system can be viewed as pervasive and efficient, yet very accurate.

AB  - Nowadays, one of the causes leading to death in all over the world is the occurrence of arterial and cardiovascular events, which results in heart failure and premature deaths occurring in the form of myocardial infarction, stroke, and fainting. Therefore, it is essential to inform people before disasters occurring to prevent and warn of abnormal conditions. In this paper, a deep learning approach was used to predict arterial events over the course of a few weeks/months prior to the event using a 5-min electrocardiogram (ECG) recording and extracting time-frequency features of ECG signals. Considering the possibility of learning long-term dependencies to identify and prevent these events as quickly as possible, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was used. A Deep Belief Network (DBN) was also used to represent and select more efficient and effective features of the recorded dataset. This approach is briefly called LSTM-DBN. Four publicly available datasets in the field of health care were used to evaluate the proposed approach. These data were collected from wearable heart rate monitoring sensors along with demographic features in the context of the Internet of Things. The prediction results of the proposed LSTM-DBN were compared with other deep learning approaches (simple RNN, GRU, CNN and Ensemble), and traditional classification approaches (MLP, SVM, Logistic Regression and Random Forest). In addition, DBN performance was compared with other methods of feature selection and representation such as PCA and AutoEncoder. Experimental results showed that the proposed LSTM-DBN (88.42% mean accuracy) had significantly better performance in comparison with all other deep learning approaches and traditional classifications.

AB  - Remote health monitoring can help prevent disease at the earlier stages. The Internet of Things (IoT) concepts have recently advanced, enabling omnipresent monitoring. Easily accessible biomarkers for neurodegenerative disorders, namely, Alzheimer's disease (AD) are needed urgently to assist the diagnoses at its early stages. Due to the severe situations, these systems demand high-quality qualities including availability and accuracy. Deep learning algorithms are promising in such health applications when a large amount of data is available. These solutions are ideal for a distributed blockchain-based IoT system. A good Internet connection is critical to the speed of these system responses. Due to their limited processing capabilities, smart gateway devices cannot implement deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we investigate the use of blockchain-based deep neural networks for higher speed and delivery of healthcare data in a healthcare management system. The study exhibits a real-time health monitoring for classification and assesses the response time and accuracy. The deep learning model classifies the brain diseases as benign or malignant. The study takes into account three different classes to predict the brain disease as benign or malignant that includes AD, mild cognitive impairment, and normal cognitive level. The study involves a series of processing where most of the data are utilized for training these classifiers and ensemble model with a metaclassifier classifying the resultant class. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model over that of the OASIS-3 dataset, which is a longitudinal neuroimaging, cognitive, clinical, and biomarker dataset for normal aging and AD, and it is further trained and tested on the UDS dataset from ADNI. The results show that the proposed method accurately (98%) responds to the query with high speed retrieval of classified results with an increased training accuracy of 0.539 and testing accuracy of 0.559.

AB  - IntroductionUsing wrist-wearable sensors to ecological transient assessment may provide a more valid assessment of physical activity, sedentary time, sleep and circadian rhythm than self-reported questionnaires, but has not been used widely to study the association with mild cognitive impairment and their characteristics. Methods31 normal cognitive ability participants and 68 MCI participants were monitored with tri-axial accelerometer and nocturnal photo volumetric pulse wave signals for 14 days. Two machine learning algorithms: gradient boosting decision tree and eXtreme gradient boosting were constructed using data on daytime physical activity, sedentary time and nighttime physiological functions, including heart rate, heart rate variability, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, combined with subjective scale features. The accuracy, precision, recall, F1 value, and AUC of the different models are compared, and the training and model effectiveness are validated by the subject-based leave-one-out method. ResultsThe low physical activity state was higher in the MCI group than in the cognitively normal group between 8:00 and 11:00 (P < 0.05), the daily rhythm trend of the high physical activity state was generally lower in the MCI group than in the cognitively normal group (P < 0.05). The peak rhythms in the sedentary state appeared at 12:00-15:00 and 20:00. The peak rhythms of rMSSD, HRV high frequency output power, and HRV low frequency output power in the 6h HRV parameters at night in the MCI group disappeared at 3:00 a.m., and the amplitude of fluctuations decreased; the amplitude of fluctuations of LHratio nocturnal rhythm increased and the phase was disturbed; the oxygen saturation was between 90 and 95% and less than 90% were increased in all time periods (P < 0.05). The F1 value of the two machine learning algorithms for MCI classification of multi-feature data combined with subjective scales were XGBoost (78.02) and GBDT (84.04). ConclusionBy collecting PSQI Scale data combined with circadian rhythm characteristics monitored by wrist-wearable sensors, we are able to construct XGBoost and GBDT machine learning models with good discrimination, thus providing an early warning solution for identifying family and community members with high risk of MCI.

AB  - Background Insomnia, eating disorders, heart problems and even strokes are just some of the illnesses that reveal the negative impact of stress overload on health and well-being. Early detection of stress is therefore of utmost importance. Whereas the gold-standard for detecting stress is by means of questionnaires, more recent work uses wearable sensors to find continuous and qualitative physical markers of stress. As some physiological stress responses, e.g. increased heart rate or sweating and chills, might also occur when doing sports, a more profound approach is needed for stress detection than purely considering physiological data. Methods In this paper, we analyse the added value of context information during stress detection from wearable data. We do so by comparing the performance of models trained purely on physiological data and models trained on physiological and context data. We consider the user's activity and hours of sleep as context information, where we compare the influence of user-given context versus machine learning derived context. Results Context-aware models reach higher accuracy and lower standard deviations in comparison to the baseline (physiological) models. We also observe higher accuracy and improved weighted F1 score when incorporating machine learning predicted, instead of user-given, activities as context information. Conclusions In this paper we show that considering context information when performing stress detection from wearables leads to better performance. We also show that it is possible to move away from human labeling and rely only on the wearables for both physiology and context.

AB  - Heart disease is ranked second in the top ten death causes in Taiwan in 2016, while the amount of heart disease fatalities is increasing by about 700 individuals each year. Therefore, it is urgent to improve heart disease diagnostic accuracy. This research combines profound neural networks and information from the ECG to create an ECG classifier for left ventricular hypertrophy. The classification system uses data preprocessing to impute missing values of ECG data, which can be collected from IoT equipment and monitor the body situation quickly, and transform these data for use by the deep neural network. Then, the data is input into a six-layers deep neural network designed for this study and is used to predict left ventricular hypertrophy. L2-regularization and dropout are used to avoid overfitting in each model iteration. The system has been named the electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy classifier (ELVHC). The experimental findings demonstrate that the forecast model's precision is 73%, the sensitivity is 66%, and the specificity is 78%, which is considerably greater than two clinical techniques.

AB  - Objective: Rehabilitation specialists have shown considerable interest for the development of models, based on clinical data, to predict the response to rehabilitation interventions in stroke and traumatic brain injury survivors. However, accurate predictions are difficult to obtain due to the variability in patients' response to rehabilitation interventions. This study aimed to investigate the use of wearable technology in combination with clinical data to predict and monitor the recovery process and assess the responsiveness to treatment on an individual basis. Methods: Gaussian Process Regression-based algorithms were developed to estimate rehabilitation outcomes (i.e., Functional Ability Scale scores) using either clinical or wearable sensor data or a combination of the two. Results: The algorithm based on clinical data predicted rehabilitation outcomes with a Pearson's correlation of 0.79 compared to actual clinical scores provided by clinicians but failed to model the variability in responsiveness to the intervention observed across individuals. In contrast, the algorithm based on wearable sensor data generated rehabilitation outcome estimates with a Pearson's correlation of 0.91 and modeled the individual responses to rehabilitation more accurately. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach to combine estimates derived from the clinical data and the sensor data using a constrained linear model. This approach resulted in a Pearson's correlation of 0.94 between estimated and clinician-provided scores. Conclusion: This algorithm could enable the design of patient-specific interventions based on predictions of rehabilitation outcomes relying on clinical and wearable sensor data. Significance: This is important in the context of developing precision rehabilitation interventions.

AB  - Communication between sensors spread everywhere in healthcare systems may cause some missing in the transferred features. Repairing the data problems of sensing devices by artificial intelligence technologies have facilitated the Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) and its emerging applications in Healthcare. MIoT has great potential to affect the patient's life. Data collected from smart wearable devices size dramatically increases with data collected from millions of patients who are suffering from diseases such as diabetes. However, sensors or human errors lead to missing some values of the data. The major challenge of this problem is how to predict this value to maintain the data analysis model performance within a good range. In this paper, a complete healthcare system for diabetics has been used, as well as two new algorithms are developed to handle the crucial problem of missed data from MIoT wearable sensors. The proposed work is based on the integration of Random Forest, mean, class' mean, interquartile range (IQR), and Deep Learning to produce a clean and complete dataset. Which can enhance any machine learning model performance. Moreover, the outliers repair technique is proposed based on dataset class detection, then repair it by Deep Learning (DL). The final model accuracy with the two steps of imputation and outliers repair is 97.41% and 99.71% Area Under Curve (AUC). The used healthcare system is a web-based diabetes classification application using flask to be used in hospitals and healthcare centers for the patient diagnosed with an effective fashion.

AB  - Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Cigarette smoke includes thousands of chemicals that are harmful and cause tobacco-related diseases. To date, the causality between human exposure to specific compounds and the harmful effects is unknown. A first step in closing the gap in knowledge has been measuring smoking topography, or how the smoker smokes the cigarette (puffs, puff volume, and duration). However, current gold-standard approaches to smoking topography involve expensive, bulky, and obtrusive sensor devices, creating unnatural smoking behavior and preventing their potential for real-time interventions in the wild. Although motion-based wearable sensors and their corresponding machine-learned models have shown promise in unobtrusively tracking smoking gestures, they are notorious for confounding smoking with other similar hand-to-mouth gestures such as eating and drinking. In this paper, we present SmokeMon, a chest-worn thermal-sensing wearable system that can capture spatial, temporal, and thermal information around the wearer and cigarette all day to unobtrusively and passively detect smoking events. We also developed a deep learning-based framework to extract puffs and smoking topography. We evaluate SmokeMon in both controlled and free-living experiments with a total of 19 participants, more than 110 hours of data, and 115 smoking sessions achieving an F1-score of 0.9 for puff detection in the laboratory and 0.8 in the wild. By providing SmokeMon as an open platform, we provide measurement of smoking topography in free-living settings to enable testing of smoking topography in the real world, with potential to facilitate timely smoking cessation interventions.

AB  - This study examined the reliability of a tennis stroke classification and assessment platform consisting of a single low-cost MEMS sensor in a wrist-worn wearable device, smartphone, and computer. The data that was collected was transmitted via Bluetooth and analyzed by machine learning algorithms. Twelve right-handed male elite tennis athletes participated in the study, and each athlete performed 150 strokes. The results from three machine learning algorithms regarding their recognition and classification of the real-time data stream were compared. Stroke recognition and classification went through pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM), including SVM without normalization, SVM with Min-Max, SVM with Z-score normalization, K-nearest neighbor (K-NN), and Naive Bayes (NB) machine learning algorithms. During the data training process, 10-fold cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting and suitable parameters were found within the SVM classifiers. The best classifier was achieved when C = 1 using the RBF kernel function. Different machine learning algorithms' classification of unique stroke types yielded highly reliable clusters within each stroke type with the highest test accuracy of 99% achieved by SVM with Min-Max normalization and 98.4% achieved using SVM with a Z-score normalization classifier.

AB  - Background and Objectives: To study the effects of a low-carbohydrate and high-fiber diet and education on patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Methods and Study Design: We randomly divided 44 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease into two groups: low-carbohydrate and high-fiber diet and education (intervention group), and education alone (control group). Liver and kidney function, fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance index, body composition, and controlled attenuation parameter were detected before and after the intervention. Results: After 2 months, the body fat, body weight, abdominal circumference, and visceral fat area, fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance index, and levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, uric acid, and insulin of the intervention group were significantly lower than before (p<0.05). In the female intervention group, the insulin resistance index and levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, triglyceride, fasting plasma glucose, and C-peptide were lower and the level of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher than in the female control group (p<0.05). In the male intervention group, the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase, triglyceride, and fasting plasma glucose were lower and the level of serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher compared with the male control group (p<0.05). Conclusions: A low-carbohydrate and high-fiber diet and education can effectively reduce the body weight and body fat of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and improve metabolic indicators such as liver enzymes, blood glucose, blood lipid, and uric acid. Our female patients showed significantly better improvement in the indicators than our male patients.

AB  - Background and Aims: The recent increase in wearable devices for diabetes care, and in particular the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), generates large data sets and associated cybersecurity challenges. In this study, we demonstrate that it is possible to identify CGM data at an individual level by using standard machine learning techniques.Methods: The publicly available REPLACE-BG data set (NCT02258373) containing 226 adult participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D) wearing CGM over 6 months was used. A support vector machine (SVM) binary classifier aiming to determine if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual participant was trained and tested for each of the subjects in the data set. To generate the feature vector used for classification, 12 standard glycemic metrics were selected and evaluated at different time periods of the day (24 h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Different window lengths of CGM data (3, 7, 15, and 30 days) were chosen to evaluate their impact on the classification performance. A recursive feature selection method was employed to select the minimum subset of features that did not significantly degrade performance.Results: A total of 40 features were generated as a result of evaluating the glycemic metrics over the selected time periods (24 h, day, night, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). A window length of 15 days was found to perform the best in terms of accuracy (86.8% +/- 12.8%) and F1 score (0.86 +/- 0.16). The corresponding sensitivity and specificity were 85.7% +/- 19.5% and 87.9% +/- 17.5%, respectively. Through recursive feature selection, a subset of 9 features was shown to perform similarly to the 40 features.Conclusion: It is possible to determine with a relatively high accuracy if a CGM data stream belongs to an individual. The proposed approach can be used as a digital CGM "fingerprint" or for detecting glycemic changes within an individual, for example during intercurrent illness.

AB  - Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems have recently emerged as a prominent technology for assisting paralyzed people. Recovery from paralysis in most patients using the existing BCI-based assistive devices is hindered due to the lack of training and proper supervision. The system's continuous usage results in mental fatigue, owing to a higher user concentration required to execute the mental commands. Moreover, the false-positive rate and lack of constant control of the BCI systems result in user frustration. In this paper, we propose a framework for BCI systems that utilize deep learning (DL) in a efficient manner to reduce mental fatigue and frustration. The proposed Deep learning Brain System (DBS) recognizes the patient's intention for upper limb movement by a DL model based on the features extracted during training. DBS correlates and maps the different electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns of healthy subjects with the identified pattern's upper limb movement. The stroke-affected muscles of the paralyzed are then activated using the obtained superior pattern. The implemented DBS consisting of four healthy subjects and a quadriplegic patient achieved 94% accuracy for various patient movement intentions. The results show that DBS is an excellent tool for providing rehabilitation, and it delivers sustained assistance, even in the absence of caregivers.

AB  - Obtaining a quick remote diagnosis of heart disease has proven problematic in recent days. To overcome such issues in e-Healthcare systems, Internet of Things (IoT) applications have been deployed using cloud computing (CC) approaches. There are still a number of disadvantages to using CC, including latency, bandwidth, energy usage, and security and privacy concerns. Fog computing (FC), a CC development, may be able to overcome these obstacles. DiaFog enabling remote users for real-time diagnosis of diabetic mellitus disease (DMD) has been proposed in this study, which is based on the combined ideas of IoT, cloud, and fog computing, as well as an ensemble deep learning (EDL) technique. The proposed system is trained with EDL approaches on the integrated dataset of two diabetes mellitus disease datasets (DMDDs), namely, Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) and Hospital Frankfurt Germany Diabetes Dataset (HFGDD), obtained from the UCI-ML and Kaggle repository, respectively, and the integrated dataset of these two. The suggested system has been used to demonstrate accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, latency, arbitration time, jitter, processing time, throughput, energy consumption, bandwidth utilization, network utilization, scalability, and more. In the remote instantaneous diagnosis of diabetic patients, the integration of IoT-fog-cloud is useful. The results of the trials show the value of employing FC principles and their applicability for speedy diabetic patient remote diagnosis.

AB  - BackgroundNovel smartwatch-based cuffless blood pressure (BP) measuring devices are coming to market and receive FDA and CE labels. These devices are often insufficiently validated for clinical use. This study aims to investigate a recently CE-cleared smartwatch using cuffless BP measurement in a population with normotensive and hypertensive individuals scheduled for 24-h BP measurement. MethodsPatients that were scheduled for 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were recruited and received an additional Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 smartwatch for simultaneous BP measurement on their opposite arm. After calibration, patients were asked to measure as much as possible in a 24-h period. Manual activation of the smartwatch is necessary to measure the BP. Accuracy was calculated using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and ROC curves. Bland-Altman method and Taffe methods were used for bias and precision assessment. BP variability was calculated using average real variability, standard deviation and coefficient of variation. ResultsForty patients were included. Bland-Altman and Taffe methods demonstrated a proportional bias, in which low systolic BPs are overestimated, and high BPs are underestimated. Diastolic BPs were all overestimated, with increasing bias toward lower BPs. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting systolic and/or diastolic hypertension were 83 and 41%, respectively. ROC curves demonstrate an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.78 for systolic hypertension and of 0.93 for diastolic hypertension. BP variability was systematically higher in the ABPM measurements compared to the smartwatch measurements. ConclusionThis study demonstrates that the BP measurements by the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 show a systematic bias toward a calibration point, overestimating low BPs and underestimating high BPs, when investigated in both normotensive and hypertensive patients. Standards for traditional non-invasive sphygmomanometers are not met, but these standards are not fully applicable to cuffless devices, emphasizing the urgent need for new standards for cuffless devices. The smartwatch-based BP measurement is not yet ready for clinical usage. Future studies are needed to further validate wearable devices, and also to demonstrate new possibilities of non-invasive, high-frequency BP monitoring.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 34 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of stroke. A readily accessible means to continuously monitor for AF could prevent large numbers of strokes and death.
   OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a deep neural network to detect AF using smartwatch data.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this multinational cardiovascular remote cohort study coordinated at the University of California, San Francisco, smartwatches were used to obtain heart rate and step count data for algorithm development. A total of 9750 participants enrolled in the Health eHeart Study and 51 patients undergoing cardioversion at the University of California, San Francisco, were enrolled between February 2016 and March 2017. A deep neural network was trained using a method called heuristic pretraining in which the network approximated representations of the R-R interval (ie, time between heartbeats) without manual labeling of training data. Validation was performed against the reference standard 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) in a separate cohort of patients undergoing cardioversion. A second exploratory validation was performed using smartwatch data from ambulatory individuals against the reference standard of self-reported history of persistent AF. Data were analyzed from March 2017 to September 2017.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic C statistic for the algorithm to detect AF were generated based on the reference standard of 12-lead ECG-diagnosed AF.
   RESULTS Of the 9750 participants enrolled in the remote cohort, including 347 participants with AF, 6143 (63.0%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 42 (12) years. There were more than 139 million heart rate measurements on which the deep neural network was trained. The deep neural network exhibited a C statistic of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.94-1.00; P < .001) to detect AF against the reference standard 12-lead ECG-diagnosed AF in the external validation cohort of 51 patients undergoing cardioversion; sensitivity was 98.0% and specificity was 90.2%. In an exploratory analysis relying on self-report of persistent AF in ambulatory participants, the C statistic was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.64-0.78); sensitivity was 67.7% and specificity was 67.6%.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This proof-of-concept study found that smartwatch photoplethysmography coupled with a deep neural network can passively detect AF but with some loss of sensitivity and specificity against a criterion-standard ECG. Further studies will help identify the optimal role for smartwatch-guided rhythm assessment.

AB  - This study aims to evaluate the effect of heart rate variability (HRV) indices on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of patients with congestive heart failure and to test the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms. Twenty-nine long-term RR interval recordings from subjects (aged 34 to 79) with congestive heart failure (NYHA classes I, II, and III) in MIT-BIH Database were studied. We firstly removed the unreasonable RR intervals and segment the RR recordings with a 300-RR interval length window. Then the multiple HRV indexes were calculated for each RR segment. Support vector machine (SVM) and classification and regression tree (CART) methods were then separately used to distinguish patients with different NYHA classes based on the selected HRV indices. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was finally employed as the evaluation indicator to compare the performance of the two classifiers. The SVM classifier achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 84.0%, 71.2%, and 83.4%, respectively, whereas the CART classifier achieved 81.4%, 66.5%, and 81.6%, respectively. The area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic for the two classifiers was 86.4% and 84.7%, respectively. It is possible for accurately classifying the NYHA functional classes I, II, and III when using the combination of HRV indices and machine learning algorithms. The SVM classifier performed better in classification than the CART classifier using the same HRV indices.

AB  - Introduction: Stroke is the leading cause of disability worldwide. It has been well-documented that rehabilitation (rehab) therapy can aid in regaining health and function for individuals with stroke. Yet, tracking in-home rehab continues to be a challenge because of a lack of resources and population-scale demands. In order to address this gap, we implemented a methodology to classify and track rehab interventions in individuals with stroke.
   Methods: We developed personalized classification algorithms, including neural network-based algorithms, to classify four rehab exercises performed by two individuals with stroke who were part of a week-long therapy camp in Jamaica, a low- and middle-income country. Accelerometry-based wearable sensors were placed on each upper and lower limb to collect movement data during therapy.
   Results: The classification accuracy for traditional and neural network-based algorithms utilizing feature data (e.g., number of peaks) from the sensors ranged from 64 to 94%, respectively. In addition, the study proposes a new method to assess change in bilateral mobility over the camp duration.
   Conclusion: The results of this pilot study indicate that personalized supervised learning algorithms can be used to classify and track rehab activities and functional outcomes in resource limited settings such as LMICs.

AB  - Recently, development of wearable and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies enables the real-time and continuous individual electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring. In this paper, we develop a novel IoT-based wearable 12-lead ECG SmartVest system for early detection of cardiovascular diseases, which consists of four typical IoT components: 1) sensing layer using textile dry ECG electrode; 2) network layer utilizing Bluetooth, WiFi, etc.; 3) cloud saving and calculation platform and server; and 4) application layer for signal analysis and decision making. We focus on addressing the challenge of real-time signal quality assessment (SQA) and lightweight QRS detection for wearable ECG application. First, a combination method of multiple signal quality indices and machine learning is proposed for classifying 10-s single-channel ECG segments as acceptable and unacceptable. Then a lightweight QRS detector is developed for accurate location of QRS complexes. The results show that the proposed SQA method can efficiently deal with tradeoff between accepting good (97.9%) and rejecting poor (96.4%) quality ECGs, ensuring that only a low percentage of recorded ECGs are discarded. The proposed lightweight QRS detector achieves a F-1 score higher than 99.5% for processing clean ECGs. Meanwhile, it reports significantly higher F-1 scores than two existing QRS detectors for processing noisy ECGs. In addition, it also has a fine computation efficiency. This paper demonstrates that the developed IoT-driven ECG SmartVest system can be applied for widely monitoring the population during daily life and has a promising application future.

AB  - Heart diseases represent a serious medical condition that can be fatal. Therefore, it is critical to investigate the measures of its early prevention. The Mel-scale frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) feature has been widely used in the early diagnosis of heart abnormity and achieved promising results. During feature extraction, the Mel-scale triangular overlapping filter set is applied, which makes the frequency response more in line with the human auditory property. However, the frequency of the heart sound signals has no specific relationship with the human auditory system, which may not be suitable for processing of heart sound signals. To overcome this issue and obtain a more objective feature that can better adapt to practical use, in this work, we propose an equal scale frequency cepstral coefficients (EFCC) feature based on replacing the Mel-scale filter set with a set of equally spaced triangular overlapping filters. We further designed classifiers combining convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN) and random forest (RF) layers, which can extract both the spatial and temporal information of the input features. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on our database and the PhysioNet Computational Cardiology (CinC) 2016 Challenge Database. Results from ten-fold cross-validation reveal that the EFCC-based features show considerably better performance and robustness than the MFCC-based features on the task of classifying heart sounds from novel patients. Our algorithm can be further used in wearable medical devices to monitor the heart status of patients in real time with high precision, which is of great clinical importance.

AB  - Diabetes has been recognized as a global medical problem for more than half a century. Patients with diabetes can benefit from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), intelligent pens, and similar devices. Smart devices generate continuous data streams that must be processed in real-time to benefit the users. The amount of medical data collected is vast and heterogeneous since it is gathered from various sources. An accurate diagnosis can be achieved through a variety of scientific and medical techniques. It is necessary to process this streaming data faster to obtain relevant and significant knowledge. Recently, the research has concentrated on improving the prediction model's performance by using ensemble-based and Deep Learning (DL) approaches. However, the performance of the DL model can degrade due to overfitting. This paper proposes the Extra-Tree Ensemble feature selection technique to reduce the input feature space with DL (ETEODL), a predictive framework to predict the likelihood of diabetes. In the proposed work, dropout layers follow the hidden layers of the DL model to prevent overfitting. This research utilized a dataset from the UCI Machine learning (ML) repository for an Early-stage prediction of diabetes. The proposed scheme results have been compared with state-of-the-art ML algorithms, and the comparison validates the effectiveness of the predictive framework. This proposed work, which outperforms the other selected classifiers, achieves a 97.38 per cent accuracy rate. F1-Score, precision, and recall percent are 96, 97.7, and 97.7, respectively. The comparison unveils the superiority of the suggested approach. Thus, the proposed method effectively improves the performance against the earlier ML techniques and recent DL approaches and avoids overfitting.

AB  - Hospital readmissions impose an extreme burden on both health systems and patients. Timely management of the postoperative complications that result in readmissions is necessary to mitigate the effects of these events. However, accurately predicting readmissions is very challenging, and current approaches demonstrated a limited ability to forecast which patients are likely to be readmitted. Our research addresses the challenge of daily readmission risk prediction after the hospital discharge via leveraging the abilities of mobile data streams collected from patients devices in a probabilistic deep learning framework. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset that includes smartphone and Fitbit device data from 49 patients collected for 60 days after discharge, we demonstrate our framework's ability to closely simulate the readmission risk trajectories for cancer patients.

AB  - We suggest a wearable soft robot for post-stroke, hemiplegic patients' finger rehabilitation and quantitative evaluations on the joint paralysis. The device consists of a pair of gloves. One measures finger positions of the normal side, and the other induces symmetric movements on the affected side by pneumatic force. Ten patients at Brunnstrom stage 3 and 4 from a local hospital participated in this study. They performed Rolyan Stacking Cones 10 times with and without the support of the soft robot. We measured subjects' proximal interphalangeal angles and air pressures in the pneumatic glove during the exercise to monitor grab/release patterns. The soft robot helped open their paralyzed finger joints by more than 50 degrees on average regardless of Brunnstrom stages. We applied pattern recognition methods on the measurement to quantitatively evaluate the subjects. A support vector machine revealed a misclassification rate of 20%, implying that there were a considerable number of overlapping data sets near the boundary between Brunnstrom stages. K-means method with three clusters suggested a new subject group near the support vector machine border. Thus, we conclude that our wearable soft robot not only provides grab/release guides to post-stroke patients but also provides quantitative information on their finger paralysis supplementary to the existing qualitative assessments.

AB  - IoT is an emerging technology that is rapidly gaining traction throughout the world. With the incredible power and capacity of IoT, anyone may connect to any network or service at any time, from anywhere. IoT-enabled gadgets have transformed the medical industry by granting unprecedented powers such as remote patient monitoring and self-monitoring. Accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is critical in the clinical ECG process since it is most often connected with a condition that might create serious difficulties in the body. Cardiologists and medical practitioners frequently utilize ECG to evaluate heart health. The human heart has an electric transmission system that creates regular electrical signals unintentionally and transmits them to the whole heart. Many individuals die as a result of heart disease all around the world. The doctor will be able to provide exceptional treatment to the patients, and the patients will be able to monitor their own health. This research offers an IoT-based ECG monitoring system that uses a heart rate sensor to create data and an intelligent hybrid classification algorithm to classify the data. ECG monitoring has become a widely used method for detecting cardiac problems. The following are the primary contributions of this paper: To begin, this paper introduces WISE (wearable IoT cloud-based health monitoring system), a unique system for real-time personal health monitoring. In order to offer real-time health monitoring, WISE uses the BASN (body area sensor network) infrastructure. Data from the BASN are instantly transferred to the cloud in WISE, and a lightweight wearable LCD may be incorporated to provide rapid access to real-time data. This hybrid model can manage with the problem of class imbalance in the ECG dataset, which will aid in the development of an IoT-based smart and accurate healthcare system. This research uses ADNN, which correctly predicts an abnormal ECG 98.1% of the time. The suggested hybrid model's results are compared to those of other classification models to determine its accuracy and suitability.

AB  - Gait monitoring with IOT has emerged as an important area of research because of the need of assessment of daily activities of patients and elder people. Ailments such as Parkin's stroke and the need of monitoring physically challenged persons in a crowd have been the driving force in the research of gait analysis. The evaluation of athletic performance is yet another area of application. Current measurement techniques rely on gait parameters, and the accuracy due to different gait-related occurrences is very restricted. Many sophisticated sensor-based gait patterns were established to keep the patient from falling and alerting in an emergency. The main objective of this research endeavour paper is to utilize phase transition based optimization in IOT environment for developing characteristic phases which maybe stable, unstable or Meta stable. The method proposed by IOT is used to detect early stage failure to monitor by data produced by signals interacted with wearable sensors. Moreover, optimisation is performed for forecasting and detecting fall more effectively in comparison with conventional gait analysis. In this phase transition based optimization fitness function of the subject is defined by degrees of order and disorder. Similar to genetic algorithm, the elements of individual nodes are considered based on initial population and size. The current generation evolves the next through operators along with terminal condition. For high fitness value, the stability is worse and based on fitness, the 3 phases are defined. For the experimentation, real time data of 50 participants having 20 elder persons and 20 physically challenged persons with other from stroke cases is processed on MATLAB 14.1. Sensors are placed at leg, hip and toe: the collected data are processed in the processing unit before classification. Following cuckoo search method with many iterations. False alarm rate probability and detection probability are plotted using the ROC and having a threshold between these on the histogram in dynamic range. It is observed that the proposed method has less false ratio and greater accuracy in comparison with KNN 88% and HMDTW models. Moreover, the average precision of 96.42% is achieved by this method; the maximum detection rate is 96% for given gait cycle. It is inferred that phase transition and adaptive cuckoo search method can be effectively combined so give better classification accuracy, detection sets and time of duration. Interpolated IOT adds to the effectiveness of the proposed system to the extent of accuracy of 98.44% and false ratio of 2.02%.

AB  - Alzheimer disease is a significant problem in public health. Alzheimer disease causes severe problems with thinking, memory and activities. Alzheimer disease affected more on the people who are in the age group of 80-year-90. The foot movement monitoring system is used to detect the early stage of Alzheimer disease. internets of things (IoT) devices are used in this paper to monitor the patients' foot movement in continuous manner. This paper uses dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to compare the various shapes of foot movements collected from the wearable IoT devices. The foot movements of the normal individuals and people who are affected by Alzheimer disease are compared with the help of middle level cross identification (MidCross) function. The identified cross levels are used to classify the gait signal for Alzheimer disease diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are calculated to evaluate the DTW algorithm based classification model for Alzheimer disease. The classification results generated using the DTW is compared with the various classification algorithms such as inertial navigation algorithm, K-nearest neighbor classifier and support vector machines. The experimental results proved the effectiveness of the DTW method.

AB  - Heart monitoring is important to deter any catastrophic because of heart failure that may happen. Continuous real-time heart monitoring could prevent sudden death due to heart attack. Nevertheless, the major challenge associated with continuous heart monitoring in the traditional approach is to undertake regular medical check-ups at the hospital or clinic. Hence, the aim of this study is to develop a mobile app where patients can real-time monitor their heart rate (HR) and detect abnormal HR whenever it occurs. Caregivers will be notified when a patient is detected with abnormal HR. The mobile app was developed for Android-based smartphones. A wearable HR sensor is used to collect RR data and transmitted to the smartphone via Bluetooth connection. User acceptance test was conducted to comprehend the intention and satisfaction level of the prospective users to use the application. The user acceptance test shows compatibility, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, trust, and behavioral intention to use had a high acceptance rate. It is expected that the developed app may provide a more plausible tool in monitoring HR personally, conveniently, and continuously at any time and anywhere.

AB  - With the increasing number of stroke patients, there is an urgent need for an accessible, scientific, and reliable evaluation method for stroke rehabilitation. Although many rehabilitation stage evaluation methods based on the wearable sensors and machine learning algorithm have been developed, the interpretable evaluation of the Brunnstrom recovery stage of the lower limb (BRS-L) is still lacking. The paper propose an interpretable BRS-L evaluation method based on wearable sensors. We collected lower limb motion data and plantar pressure data of 20 hemiplegic patients and 10 healthy individuals using seven Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and two plantar pressure insoles. Then we extracted gait features from the motion data and pressure data. By using feature selection based on feature importance, we improved the interpretability of the machine learning-based evaluation method. Several machine learning models are evaluated on the dataset, the results show that k-Nearest Neighbor has the best prediction performance and achieves 94.2% accuracy with an input of 18 features. Our method provides a feasible solution for precise rehabilitation and home-based rehabilitation of hemiplegic patients.

AB  - Heart Disease (HD) is one of the fatal diseases across the world and takes maximum number of lives if detected late. Therefore, early detection of HD has become essential, so that appropriate treatment can be taken up to save lives. In this paper, the problem of HD detection from heart sound signal by employing imbalanced number of training and testing sets has been undertaken and suitable Machine learning (ML) based detection models have been developed. In addition, various performance metrics have been evaluated and analyzed. A novel ensemble model has also been developed for improved detection of heart murmur. The raw Heart Sound (HS) signals after preprocessing, denoising and features extraction have been fed to the proposed models. Two different features: Discrete wavelet transform (DWT), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as well as combination of these two sets of features have been separately used as inputs during the development phase of the proposed models. To assess the consistency in performance of the developed detection models, two standard datasets have been used for training and validation tasks. The classification models used in the current study are Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB). These three machine learning based classifiers have been chosen because of their simplicity and already proven consistent performance in detection of other diseases. The best two performing models (RF and XGB) obtained from the simulation study have been identified and ensembled using Moth Flame Optimization (MFO) based weights selection scheme. Three different performance metrics such as (accuracy, F1-score and Area under the curve (AUC)) have been obtained through exhaustive simulation study and then analyzed. The results demonstrate that from amongst the combined features based three ML models, the RF detection scheme performs the best. This model provides an accuracy of 88.7%, F1 score of 0.89 and AUC of 0.95 for PhysioNet dataset and 86.16%, 0.86 and 0.89, respectively for Pascal CHSE dataset. But, the RF-MFO-XGB ensemble model achieves the best performance using the combined features as input. The performance measures in terms of accuracy, F1 score and AUC values of the ensemble models are 89.53%, 0.9 and 0.95, respectively. However, the corresponding metrics for Pascal CHSE dataset are found to be 87.89%, 0.87 and 0.93, respectively. Thus, the proposed ensemble provides consistent and improved performance. Hence, this model can be applied for detection of other diseases. In addition, the suggested model can be implemented under internet of things (IoT) environment and can be used at remote places.

AB  - The detection of significant moments can support the care of individuals with dementia by making visible what is most meaningful to them and maintaining a sense of interpersonal connection. We present a novel intelligent assistive technology (IAT) for the detection of significant moments based on patterns of physiological signal changes in individuals with dementia and their caregivers. The parameters of the IAT are tailored to each individual's idiosyncratic physiological response patterns through an iterative process of incorporating subjective feedback on videos extracted from candidate significant moments identified through the IAT algorithm. The IAT was tested on three dyads (individual with dementia and their primary caregiver) during an eight-week movement program. Upon completion of the program, the IAT identified distinct, personal characteristics of physiological responsiveness in each participant. Tailored algorithms could detect moments of significance experienced by either member of the dyad with an agreement with subjective reports of 70%. These moments were constituted by both physical and emotional significances (e.g., experiences of pain or anxiety) and interpersonal significance (e.g., moments of heighted connection). We provide a freely available MATLAB toolbox with the IAT software in hopes that the assistive technology community can benefit from and contribute to these tools for understanding the subjective experiences of individuals with dementia.

AB  - The human body is designed to experience stress and react to it, and experiencing challenges causes our body to produce physical and mental responses and also helps our body to adjust to new situations. However, stress becomes a problem when it continues to remain without a period of relaxation or relief. When a person has long-term stress, continued activation of the stress response causes wear and tear on the body. Chronic stress results in cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, and diabetes, and thus is deeply detrimental to our health. Previous researchers have performed a lot of work regarding mental stress, using mainly machine-learning-based approaches. However, most of the methods have used raw, unprocessed data, which cause more errors and thereby affect the overall model performance. Moreover, corrupt data values are very common, especially for wearable sensor datasets, which may also lead to poor performance in this regard. This paper introduces a deep-learning-based method for mental stress detection by encoding time series raw data into Gramian Angular Field images, which results in promising accuracy while detecting the stress levels of an individual. The experiment has been conducted on two standard benchmark datasets, namely WESAD (wearable stress and affect detection) and SWELL. During the studies, testing accuracies of 94.8% and 99.39% are achieved for the WESAD and SWELL datasets, respectively. For the WESAD dataset, chest data are taken for the experiment, including the data of sensor modalities such as three-axis acceleration (ACC), electrocardiogram (ECG), body temperature (TEMP), respiration (RESP), etc.

AB  - Purpose Heart arrhythmias result from any disturbance in the rate, regularity, and site of origin or conduction of the cardiac electric pulse. Sporadic and underappreciated characteristics make diagnosis less timely, leading to stroke, heart failure, or even sudden death. Wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) devices are gradually becoming the main trend of intelligent diagnosis alongside the improvement of information transmission and computation power of the hardware. Therefore, a database for arrhythmia detection was planned to construct. Methods Collaborating with hospital, this study presents a bipolar limb two-lead wearable device by collecting a large amount of real-time data and giving rise to readily available ECG databases. Results In total, the database contains 2000 30-s recordings of sinus, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias collected from more than 200 voluntary patients who had been diagnosed with heart diseases, ranging in age from 18 to 82. Meanwhile, manual annotations by cardiologists were proposed to benefit and instruct non-medical researchers to design the algorithm reasonably.

AB  - Early detection is critical to control Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and postpone cognitive decline. Traditional medical procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging are costly, involve long waiting lists, and require complex analysis. Alternatively, for the past years, researchers have successfully evaluated AD detection approaches based on machine learning and electroencephalography (EEG). Nonetheless, these approaches frequently rely upon manual processing or involve non-portable EEG hardware. These aspects are suboptimal regarding automated diagnosis, since they require additional personnel and hinder portability. In this work, we report the preliminary evaluation of a self-driven AD multi-class discrimination approach based on a commercial EEG acquisition system using sixteen channels. For this purpose, we recorded the EEG of three groups of participants: mild AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) non-AD, and controls, and we implemented a self-driven analysis pipeline to discriminate the three groups. First, we applied automated artifact rejection algorithms to the EEG recordings. Then, we extracted power, entropy, and complexity features from the preprocessed epochs. Finally, we evaluated a multi-class classification problem using a multi-layer perceptron through leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The preliminary results that we obtained are comparable to the best in literature (0.88 F1-score), what suggests that AD can potentially be detected through a self-driven approach based on commercial EEG and machine learning. We believe this work and further research could contribute to opening the door for the detection of AD in a single consultation session, therefore reducing the costs associated to AD screening and potentially advancing medical treatment.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss hybrid decision support to monitor atrial fibrillation for stroke prevention. Hybrid decision support takes the form of human experts and machine algorithms working cooperatively on a diagnosis. The link to stroke prevention comes from the fact that patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) have a fivefold increased stroke risk. Early diagnosis, which leads to adequate AF treatment, can decrease the stroke risk by 66% and thereby prevent stroke. The monitoring service is based on Heart Rate (HR) measurements. The resulting signals are communicated and stored with Internet of Things (IoT) technology. A Deep Learning (DL) algorithm automatically estimates the AF probability. Based on this technology, we can offer four distinct services to healthcare providers: (1) universal access to patient data; (2) automated AF detection and alarm; (3) physician support; and (4) feedback channels. These four services create an environment where physicians can work symbiotically with machine algorithms to establish and communicate a high quality AF diagnosis.

AB  - Serious clinical complications (SCC; CTCAE grade >= 3) occur frequently in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC +/- SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 +/- 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 +/- 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at -24 h and 0.88 at -48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management.

AB  - IoT in healthcare systems is currently a viable option for providing higher-quality medical care for contemporary e-healthcare. Using an Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart healthcare system, a trustworthy breast cancer classification method called Feedback Artificial Crow Search (FACS)-based Shepherd Convolutional Neural Network (ShCNN) is developed in this research. To choose the best routes, the secure routing operation is first carried out using the recommended FACS while taking fitness measures such as distance, energy, link quality, and latency into account. Then, by merging the Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) and Feedback Artificial Tree, the produced FACS is put into practice (FAT). After the completion of routing phase, the breast cancer categorization process is started at the base station. The feature extraction step is then introduced to the pre-processed input mammography image. As a result, it is possible to successfully get features including area, mean, variance, energy, contrast, correlation, skewness, homogeneity, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and Local Gabor Binary Pattern (LGBP). The quality of the image is next enhanced through data augmentation, and finally, the developed FACS algorithm's ShCNN is used to classify breast cancer. The performance of FACS-based ShCNN is examined using six metrics, including energy, delay, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and True Positive Rate (TPR), with the maximum energy of 0.562 J, the least delay of 0.452 s, the highest accuracy of 91.56%, the higher sensitivity of 96.10%, the highest specificity of 91.80%, and the maximum TPR of 99.45%.

AB  - BackgroundWearable sensor technology can facilitate diagnostics and monitoring of people with upper extremity (UE) paresis after stroke. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perspectives of clinicians, people living with stroke, and their caregivers on an interactive wearable system that detects UE movements and provides feedback.MethodsThis qualitative study used semi-structured interviews relating to the perspectives of a future interactive wearable system including a wearable sensor to capture UE movement and a user interface to provide feedback as the means of data collection. Ten rehabilitation therapists, 9 people with stroke, and 2 caregivers participated in this study.ResultsFour themes were identified (1) "Everyone is different" highlighted the need for addressing individual user's rehabilitation goal and personal preference; (2) "The wearable system should identify UE and trunk movements" emphasized that in addition to arm, hand, and finger movements, detecting compensatory trunk movements during UE movements is also of interest; (3) "Both quality and amount of movements are necessary to measure" described the parameters related to how well and how much the user is using their affected UE that participants envisioned the system to monitor; (4) "Functional activities should be practiced by the users" outlined UE movements and activities that are of priority in designing the system.ConclusionsNarratives from clinicians, people with stroke, and their caregivers offer insight into the design of interactive wearable systems. Future studies examining the experience and acceptability of existing wearable systems from end-users are warranted to guide the adoption of this technology.

AB  - The wide use of internet-enabled devices has not left the healthcare sector untouched. The health status of each individual is being monitored irrespective of his/her medical conditions. The advent of such medical devices is beneficial not only for patients but also for physicians, hospitals, and insurance companies. It makes healthcare fast, reliable, and hassle-free. People can keep an eye on their blood pressure, pulse rate, etc., and thus take preventive measures on their own. In hospitals, too, the Internet of Things (IoT) is being deployed for various tasks such as monitoring oxygen and blood sugar levels, electrocardiograms (ECGs), etc. The IoT in healthcare also reduces the cost of various ailments through fast and rigorous data analysis. The prediction of diseases through machine-learning techniques based on symptoms has become a promising concept. There may also be a situation where real-time analysis is required. In such a latency-sensitive situation, fog computing plays a vital role. Establishing communication every time with the cloud is not required with the introduction of fog and thus the latency is reduced. Healthcare is a latency-sensitive application area. So, the deployment of fog computing in this area is of vital importance. Our work focuses on improving the efficiency of the system for the precise diagnosis of and recommendations for heart disease. It evaluates the system using a machine-learning module.

AB  - This study analysed the accuracy of a prototype algorithm for tennis stroke detection from wearable technology. Strokes from junior-elite tennis players over 10 matches were analysed. Players wore a GPS unit containing an accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. Manufacturer-developed algorithms determined stoke type and count (forehands, backhands, serves and other). Matches were video recorded to manually code ball contacts and shadow swing events for forehands, backhands and serves and further by stroke classifications (i.e., drive, volley, slice, end-range). Comparisons between algorithm and coding were analysed via ANOVA and Bland-Altman plots at the match-level and error rates for specific stroke-types. No significant differences existed for stroke count between the algorithm and manual coding (p > 0.05). Significant (p < 0.0001) overestimation of "Other" strokes were observed from the algorithm, with no difference in groundstrokes and serves (p > 0.05). Serves had the highest accuracy of all stroke types (>= 98%). Forehand and backhand "drives" were the most accurate (>86%), with volleys mostly undetected (58-60%) and slices and end-range strokes likely misclassified (49-51%). The prototype algorithm accurately quantifies serves and forehand and backhand "drives" and serves. However, underestimations of shadow swings and overestimations of "other" strokes suggests strokes with reduced trunk rotation have poorer detection accuracy.

AB  - Wearable assistive technology for the lower extremities has shown great promise towards improving gait function in people with neuromuscular injuries. But common secondary impairments, such as hypersensitive stretch reflexes or hyperreflexia, have been often neglected. Incorporation of biomechanics into the control loop could improve individualization and avoid hyperreflexia. However, adding hyperreflexia prediction to the control loop would require expensive or complex measurement of muscle fiber characteristics. In this study, we explore a clinically accessible biomechanical predictor set that can accurately predict rectus femoris (RF) reaction after knee flexion assistance in pre-swing by a powered orthosis. We examined a total of 14 gait parameters based on gait kinematic, kinetic, and simulated muscle-tendon states from 8 post-stroke individuals with Stiff-Knee gait (SKG) wearing a knee exoskeleton robot. We independently performed both parametric and non-parametric variable selection approaches using machine learning regression techniques. Both models revealed the same four kinematic variables relevant to knee and hip joint motions were sufficient to effectively predict RF hyperreflexia. These results suggest that control of knee and hip kinematics may be a more practical method of incorporating quadriceps hyperreflexia into the exoskeleton control loop than the more complex acquisition of muscle fiber properties.

AB  - Many people die from lung and breast cancer or heart diseases every year due to a lack of taking diagnosis tests. These diseases are usually diagnosed when they have reached an advanced stage that is why it is so difficult or impossible to treat them. The early diagnosis of the disease requires periodically regular tests. However, it is almost unattainable for patients to go to a medical center to have tests frequently, because of the rush of everyday life. Two groups of nine women and nine men who had diseases such as breast or lung cancer, heart disease, or those who had the potential to suffer from these diseases, were selected for this research. A wearable hardware is designed and embedded in a belt to measure, collect, and transfer vital data such as ECG, body impedance, and some other body's information to a server for cloud processing, using the patient's cellphone as a communication interface. On the server, the data collected from the patients is compared to the stored data of other patients who have a similar disease. This comparison is made by a devised algorithm, which deploys the Probabilistic Neural Network as an inference, machine learning system to determine the course of disease changes or the process of disease recovery. The results show that the hardware and the algorithm applied in this study perform better at diagnosing lung cancer than breast cancer and heart disease.

AB  - Using a smartphone app, the investigators recruited 419,297 participants to be monitored for irregular pulses. Patterns suggesting atrial fibrillation were detected in 2161 participants who then received ECG monitoring devices to be worn for 7 days to confirm the presence or absence of atrial fibrillation.
   Background Optical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses. The ability of a smartwatch application (app) to identify atrial fibrillation during typical use is unknown. Methods Participants without atrial fibrillation (as reported by the participants themselves) used a smartphone (Apple iPhone) app to consent to monitoring. If a smartwatch-based irregular pulse notification algorithm identified possible atrial fibrillation, a telemedicine visit was initiated and an electrocardiography (ECG) patch was mailed to the participant, to be worn for up to 7 days. Surveys were administered 90 days after notification of the irregular pulse and at the end of the study. The main objectives were to estimate the proportion of notified participants with atrial fibrillation shown on an ECG patch and the positive predictive value of irregular pulse intervals with a targeted confidence interval width of 0.10. Results We recruited 419,297 participants over 8 months. Over a median of 117 days of monitoring, 2161 participants (0.52%) received notifications of irregular pulse. Among the 450 participants who returned ECG patches containing data that could be analyzed - which had been applied, on average, 13 days after notification - atrial fibrillation was present in 34% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 39) overall and in 35% (97.5% CI, 27 to 43) of participants 65 years of age or older. Among participants who were notified of an irregular pulse, the positive predictive value was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.92) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular pulse notification and 0.71 (97.5% CI, 0.69 to 0.74) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular tachogram. Of 1376 notified participants who returned a 90-day survey, 57% contacted health care providers outside the study. There were no reports of serious app-related adverse events. Conclusions The probability of receiving an irregular pulse notification was low. Among participants who received notification of an irregular pulse, 34% had atrial fibrillation on subsequent ECG patch readings and 84% of notifications were concordant with atrial fibrillation. This siteless (no on-site visits were required for the participants), pragmatic study design provides a foundation for large-scale pragmatic studies in which outcomes or adherence can be reliably assessed with user-owned devices.

AB  - Hands are vital in a wide range of fundamental daily activities, and neurological diseases that impede hand function can significantly affect quality of life. Wearable hand gesture interfaces hold promise to restore and assist hand function and to enhance human-human and human-computer communication. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current novel sensing interfaces and algorithms for hand gesture recognition, and the scope of applications covers rehabilitation, prosthesis control, exoskeletons for augmentation, sign language recognition, human-computer interaction, and user authentication. Results showed that electrical, mechanical, acoustical/vibratory, and optical sensing were the primary input modalities in gesture recognition interfaces. Two categories of algorithms were identified: 1) classification algorithms for predefined, fixed hand poses and 2) regression algorithms for continuous finger and wrist joint angles. Conventional machine learning algorithms, including linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines, random forests, and non-negative matrix factorization, have been widely used for a variety of gesture recognition applications, and deep learning algorithms have more recently been applied to further facilitate the complex relationship between sensor signals and multi-articulated hand postures. Future research should focus on increasing recognition accuracy with larger hand gesture datasets, improving reliability and robustness for daily use outside of the laboratory, and developing softer, less obtrusive interfaces.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent arrhythmia and is likely to cause strokes and damage to heart function in patients. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for detecting AF. However, ECGs have short boards with short monitoring cycles and problems with gathering. It is also difficult to detect a burst AF through ECG. In contrast, photoplethysmography (PPG) is easy to perform and suitable for long-term monitoring. In this study, we propose a method that combines time-frequency analysis with deep learning and identifies AF based on PPG. The advantage of the method is that there is no need for the noise filtering and feature extraction of PPG, and it has a high generalization capability. The data for the experiment came from three publicly accessible databases. The first part of the experimental method uses data augmentation to convert the 10 s PPG segment into a time-frequency chromatograph by means of time-frequency analysis. The second part inputs the chromatograph into a hybrid framework that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) for AF/nonAF classification. The experimental results show that the method has a high classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score, which are equal to 98.21%, 98.00%, 98.07% and 98.13%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.9959. The model we propose not only aids doctors in diagnosing AF but also provides a method for identifying AF through portable wearable devices.

AB  - Background and Objectives Post-discharge oncologic surgical complications are costly for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The capacity to predict complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients.
   Methods We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation.
   Results A logistic regression model with L-2 regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74.
   Conclusions PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications.

AB  - Background: Globally, diabetes has brought an enormous burden to public health resources, and the situation of disease burden caused by diabetes in China is especially severe. China is currently facing the dual threat of aging and diabetes, and wearable activity trackers could promote elderly diabetic patients' physical activity levels and help them to manage blood glucose control. Therefore, examining the influencing factors of elderly patients' adoption intention is critical as wearing adoption determines actual wearing behaviors.Objective: This study aims to explore the predicting factors of Chinese elderly type 2 diabetic patients' adoption intention to wearable activity trackers and their actual wearing behavior, using diffusion of innovation theory as the theoretical framework. We hope to provide insights into future interventions using wearable activity trackers as tools to improve the outcome of patients.Methods: Wearable activity trackers were freely distributed to type 2 diabetic patients in Beijing, China. A questionnaire survey was conducted to examine predicting factors of adoption intention after a week's try-on. Actual wearing behavior for 3-month was obtained from the exclusive cloud. Data were analyzed with structural equation modeling.Results: A total of 725 patients completed the questionnaire. Patients had a mean age of 60.3 +/- 7.6 years old and the educational level was generally lower. The results indicated that observability was the primary influencing factor of patients' adoption intention (beta = 0.775, P < 0.001). Relative advantage (beta = 0.182, P = 0.014) and perceived social image (beta = 0.080, P = 0.039) also had a positive influence while perceived risk (beta = -0.148, P < 0.001) exerted a negative influence. In addition, results showed that the more intention led to the better actual wearing behavior (beta = 0.127, P = 0.003). Observability (beta = 0.103, P = 0.005), perceived ease (beta = 0.085, P = 0.004), and relative advantage (beta = 0.041, P = 0.009) also indirectly influenced the wearing behavior.Conclusion: The intentions of Chinese elderly type 2 diabetic patients to wearable activity trackers directly influenced the actual wearing behavior. In addition, their adoption intention to wearable activity trackers was mainly influenced by observability, perceived ease to use, relative advantage, perceived risk, and social image.

AB  - Due to changing lifestyles, human physical exercise has dropped rapidly which leads to several health-related problems. It is not easy to detect heart-related diseases, but with the emergence and advancement in technologies like Edge, Fog computing, Machine learning, Cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT), it's a cinch to track heart diseases. Cloud computing provides the resources for computation as well as online storage over the internet, but it does not support latency-sensitive and real-time applications. To overcome this bottleneck, a new emerging technology named Edge Computing is used to bring the computation resource to local nodes for the services and reduces the latency as compared to the cloud. Current Edge computing-based models failed to achieve the output of real-time applications along with high accuracy and low latency simultaneously. Hence, we have proposed an autonomic Edge-assisted Cloud-IoT framework for smart healthcare that used a Random Forest and Logistic Regression Grid (RF-LRG) approach at edge nodes for analysis of heart disease and improves the various influential parameters such as accuracy (3.88%, 7.66% and 14.18%), precision (3.7%, 9%, and 16.6%), F1 Score (5%, 7.7%, and 16.9%.), recall (3.7%, 10.5%, and 15.06%.) compared with LR, RF and KNN algorithm. The simulation results ensured that the proposed framework using the RF-LRG algorithm predicted and diagnosed heart diseases with more accuracy and reduced the latency and energy consumption significantly when compared between the cloud and edge paradigms.

AB  - Blood glucose plays an important role in maintaining body's activities. For example, brain only uses glucose as its energy source. However, when blood glucose level is abnormal, it causes some serious consequences. For instance, low-blood glucose phenomenon referred to as hypoglycemia can cause heart repolarization and induce cardiac arrhythmia causing sudden cardiac deaths. Diabetes, which can be viewed as a high-blood glucose level for a long period of time, is a dangerous disease as it can directly or indirectly cause heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and other vicious diseases. A solution for reducing the serious consequences caused by diabetes and hypoglycemia is to continuously monitor blood glucose level for real-time responses such as adjusting insulin levels from the insulin pump. Nonetheless, it is a misstep when merely monitoring blood glucose without considering other signals or data such as Electrocardiography (ECG) and activity status since they have close relationships. When hypoglycemia occurs, a fall can easily occur especially in case of people over 65 years old. Fall's consequences are more hazardous when a fall is not detected. Therefore, we present a Fog-based system for remote health monitoring and fall detection. Through the system, both e-health signals such as glucose, ECG, body temperature and contextual data such as room temperature, humidity, and air quality can be monitored remotely in real-time. By leveraging Fog computing at the edge of the network, the system offers many advanced services such as ECG feature extraction, security, and local distributed storage. Results show that the system works accurately and the wearable sensor node is energy efficient. Even though the node is equipped with many types of sensors, it can operate in a secure way for up to 157 h per a single charge when applying a 1000 mAh Lithium battery. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Deep Learning-based Smart Healthcare is getting so much attention due to real-time applicability in everyone life's, and It has obtained more attention with the convergence of IoT. Diabetic eye disease is the primary cause of blindness between working aged peoples. The major populated Asian countries such as India and China presently account for millions of people and at the verge of an eruption of diabetic inhabitants. These growing number of diabetic patients posed a major challenge among trained doctors to provide medical screening and diagnosis. Our goal is to leverage the deep learning techniques to automate the detection of blind spot in an eye and identify how severe the stage may be. In this paper, we propose an optimized technique on top of recently released pre-trained EfficientNet models for blindness identification in retinal images along with a comparative analysis among various other neural network models. Our fine-tuned EfficientNet-B5 based model evaluation follows the benchmark dataset of retina images captured using fundus photography during varied imaging stages and outperforms CNN and ResNet50 models.

AB  - An intelligent closed-loop system that senses glucose and automatically delivers insulin can provide enhanced glycemic control for diabetes management. Here, we report for the first time on the development of a wearable, sensing-controlled, ultrasound-based closed-loop microneedle smart system for diabetes management. Polylactic acid (PLA) hollow microneedles were fabricated by soft lithography that can maintain excellent mechanical strength and stability in biofluids, followed by the deposition of sensing electrodes on the outer layer. An ultrasonic insulin pump was constructed by integrating a lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric (PZT) ring and a biocompatible stainless-steel sheet with hundreds of tapered holes on top of the inner layer of the microneedles. Both the sensor and the pump were powered and controlled by a printed circuit board (PCB). When the sensing device detects interstitial glucose levels above normal, the closed-loop control algorithm triggers the ultrasonic pump to deliver insulin into the interstitial fluid through the microneedle hollow channels of the PLA microneedles. The ultrasound from the pump can cause the vaporization of insulin in the subcutaneous tissue fluid, accelerate the diffusion rate, and improve the efficiency of insulin treatment and utilization. The system has successfully demonstrated effective control of glucose levels in diabetic rats. The glucose sensor showed a high sensitivity of 0.212 mu A/mM at 0-28 mM with a detection limit of 14 mu M, and the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) was 9.96% with an average error of 1.6 mM. The flow rate of the ultrasonic pump was 120 mu L/min, and the glucose-lowering rate was 4 mM/h. This work may open a new paradigm for the development of intelligent systems for diabetes management, as well as a wide range of practical applications in diabetes patients.

AB  - There is a consistent rise in chronic diseases worldwide. These diseases decrease immunity and the quality of daily life. The treatment of these disorders is a challenging task for medical professionals. Dimensionality reduction techniques make it possible to handle big data samples, providing decision support in relation to chronic diseases. These datasets contain a series of symptoms that are used in disease prediction. The presence of redundant and irrelevant symptoms in the datasets should be identified and removed using feature selection techniques to improve classification accuracy. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is a comparative analysis of the impact of wrapper and filter selection methods on classification performance. The filter methods that have been considered include the Correlation Feature Selection (CFS) method, the Information Gain (IG) method and the Chi-Square (CS) method. The wrapper methods that have been considered include the Best First Search (BFS) method, the Linear Forward Selection (LFS) method and the Greedy Step Wise Search (GSS) method. A Decision Tree algorithm has been used as a classifier for this analysis and is implemented through the WEKA tool. An attribute significance analysis has been performed on the diabetes, breast cancer and heart disease datasets used in the study. It was observed that the CFS method outperformed other filter methods concerning the accuracy rate and execution time. The accuracy rate using the CFS method on the datasets for heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer was 93.8%, 89.5% and 96.8% respectively. Moreover, latency delays of 1.08 s, 1.02 s and 1.01 s were noted using the same method for the respective datasets. Among wrapper methods, BFS' performance was impressive in comparison to other methods. Maximum accuracy of 94.7%, 95.8% and 96.8% were achieved on the datasets for heart disease, diabetes and breast cancer respectively. Latency delays of 1.42 s, 1.44 s and 132 s were recorded using the same method for the respective datasets. On the basis of the obtained result, a new hybrid Attribute Evaluator method has been proposed which effectively integrates enhanced K-Means clustering with the CFS filter method and the BFS wrapper method. Furthermore, the hybrid method was evaluated with an improved decision tree classifier. The improved decision tree classifier combined clustering with classification. It was validated on 14 different chronic disease datasets and its performance was recorded. A very optimal and consistent classification performance was observed. The mean values for accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and f-score metrics were 96.7%, 96.5%, 95.6% and 96.2% respectively.

AB  - Objective of this study is to introduce a secure IoHT system, which acts as a clinical decision support system with the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. In this sense, it was emphasized that the accuracy rate of diagnosis (classification) can be improved via deep learning algorithms, by needing no hybrid-complex models, and a secure data processing can be achieved with a multi-authentication and Tangle based approach. In detail, heart sounds were classified with Autoencoder Neural Networks (AEN) and the IoHT system was built for supporting doctors in real-time. For developing the diagnosis infrastructure by the AEN, PASCAL B-Training and Physiobank-PhysioNet A-Training heart sound datasets were used accordingly. For the PASCAL dataset, the AEN provided a diagnosis-classification performance with the accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, and the specificity of 100% whereas the rates were respectively 99.8%, 99.65%, and 99.13% for the PhysioNet dataset. It was seen that the findings by the developed AEN based solution were better than the alternative solutions from the literature. Additionally, usability of the whole IoHT system was found positive by the doctors, and according to the 479 real-case applications, the system was able to achieve accuracy rates of 96.03% for normal heart sounds, 91.91% for extrasystole, and 90.11% for murmur. In terms of security approach, the system was also robust against several attacking methods including synthetic data impute as well as trying to penetrating to the system via central system or mobile devices.

AB  - Automatic screening approaches can help diagnose Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) early, which is the leading source of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG)-based methods are frequently utilized to detect CVDs since they are a reliable and non-invasive tool. Due to this, Smart Cardiovascular Disease Detection System (SCDDS) has been offered in this manuscript to detect heart disease in advance. A wearable device embedded with electrodes and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors is utilized to record the EKG signals. Bluetooth is used to send EKG signals to the smartphone. The smartphone transfers the signals through an Android app to a pretrained deep learning-based architecture deployed on the cloud. The architecture analyzes the EKG signal, and a heart report is communicated to the patient and advises further preventive action. We offered an ensembled Convolution Neural Network architecture (ConvNet) and Convolution Neural Network architecture Long Short-Term Memory Networks (ConvNet-LSTM) architecture to detect atrial fibrillation heartbeats automatically. The architecture utilizes a convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network to extract local correlation features and capture the front-to-back dependencies of EKG sequence data. MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database was utilized to design the architecture and achieved an overall categorization accuracy of 98% for the test set's heartbeat data. The findings of this work show that the suggested system has achieved significant accuracy with the ensembling of models. Such models can be deployed in wearable devices and smartphones for continuous monitoring and reporting of the heart.

AB  - Subjective clinical rating scales represent the gold-standard for diagnosis of motor function following stroke. In practice however, they suffer from well-recognized limitations including assessor variance, low inter-rater reliability and low resolution. Automated systems have been proposed for empirical quantification but have not significantly impacted clinical practice. We address translational challenges in this arena through: (1) implementation of a novel sensor suite combining inertial measurement and mechanomyography (MMG) to quantify hand and wrist motor function; and (2) introduction of a new range of signal features extracted from the suite to supplement predicted clinical scores. The wearable sensors, signal features, and machine learning algorithms have been combined to produce classified ratings from the Fugl-Meyer clinical assessment rating scale. Furthermore, we have designed the system to augment clinical rating with several sensor-derived supplementary features encompassing critical aspects of motor dysfunction (e.g. joint angle, muscle activity, etc.). Performance is validated through a large-scale study on a post-stroke cohort of 64 patients. Fugl-Meyer Assessment tasks were classified with 75% accuracy for gross motor tasks and 62% for hand/wrist motor tasks. Of greater import, supplementary features demonstrated concurrent validity with Fugl-Meyer ratings, evidencing their utility as new measures of motor function suited to automated assessment. Finally, the supplementary features also provide continuous measures of sub-components of motor function, offering the potential to complement low accuracy but well-validated clinical rating scales when high-quality motor outcome measures are required. We believe this work provides a basis for widespread clinical adoption of inertial-MMG sensor use for post-stroke clinical motor assessment.

AB  - Background Wearable activity monitors that track step count can increase the wearer's physical activity and motivation but are infrequently designed for the slower gait speed and compensatory patterns after stroke. New and available technology may allow for the design of stroke-specific wearable monitoring devices, capable of detecting more than just step counts, which may enhance how rehabilitation is delivered. The objective of this study was to identify important considerations in the development of stroke-specific lower extremity wearable monitoring technology for rehabilitation, from the perspective of physical therapists and individuals with stroke. Methods A qualitative research design with focus groups was used to collect data. Five focus groups were conducted, audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using content analysis to generate overarching categories representing the stakeholder considerations for the development of stroke-specific wearable monitor technology for the lower extremity. Results A total of 17 physical therapists took part in four focus group discussions and three individuals with stroke participated in the fifth focus group. Our analysis identified four main categories for consideration: 1) 'Variability' described the heterogeneity of patient presentation, therapy approaches, and therapeutic goals that are taken into account for stroke rehabilitation; 2) 'Context of use' described the different settings and purposes for which stakeholders could foresee employing stroke-specific wearable technology; 3) 'Crucial design features' identified the measures, functions, and device characteristics that should be considered for incorporation into prospective technology to enhance uptake; and 4) 'Barriers to adopting technology' highlighted challenges, including personal attitudes and design flaws, that may limit the integration of current and future wearable monitoring technology into clinical practice. Conclusions The findings from this qualitative study suggest that the development of stroke-specific lower extremity wearable monitoring technology is viewed positively by physical therapists and individuals with stroke. While a single, specific device or function may not accommodate all the variable needs of therapists and their clients, it was agreed that wearable monitoring technology could enhance how physical therapists assess and treat their clients. Future wearable devices should be developed in consideration of the highlighted design features and potential barriers for uptake.

AB  - Diabetes, cancer, and heart diseases are identified to be fatal for human beings due to the lack of awareness, erratic food habits, lack of physical work and so forth. Many disease prediction systems are introduced by various researchers. However, early diagnosis of the diseases and monitoring systems are not working effectively and it increases the death rate. Recently, Internet of Things (IoT) is incorporated to collect the instant data from patient and the system makes effective decisions. Many IoT enabled healthcare systems are available for predicting the specific diseases but such effective healthcare system for measuring the severity of diabetes, cancer and heart diseases is scarce. For this purpose, a new neuro-fuzzy model is used in the proposed IoT enabled healthcare system for disease prediction, which combines fuzzy rules with temporal features. First, it categorizes the available features of the patient records. Second, a new temporal decision tree is introduced for learning the patient records carefully and predicting the record by using the available data. Third, the fuzzy temporal decision tree calculates the relationship between the available features and also selects them as contributed features. In addition, some of the features are identified as not useful for making a final decision, and these are to be removed. Fourth, the fuzzy rules are to be generated by using the Mamdani fuzzy membership function. Finally, a new framework is proposed which is the combination of neuro-fuzzy temporal networks, fuzzy temporal decision trees, and fuzzy temporal rules. The proposed model is evaluated by conducting experiments and proved as better than the existing systems in terms of prediction accuracy, error rate, and efficiency.

AB  - Early detection of Atrial Fibrillation (AFib) is crucial to prevent stroke recurrence. New tools for monitoring cardiac rhythm are important for risk stratification and stroke prevention. As many of new approaches to long-term AFib detection are now based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) recordings from wearable devices, ensuring high PPG signal-to-noise ratios is a fundamental requirement for a robust detection of AFib episodes. Traditionally, signal quality assessment is often based on the evaluation of similarity between pulses to derive signal quality indices. There are limitations to using this approach for accurate assessment of PPG quality in the presence of arrhythmia, as in the case of AFib, mainly due to substantial changes in pulse morphology. In this paper, we first tested the performance of algorithms selected from a body of studies on PPG quality assessment using a dataset of PPG recordings from patients with AFib. We then propose machine learning approaches for PPG quality assessment in 30-s segments of PPG recording from 13 stroke patients admitted to the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) neuro intensive care unit and another dataset of 3764 patients from one of the five UCSF general intensive care units. We used data acquired from two systems, fingertip PPG (fPPG) from a bedside monitor system, and radial PPG (rPPG) measured using a wearable commercial wristband. We compared various supervised machine learning techniques including k-nearest neighbors, decisions trees, and a two-class support vector machine (SVM). SVM provided the best performance. fPPG signals were used to build the model and achieved 0.9477 accuracy when tested on the data from the fPPG exclusive to the test set, and 0.9589 accuracy when tested on the rPPG data.

AB  - In the current age of technology, various diseases in the body are also on the rise. Tumours that cause more discomfort in the body are set to increase the discomfort of most patients. Patients experience different effects depending on the tumour size and type. Future developments in the medical field are moving towards the development of tools based on IoT devices. These advances will in the future follow special features designed based on multiple machine learning developed by artificial intelligence. In that order, an improved algorithm named Internet of Things-based enhanced machine learning is proposed in this paper. What makes it special is that it involves separate functions to diagnose each type of tumour. It analyzes and calculates things like the size, shape, and location of the tumour. Cure from cancer is determined by the stage at which we find cancer. Early detection of cancer has the potential to cure quickly. At a saturation point, the proposed Internet of Things-based enhanced machine learning model achieved 94.56% of accuracy, 94.12% of precision, 94.98% of recall, 95.12% of F1-score, and 1856 ms of execution time. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model, and the results of the simulation show that the proposed Internet of Things-based enhanced machine learning obtains a higher rate of intelligence than other methods.

AB  - Cognitive impairment has a significantly negative impact on global healthcare and the community. Holding a person's cognition and mental retention among older adults is improbable with aging. Early detection of cognitive impairment will decline the most significant impact of extended disease to permanent mental damage. This paper aims to develop a machine learning model to detect and differentiate cognitive impairment categories like severe, moderate, mild, and normal by analyzing neurophysical and physical data. Keystroke and smartwatch have been used to extract individuals' neurophysical and physical data, respectively. An advanced ensemble learning algorithm named Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) is proposed to classify the cognitive severity level (absence, mild, moderate, and severe) based on the Standardised Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) questionnaire scores. The statistical method "Pearson's correlation" and the wrapper feature selection technique have been used to analyze and select the best features. Then, we have conducted our proposed algorithm GBM on those features. And the result has shown an accuracy of more than 94%. This paper has added a new dimension to the state-of-the-art to predict cognitive impairment by implementing neurophysical data and physical data together.

AB  - High-dosage motor practice can significantly contribute to achieving functional recovery after a stroke. Performing rehabilitation exercises at home and using, or attempting to use, the stroke-affected upper limb during Activities of Daily Living (ADL) are effective ways to achieve high-dosage motor practice in stroke survivors. This paper presents a novel technological approach that enables 1) detecting goal-directed upper limb movements during the performance of ADL, so that timely feedback can be provided to encourage the use of the affected limb, and 2) assessing the quality of motor performance during in-home rehabilitation exercises so that appropriate feedback can be generated to promote high-quality exercise. The results herein presented show that it is possible to detect 1) goal-directed movements during the performance of ADL with a c-statistic of 87.0% and 2) poorly performed movements in selected rehabilitation exercises with an F-score of 84.3%, thus enabling the generation of appropriate feedback. In a survey to gather preliminary data concerning the clinical adequacy of the proposed approach, 91.7% of occupational therapists demonstrated willingness to use it in their practice, and 88.2% of stroke survivors indicated that they would use it if recommended by their therapist.

AB  - The main intention of this proposal is to design and develop a new heart disease prediction model via WBAN using three stages. The first stage is data aggregation, in which data is scheduled in Time Division Multiple Access manner based on priority level, and the data from the public benchmark datasets are collected representing WBAN. In the second stage, a channel selection is performed using a developed hybrid metaheuristic algorithm named Tunicate Swarm-Sail Fish Optimization (TS-SFO) Algorithm. The main intention of the suggested channel selection algorithm is to solve the multi-objective problem based on certain constraints like Reference Signal Received Quality, Signal to Noise Ratio and channel capacity. The third stage is the heart disease prediction stage, in which the feature extraction and prediction are performed. The data transmitted in the selected channel is used for the feature extraction phase, where the weighted entropy-based statistical feature extraction is developed and extracts the essential statistical features. Then, an enhanced Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is proposed by tuning certain parameters using the proposed TS-SFO for predicting heart disease with the help of extracted statistical features. Test results show that the flexible design and subsequent tuning of RNN hyper-parameters can achieve a high prediction rate.

AB  - As the aging and cancer populations in the world continue to increase, the need for complements to traditional geriatric assessments and the logical incorporation of fast and reliable telehealth tools have become interlinked. In the United States, studies examining the use of telehealth for chronic disease management have shown promising results in small groups. The implementation of health technology on a broader scale requires older adults to both accept and adapt such innovation into routine medical care. Though the commercial and recreational use of new technology has increased in older individuals, the transition into creating a smart and connected home that can interface with both patients and healthcare professionals is in its early phases. Current limitations include an inherent digital divide, as well as concerns regarding privacy, data volume, rapid change, cost and reimbursement. The emergence of low-cost, high-fidelity wearable sensors with a spectrum of clinical utility may be the key to increased use and adaptation by older adults. An opportunity to utilize wearable sensors for objective and real-time assessment of older patients with cancer for baseline functional status and treatment toxicity may be on the horizon.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases currently present a key health concern, contributing to an increase in death rates worldwide. In this phase of increasing mortality rates, healthcare represents a major field of research, and the knowledge acquired from this analysis of health information will assist in the early identification of disease. The retrieval of medical information is becoming increasingly important to make an early diagnosis and provide timely treatment. Medical image segmentation and classification is an emerging field of research in medical image processing. In this research, the data collected from an Internet of Things (IoT)-based device, the health records of patients, and echocardiogram images are considered. The images are pre-processed and segmented, and then further processed using deep learning techniques for classification as well as forecasting the risk of heart disease. Segmentation is attained via fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) and classification using a pretrained recurrent neural network (PRCNN). Based on the findings, the proposed approach achieves 99.5% accuracy, which is higher than the current state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - Machine learning methods have been widely used for gait assessment through the estimation of spatio-temporal parameters. As a further step, the objective of this work is to propose and validate a general probabilistic modeling approach for the classification of different pathological gaits. Specifically, the presented methodology was tested on gait data recorded on two pathological populations (Huntington's disease and post-stroke subjects) and healthy elderly controls using data from inertial measurement units placed at shank and waist. By extracting features from group-specific Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and signal information in time and frequency domain, a Support Vector Machines classifier (SVM) was designed and validated. The 90.5% of subjects was assigned to the right group after leave-one-subject-out cross validation and majority voting. The long-term goal we point to is the gait assessment in everyday life to early detect gait alterations.

AB  - A wearable ultrasound patch monitors subjects in motion using machine learning and wireless electronics.
   Recent advances in wearable ultrasound technologies have demonstrated the potential for hands-free data acquisition, but technical barriers remain as these probes require wire connections, can lose track of moving targets and create data-interpretation challenges. Here we report a fully integrated autonomous wearable ultrasonic-system-on-patch (USoP). A miniaturized flexible control circuit is designed to interface with an ultrasound transducer array for signal pre-conditioning and wireless data communication. Machine learning is used to track moving tissue targets and assist the data interpretation. We demonstrate that the USoP allows continuous tracking of physiological signals from tissues as deep as 164 mm. On mobile subjects, the USoP can continuously monitor physiological signals, including central blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output, for as long as 12 h. This result enables continuous autonomous surveillance of deep tissue signals toward the internet-of-medical-things.

AB  - Yoga has been a great form of physical activity and one of the promising applications in personal health care. Several studies prove that yoga is used as one of the physical treatments for cancer, musculoskeletal disorder, depression, Parkinson's disease, and respiratory heart diseases. In yoga, the body should be mechanically aligned with some effort on the muscles, ligaments, and joints for optimal posture. Postural-based yoga increases flexibility, energy, overall brain activity and reduces stress, blood pressure, and back pain. Body Postural Alignment is a very important aspect while performing yogic asanas. Many yogic asanas including uttanasana, kurmasana, ustrasana, and dhanurasana, require bending forward or backward, and if the asanas are performed incorrectly, strain in the joints, ligaments, and backbone can result, which can cause problems with the hip joints. Hence it is vital to monitor the correct yoga poses while performing different asanas. Yoga posture prediction and automatic movement analysis are now possible because of advancements in computer vision algorithms and sensors. This research investigates a thorough analysis of yoga posture identification systems using computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning techniques.

AB  - We propose a soft robotic ankle-foot-orthosis for post-stroke patients, which is inexpensive, lightweight, easy to wear, and capable of gait assistance for rehabilitation not only in the clinic but also in daily life. The device includes a 3D-printed flexible brace and an ankle supportthat allows natural flexion and extension of the ankle but provides support in the vertical direction preventing the structure from buckling. A bi-directional tendon-driven actuator was used for assisting both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The device also contains a wearable gait sensing module for measuring the leg trajectory and the foot pressures in real time for feedback control. Since the device is powered by a rechargeable battery and communicates with the main controller wirelessly, it is fully untethered, making it mobile and comfortable. Using the measured sensor data and the biomechanics of the legs, the real-time gait phase is detected, and then a gait assistance algorithm for both dorsiflexion and plantarflexion provides an accurate prediction of a control phase and timing although there are variations in the gait trajectories among individuals. As a feasibility test, the walking experiment was conducted with a post-stroke patient. The result showed improvement in both gait propulsion and foot-drop prevention.

AB  - Stroke is known as a major global health problem, and for stroke survivors it is key to monitor the recovery levels. However, traditional stroke rehabilitation assessment methods (such as the popular clinical assessment) can be subjective and expensive, and it is also less convenient for patients to visit clinics in a high frequency. To address this issue, in this work based on wearable sensing and machine learning techniques, we develop an automated system that can predict the assessment score in an objective manner. With wrist-worn sensors, accelerometer data is collected from 59 stroke survivors in free-living environments for a duration of 8 weeks, and we map the week-wise accelerometer data (3 days per week) to the assessment score by developing signal processing and predictive model pipeline. To achieve this, we propose two types of new features, which can encode the rehabilitation information from both paralysed and non-paralysed sides while suppressing the high-level noises such as irrelevant daily activities. Based on the proposed features, we further develop the longitudinal mixed-effects model with Gaussian process prior (LMGP), which can model the random effects caused by different subjects and time slots (during the 8 weeks). Comprehensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our system on both acute and chronic patients, and the promising results suggest its effectiveness.

AB  - A wearable electromagnetic belt system for the detection of hepatic steatosis (lipid accumulation within the major liver cells, hepatocytes), is proposed. To satisfy the requirements of the belt system, an array of body matched antennas is designed. The belt, which goes around the lower chest and over the liver, requires compact, wideband, unidirectional antennas that operate at low microwave frequencies. To avoid using conventional bulky reflector structures, the designed antenna utilizes the loop-dipole combination concept. To enhance electromagnetic wave penetration, the antenna is designed to match the human body. Thus, thanks to the high dielectric loading from the human body, the dipole element of the antenna is easily miniaturized. Since the same principle does not apply on the loop structure, meandered arc-shapes are employed to increase the effective electrical length of the loop. The final antenna design has a measured wide operating bandwidth of 0.58-1.6 GHz with a compact size of 0.096x0.048x0.048 lambda(3). The proposed structure is effective in irradiating the torso, where the signal can reach center of the liver at a depth of 90 mm, with 64% of the peak radiated power. An electromagnetic belt is built using twelve elements of the designed antennas. The belt is then tested on a 3D printed torso phantom that includes models of the lungs and liver. Due to close dielectric properties of the other tissues inside the torso, these are represented using an average tissue mimicking mixture with permittivity of 46. Measured data are analyzed using multivariate energy statistics method. A peak measured dissimilarity of 15.1% between steatotic and healthy liver is attained. These initial tests and obtained results indicate the potential of the proposed system as a method to diagnose hepatic steatosis.

AB  - In the modern world, wearable smart devices are continuously used to monitor people's health. This study aims to develop an automatic mental stress detection system for researchers based on Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from smart T-shirts using machine learning classifiers. We used 20 subjects, including 10 from mental stress (after twelve hours of continuous work in the laboratory) and 10 from normal (after completing the sleep or without any work). We also applied three scoring techniques: Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), Specific Fatigue Scale (SFS), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), to confirm the mental stress. The total duration of ECG recording was 1800 min, including 1200 min during mental stress and 600 min during normal. We calculated two types of features, such as demographic and extracted by ECG signal. In addition, we used Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Logistic Regression (LR) to classify the intra-subject (mental stress and normal) and inter-subject classification. The DT leave-one-out model has better performance in terms of recall (93.30%), specificity (96.70%), precision (94.40%), accuracy (93.30%), and F1 (93.50%) in the intra-subject classification. Additionally, The classification accuracy of the system in classifying inter-subjects is 94.10% when using a DT classifier. However, our findings suggest that the wearable smart T-shirt based on the DT classifier may be used in big data applications and health monitoring. Mental stress can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and various health problems. Therefore, real-time ECG signals help assess cardiovascular and related risk factors in the initial stage based on machine learning techniques.

AB  - Wrist-worn devices with heart rate monitoring have become increasingly popular. Although current guidelines advise to consider clinical symptoms and exercise tolerance during decision-making in heart disease, it remains unknown to which extent wearables can help to determine such functional capacity measures. In clinical settings, the 6-minute walk test has become a standardized diagnostic and prognostic marker. We aimed to explore, whether 6-minute walk distances can be predicted by wrist-worn devices in patients with different stages of mitral and aortic valve disease. A total ofn = 107 sensor datasets with 1,019,748 min of recordings were analysed. Based on heart rate recordings and literature information, activity levels were determined and compared to results from a 6-minute walk test. The percentage of time spent in moderate activity was a predictor for the achievement of gender, age and body mass index-specific 6-minute walk distances (p < 0.001;R-2 = 0.48). The uncertainty of these predictions is demonstrated.

AB  - Background:There is a need for simple clinical tools that can objectively assess the fall risk in people with dementia. Wearable sensors seem to have the potential for fall prediction; however, there has been limited work performed in this important area. Objective: To explore the validity of sensor-derived physical activity (PA) parameters for predicting future falls in people with dementia. To compare sensor-based fall risk assessment with conventional fall risk measures. Methods: This was a cohort study of people with confirmed dementia discharged from a geriatric rehabilitation ward. PA was quantified using 24-hour motion-sensor monitoring at the beginning of the study. PA parameters (percentage of walking, standing, sitting, and lying; duration of single walking, standing, and sitting bouts) were extracted using specific algorithms. Conventional assessment included performance-based tests (Timed Up and Go Test, Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment, 5-chair stand) and questionnaires (cognition, ADL status, fear of falling, depression, previous faller). Outcome measures were fallers (at least one fall in the 3-month follow-up period) versus non-fallers. Results: 77 people were included in the study (age 81.8 +/- 6.3; community-dwelling 88%, institutionalized 12%). Surprisingly, fallers and non-fallers did not differ on any conventional assessment (p = 0.069-0.991), except for 'previous faller' (p = 0.006). Interestingly, several PA parameters discriminated between the groups. The 'walking bout average duration', 'longest walking bout duration' and 'walking bout duration variability' were lower in fallers, compared to non-fallers (p = 0.008-0.027). The 'standing bout average duration' was higher in fallers (p = 0.050). Two variables, 'walking bout average duration' [odds ratio (OR) 0.79, p = 0.012] and 'previous faller' (OR 4.44, p = 0.007) were identified as independent predictors for falls. The OR for a 'walking bout average duration' <15 s for predicting fallers was 6.30 (p = 0.020). Combining 'walking bout average duration' and 'previous faller' improved fall prediction (OR 7.71, p < 0.001, sensitivity/specificity 72%/76%). Discussion: Results demonstrate that sensor-derived PA parameters are independent predictors of the fall risk and may have higher diagnostic accuracy in persons with dementia compared to conventional fall risk measures. Our findings highlight the potential of telemonitoring technology for estimating the fall risk. Results should be confirmed in a larger study and by measuring PA over a longer period of time.

AB  - Wearable devices have gained immense popularity among various pervasive computing and Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications in the past decade. Sports analytics researchers recently focused on improving a player's performance to help devise a winning strategy based on the player's gameplay. Especially in a racquet-based badminton sport, it is assumed that handling the racquet during the gameplay is one of the primary reasons to influence the players' performance. On the contrary, we posit that the players' stance, body movements, and posture are equally significant in evaluating a player's performance during the game. A shot characterized by a recommended posture, stance, and body movements allows a player to play a stroke efficiently, thus aiding the player in guiding the shuttle to strategic spots and making it difficult for the opponent to return the shot and score a point. Relying on this hypothesis, we propose DeCoach, a data-driven framework that leverages the stance and posture of the players and ranks them based on their performances. In this effort, we first employ a deep learning-based algorithm to classify the strokes and stances of the players. Secondly, we propose a distance-based methodology to compare the obtained stance of a player with that of a professional player. Finally, we devise a deep learning-based regressor to predict the player's performance which commences with ranking based on their performance. We evaluate DeCoach using our in-house dataset, Badminton Activity Recognition (BAR) Dataset that is collected using inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors by placing them on the upper and lower limbs of the players. The BAR dataset is collected from 11 players in the controlled and uncontrolled environment settings for 12 frequently played shots in the game. Empirical results indicate that DeCoach achieves 89.09% accuracy for strokes detection and R-2 score of 88.84% in estimating the players' performance. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Smartwatch and fitness band wearable consumer electronics can passively measure pulse rate from the wrist using photoplethysmography (PPG). Identification of pulse irregularity or variability from these data has the potential to identify atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF, collectively). The rapidly expanding consumer base of these devices allows for detection of undiagnosed AF at scale.
   Methods The Apple Heart Study is a prospective, single arm pragmatic study that has enrolled 419,093 participants (NCT03335800). The primary objective is to measure the proportion of participants with an irregular pulse detected by the Apple Watch (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA) with AF on subsequent ambulatory ECG patch monitoring. The secondary objectives are to: 1) characterize the concordance of pulse irregularity notification episodes from the Apple Watch with simultaneously recorded ambulatory ECGs; 2) estimate the rate of initial contact with a health care provider within 3 months after notification of pulse irregularity. The study is conducted virtually, with screening, consent and data collection performed electronically from within an accompanying smartphone app. Study visits are performed by telehealth study physicians via video chat through the app, and ambulatory ECG patches are mailed to the participants.
   Conclusions The results of this trial will provide initial evidence for the ability of a smartwatch algorithm to identify pulse irregularity and variability which may reflect previously unknown AF. The Apple Heart Study will help provide a foundation for how wearable technology can inform the clinical approach to AF identification and screening.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disturbance in clinical practice. It often starts with asymptomatic and very short episodes, which are extremely difficult to detect without long-term monitoring of the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG). Although recent portable and wearable devices may become very useful in this context, they often record ECG signals strongly corrupted with noise and artifacts. This impairs automatized ulterior analyses that could only be conducted reliably through a previous stage of automatic identification of high-quality ECG intervals. So far, a variety of techniques for ECG quality assessment have been proposed, but poor performances have been reported on recordings from patients with AF. This work introduces a novel deep learning-based algorithm to robustly identify high-quality ECG segments within the challenging environment of single-lead recordings alternating sinus rhythm, AF episodes and other rhythms. The method is based on the high learning capability of a convolutional neural network, which has been trained with 2-D images obtained when turning ECG signals into wavelet scalograms. For its validation, almost 100,000 ECG segments from three different databases have been analyzed during 500 learning-testing iterations, thus involving more than 320,000 ECGs analyzed in total. The obtained results have revealed a discriminant ability to detect high-quality and discard low-quality ECG excerpts of about 93%, only misclassifying around 5% of clean AF segments as noisy ones. In addition, the method has also been able to deal with raw ECG recordings, without requiring signal preprocessing or feature extraction as previous stages. Consequently, it is particularly suitable for portable and wearable devices embedding, facilitating early detection of AF as well as other automatized diagnostic facilities by reliably providing high-quality ECG excerpts to further processing stages.

AB  - In recent days, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Deep learning, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence are considered to be an emerging technologies to solve variety of real world problems. These techniques are importantly applied in various fields such as healthcare systems, transportation systems, agriculture and smart cities to produce fruitful results for number of issues in today's environment. This research work focuses on one such application in the field of IoT together with cloud computing. More number of sensors that are deployed in human body is used to collect patient related data such as deviation in body temperature and others which leads to variation in blood cells that turned to be cancerous cells. Main intention of this work is design a cancer prediction system using Internet of Things upon extracting the details of blood results to test whether it is normal or abnormal. In addition to this, encryption is done on the blood results of cancer affected patient and store it in cloud for quick reference through Internet for the doctor or healthcare nurse to handle the patient data secretly. This research work concentrates on enhancing the health care computations and processing. It provides a framework to enhance the performance of the existing health care industry across the globe. As the entire medical data has to be saved in cloud, the traditional medical treatment limitations can be overcome. Encryption and decryption is done using AES algorithm in order to provide authentication and security in handling cancer patients. The main focus is to handle healthcare data effectively for the patient when they are away from the home town since the needed cancer treatment details are stored in cloud. The task completion time is greatly reduce from 400 to 160 by using VMs. CloudSim gives an adaptable simulation structure that empowers displaying and reproduced results.

AB  - Background: Social isolation after a stroke is related to poor outcomes. However, a full study of social networks on stroke outcomes is limited by the current metrics available. Typical measures of social networks rely on self-report, which is vulnerable to response bias and measurement error. We aimed to test the accuracy of an objective measure-wearable cameras-to capture face-to-face social interactions in stroke survivors. If accurate and usable in real-world settings, this technology would allow improved examination of social factors on stroke outcomes. Methods: In this prospective study, 10 stroke survivors each wore 2 wearable cameras: Autographer (OMG Life Limited, Oxford, United Kingdom) and Narrative Clip (Narrative, Linkoping, Sweden). Each camera automatically took a picture every 20-30 seconds. Patients mingled with healthy controls for 5 minutes of 1-on-1 interactions followed by 5 minutes of no interaction for 2 hours. After the event, 2 blinded judges assessed whether photograph sequences identified interactions or noninteractions. Diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated. Results: A total of 8776 photographs were taken and adjudicated. In distinguishing interactions, the Autographer's sensitivity was 1.00 and specificity was .98. The Narrative Clip's sensitivity was .58 and specificity was 1.00. The receiver operating characteristic curves of the 2 devices were statistically different (Z = 8.26, P < .001). Conclusions: Wearable cameras can accurately detect social interactions of stroke survivors. Likely because of its large field of view, the Autographer was more sensitive than the Narrative Clip for this purpose.

AB  - The drastic increase in atmospheric pollutants has resulted in the prevalence of hazardous diseases like Asthma, Ischaemic heart disease, and Pulmonary disease around the world. IoT technology has the capability to acquire and monitor air quality parameters in the ambient environment of an individual. Inspired from these aspects, this paper proposes an IoT-based automated framework for monitoring and predicting air quality parameters like benzene using machine learning technology. Specifically, this study incorporates an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) technique to predict the air quality in the form of Level of Pollutant (LoP) and modified Air Quality Index (m-AQI). Moreover, for the optimisation of ANFIS technique, Differential Evolution (DE)-inspired algorithm has been proposed for overall enhancement of system accuracy. In order to validate the proposed model, numerous experimental simulations were performed over four challenging datasets and results were compared with several state-of-the-art models. Comparative analysis shows improved statistical values for the presented model in terms of Accuracy (97.3%), Coefficient of Determination (94.01%), and Root Mean Square Error (2.4%). In addition to these, enhanced values of performance estimators like Reliability (92.36%) and Stability (76.00%) were estimated for depicting overall efficiency of the proposed system.

AB  - This study aimed to quantify musculoskeletal symptoms/pain and characterize the physical demands at work and outside of work among precast concrete workers. Direct heart rate (HR) measurements and self-reported activity levels were used to estimate the physical demands. A total of 27 precast construction workers participated in a survey, and 21 wore a HR monitor smart watch for seven days. The HR data were parsed in minutes associated with occupational and nonoccupational physical activity. Correlation analysis and multivariate regression models were conducted to assess the associations between direct measured physical activity with self-reported physical activity, body mass index (BMI), years of work, smoking, and Borg ratings of perceived exertion (RPE). Approximately half of the participants experienced musculoskeletal symptoms in the last seven days and moderate functional limitations in carrying out activities of daily living (ADLs). The regression model revealed a positive relationship between direct measured moderate occupational physical activity (OPA) and the Borg RPE. Furthermore, an inverse association was found with BMI, smoking status, and years of work. The workers accrued a median of 415 min of moderate OPA per week. The findings showed a high amount of moderate OPA minutes per week and musculoskeletal issues among the precast concrete workers.

AB  - In recent years, particular attention has been devoted to continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform monitoring due to its numerous applications. However, existing solutions require users to be confined to particular locations, rely on dedicated and expensive hardware, or require active user participation. The constrained recording conditions prevent them from being deployed in many practical application scenarios. In view of this, we present VibCardiogram, a continuous and reliable design for estimating ECG waveform shape via ubiquitous wrist-worn wearables; it renders a personal ECG waveform shape estimating system with prolonged recording time accessible to a larger sector of the population. Instead of adding auxiliary sensors to wearables, VibCardiogram leverages the widely integrated motion sensor to characterize cardiac activities, and interpret them to generate an alternative signal that has the same waveform shape as the ECG signal. Specifically, VibCardiogram extracts the cardiogenic body vibrations from noisy sensor data. As the waveform variability and inconstant period hinder the segmentation of cardiac cycles, VibCardiogram extracts features and realizes accurate segmentation via machine learning. To parse cardiac activities from vibration signals, we build a deep-learning pipeline associating the encoder-decoder framework and Generative Adversarial Networks. With dedicated construction and training, it can estimate the ECG waveform accurately. Experiments with 20 participants show that VibCardiogram can achieve an average estimation error of 5.989% for waveform amplitude estimation, which is within the 10% margins regulated by the American National Standards Institute. Moreover, the promising results further confirm that VibCardiogram effectively extracts Heart Rate Variability features and supports downstream applications.

AB  - Lifestyle is a critical aspect of diabetes management. We aimed to define a healthy lifestyle using objectively measured parameters obtained from a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit) in patients with type 2 diabetes. This prospective observational study included 24 patients (mean age, 46.8 years) with type 2 diabetes. Expectation???maximization clustering analysis produced two groups: A (n=9) and B (n=15). Group A had a higher daily step count, lower resting heart rate, longer sleep duration, and lower mean time differences in going to sleep and waking up than group B. A Shapley additive explanation summary analysis indicated that sleep-related factors were key elements for clustering. The mean hemoglobin A1c level was 0.3 percentage points lower at the end of follow-up in group A than in group B. Factors related to regular sleep patterns could be possible determinants of lifestyle clustering in patients with type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Much of the information related to breathing is contained within the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, through changes in venous blood flow, heart rate and stroke volume. We aim to leverage this fact, by employing a novel deep learning framework which is a based on a repurposed convolutional autoencoder. Our corr-encoder model aims to encode all of the relevant respiratory information contained within photoplethysmography waveform, and decode it into a waveform that is similar to a gold standard respiratory reference - the Capnogram. The model is employed on two photoplethysmography data sets, namely Capnobase and BIDMC. We show that the model is capable of producing respiratory waveforms that approach the gold standard, while in turn producing state of the art respiratory rate estimates. We also show that when it comes to capturing more advanced respiratory waveform characteristics such as duty cycle, our model is for the most part unsuccessful. A suggested reason for this, in light of a previous study on in-ear PPG, is that the respiratory variations in finger-PPG are far weaker compared with other recording locations. Importantly, our model can perform these waveform estimates in a fraction of a millisecond, giving it the capacity to produce over 6 hours of respiratory waveforms in a single second. Moreover, we attempt to interpret the behaviour of the kernel weights within the model, showing that in part our model intuitively selects different breathing frequencies. The model proposed in this work could help to improve the usefulness of consumer PPG-based wearables for medical applications, where detailed respiratory information is required.

AB  - Objective: Observational studies on the use of commercially available wearable devices for infection detection lack the rigor of controlled clinical studies, where time of exposure and onset of infection are exactly known. Towards that end, we carried out a feasibility study using a commercial smartwatch for monitoring heart rate, skin temperature, and body acceleration on subjects as they underwent a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) challenge. Methods: Ten subjects underwent CHMI and were asked to wear the smartwatch for at least 12 hours/day from 2 weeks pre-challenge to 4 weeks post-challenge. Using these data, we developed 2B-Healthy, a Bayesian-based infection-prediction algorithm that estimates a probability of infection. We also collected data from eight control subjects for 4 weeks to assess the false-positive rate of 2B-Healthy. Results: Nine of 10 CHMI subjects developed parasitemia, with an average time to parasitemia of 12 days. 2B-Healthy detected infection in seven of nine subjects (78% sensitivity), where in six subjects it detected infection 6 days before parasitemia (on average). In the eight control subjects, we obtained a false-positive rate of 6%/week. Conclusion: The 2B-Healthy algorithm was able to reliably detect infection prior to the onset of symptoms using data collected from a commercial smartwatch in a controlled human infection study. Significance: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of wearables as a screening tool to provide early warning of infection and support further research on the use of the 2B-Healthy algorithm as the basis for a wearable infection-detection platform.

AB  - Since the emergence of digital and smart healthcare, the world has hastened to apply various technologies in this field to promote better health operation and patients' well being, increase life expectancy, and reduce healthcare costs. One promising technology and game changer in this domain is digital twin (DT). DT is expected to change the concept of digital healthcare and take this field to another level that has never been seen before. DT is a virtual replica of a physical asset that reflects the current status through real-time transformed data. This article proposes and implements an intelligent context-aware healthcare system using the DT framework. This framework is a beneficial contribution to digital healthcare and to improve healthcare operations. Accordingly, an electrocardiogram (ECG) heart rhythms classifier model was built using machine learning to diagnose heart disease and detect heart problems. The implemented models successfully predicted a particular heart condition with high accuracy in different algorithms. The collected results have shown that integrating DT with the healthcare field would improve healthcare processes by bringing patients and healthcare professionals together in an intelligent, comprehensive, and scalable health ecosystem. Also, implementing an ECG classifier that detects heart conditions gives the inspiration for applying ML and artificial intelligence with different human body metrics for continuous monitoring and abnormalities detection. Finally, neural-network-based algorithms deal better with ECG data than traditional ML algorithms.

AB  - Body mass index (BMI) plays a vital role in determining the health of middle-aged people, and a high BMI is associated with various chronic diseases. This study aims to identify important lifelog factors related to BMI. The sleep, gait, and body data of 47 middle-aged women and 71 middle-aged men were collected using smartwatches. Variables were derived to examine the relationships between these factors and BMI. The data were divided into groups according to height based on the definition of BMI as the most influential variable. The data were analyzed using regression and tree-based models: Ridge Regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Category Boosting (CatBoost). Moreover, the importance of the BMI variables was visualized and examined using the SHapley Additive Explanations Technique (SHAP). The results showed that total sleep time, average morning gait speed, and sleep efficiency significantly affected BMI. However, the variables with the most substantial effects differed among the height groups. This indicates that the factors most profoundly affecting BMI differ according to body characteristics, suggesting the possibility of developing efficient methods for personalized healthcare.

AB  - The rapid progress of artificial intelligence expands its wide applicability in Internet of Things (IoT). Meanwhile, data insufficient and data source privacy are key supply chain challenges facing IoT especially in the healthcare industry. To address this problem in healthcare IoT, in this article, we propose a skin cancer detection model based on federated learning integrated with deep generation model. First, we employ dual generative adversarial networks to address the problem of insufficient data. In addition, to improve the quality of generated images, we synchronously optimize the sharpness of images, Frechet inception distance, image diversity, and loss using knee point-driven evolutionary algorithm (KnEA). Then, we protect patient information privacy by training federated skin cancer framework. Finally, we employ the ISIC 2018 dataset to test the performance of the proposed training model under different situations, including using identically distributed data, nonidentically distributed data, a sparse convolutional neural network, and a fully connected convolutional neural network. The experiment results demonstrate that the accuracy and area under the curve reach 91% and 88%, respectively. This model can help resolve problems of insufficient data in smart medicine of IoT and protect the privacy of user data while also providing an excellent detection rate.

AB  - Wearable devices play a growing role in healthcare applications and disease prevention. We conducted a retrospective study to assess cardiovascular and pre-frailty risk during the Covid-19 shelter-in-place measures on human activity patterns based on multimodal biomarkers collected from smartwatch sensors. For methodology validation we enrolled five adult participants (age range: 32 to 84 years; mean 57 +/- 22.38; BMI: 27.80 +/- 2.95 kg/m(2)) categorized by age who were smartwatch users and self-isolating at home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Resting heart rate, daily steps, and minutes asleep were recorded using smartwatch sensors. Overall, we created a dataset of 464 days of continuous measurement that included 50 days of self-isolation at home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Student's t-test was used to determine significant differences between the pre-Covid-19 and Covid-19 periods. Our findings suggest that there was a significant decrease in the number of daily steps (-57.21%; -4321; 95% CI, 3722 to 4920) and resting heart rate (-4.81%; -3.04; 95% CI, 2.59 to 3.51) during the period of self-isolation compared to the time before lockdown. We found that there was a significant decrease in the number of minutes asleep (-13.48%; -57.91; 95% CI, 16.33 to 99.49) among older adults. Finally, cardiovascular and pre-frailty risk scores were calculated based on biomarkers and evaluated from the clinical perspective.

AB  - In recent years, the application of a smart city in the healthcare sector via loT systems has continued to grow exponentially and various advanced network intrusions have emerged since these loT devices are being connected. Previous studies focused on security threat detection and blocking technologies that rely on testbed data obtained from a single medical IoT device or simulation using a well-known dataset, such as the NSL-KDD dataset. However, such approaches do not reflect the features that exist in real medical scenarios, leading to failure in potential threat detection. To address this problem, we proposed a novel intrusion classification architecture known as a Multi-class Classification based Intrusion Detection Model (M-IDM), which typically relies on data collected by real devices and the use of convolutional neural networks (i.e., it exhibits better performance compared with conventional machine learning algorithms, such as naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM)). Unlike existing studies, the proposed architecture employs the actual healthcare IoT environment of National Cancer Center in South Korea and actual network data from real medical devices, such as a patient's monitors (i.e., electrocardiogram and thermometers). The proposed architecture classifies the data into multiple classes: Critical, informal, major, and minor, for intrusion detection. Further, we experimentally evaluated and compared its performance with those of other conventional machine learning algorithms, including naive Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression, using neural networks.

AB  - Overwork-related disorders, such as cerebrovascular/cardiovascular diseases (CCVD) and mental disorders due to overwork, are a major occupational and public health issue worldwide, particularly in East Asian countries. Since wearable smart devices are inexpensive, convenient, popular and widely available today, we were interested in investigating the possibility of using wearable smart electrocardiogram (ECG) devices to detect the mental fatigue state. In total, 35 healthy participants were recruited from a public university in East China. Throughout the entire experiment, each participant wore a wearable device that was further linked to a smartphone to upload the data based on Bluetooth transmission. To manipulate the fatigue state, each participant was asked to finish a quiz, which lasted for approximately 80 min, with 30 logical referential and computing problems and 25 memory tests. Eight heart rate variability (HRV) indicators namely NN. mean (mean of normal to normal interval), rMSSD (root mean square of successive differences), PNN50 (the proportion of NN50 divided by total number of NNs), TP (total spectral power), HF (high frequency from 0.15 Hz to 0.4 Hz), LF (low frequency from 0.04 Hz to 0.15 Hz), VLF (very low frequency from 0.0033 Hz to 0.04 Hz) and the LF/HF ratio were collected at intervals of 5 min throughout the entire experiment. After the feature selection was performed, six indicators remained for further analysis, which were the NN. mean, rMSSD, PNN50, TP, LF, and VLF. Four algorithms, support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), naive Bayes (NB), and logistic regression (LR), were used to build classifiers that automatically detected the fatigue state. The best performance was achieved by KNN, which had a CV accuracy of 75.5%. The NN. mean, PNN50, TP and LF were the most important HRV indicators for mental fatigue detection. KNN performed the best among the four algorithms and had an average CV accuracy of 65.37% for all of the possible feature combinations.

AB  - Heart rate is one of the most important diagnostic bases for cardiovascular disease. This paper introduces a deep autoencoding strategy into feature extraction of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, and proposes a beat-to-beat heart rate estimation method based on convolution autoencoding and Gaussian mixture clustering. The high-level heartbeat features were first extracted in an unsupervised manner by training the convolutional autoencoder network, and then the adaptive Gaussian mixture clustering was applied to detect the heartbeat locations from the extracted features, and calculated the beat-to-beat heart rate. Compared with the existing heartbeat classification/detection methods, the proposed unsupervised feature learning and heartbeat clustering method does not rely on accurate labeling of each heartbeat location, which could save a lot of time and effort in human annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method maintains better accuracy and generalization ability compared with the existing ECG heart rate estimation methods and could be a robust long-time heart rate monitoring solution for wearable ECG devices.

AB  - The IoT has applications in many areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture, to name a few. Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches.

AB  - Background Fertility awareness and menses prediction are important for improving fecundability and health management. Previous studies have used physiological parameters, such as basal body temperature (BBT) and heart rate (HR), to predict the fertile window and menses. However, their accuracy is far from satisfactory. Additionally, few researchers have examined irregular menstruators. Thus, we aimed to develop fertile window and menstruation prediction algorithms for both regular and irregular menstruators. Methods This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted at the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital in Shanghai, China. Participants were recruited from August 2020 to November 2020 and followed up for at least four menstrual cycles. Participants used an ear thermometer to assess BBT and wore the Huawei Band 5 to record HR. Ovarian ultrasound and serum hormone levels were used to determine the ovulation day. Menstruation was self-reported by women. We used linear mixed models to assess changes in physiological parameters and developed probability function estimation models to predict the fertile window and menses with machine learning. Results We included data from 305 and 77 qualified cycles with confirmed ovulations from 89 regular menstruators and 25 irregular menstruators, respectively. For regular menstruators, BBT and HR were significantly higher during fertile phase than follicular phase and peaked in the luteal phase (all P < 0.001). The physiological parameters of irregular menstruators followed a similar trend. Based on BBT and HR, we developed algorithms that predicted the fertile window with an accuracy of 87.46%, sensitivity of 69.30%, specificity of 92.00%, and AUC of 0.8993 and menses with an accuracy of 89.60%, sensitivity of 70.70%, and specificity of 94.30%, and AUC of 0.7849 among regular menstruators. For irregular menstruators, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 72.51%, 21.00%, 82.90%, and 0.5808 respectively, for fertile window prediction and 75.90%, 36.30%, 84.40%, and 0.6759 for menses prediction. Conclusions By combining BBT and HR recorded by the Huawei Band 5, our algorithms achieved relatively ideal performance for predicting the fertile window and menses among regular menstruators. For irregular menstruators, the algorithms showed potential feasibility but still need further investigation.

AB  - Sepsis is associated with high mortality-particularly in low-middle income countries (LMICs). Critical care management of sepsis is challenging in LMICs due to the lack of care providers and the high cost of bedside monitors. Recent advances in wearable sensor technology and machine learning (ML) models in healthcare promise to deliver new ways of digital monitoring integrated with automated decision systems to reduce the mortality risk in sepsis. In this study, firstly, we aim to assess the feasibility of using wearable sensors instead of traditional bedside monitors in the sepsis care management of hospital admitted patients, and secondly, to introduce automated prediction models for the mortality prediction of sepsis patients. To this end, we continuously monitored 50 sepsis patients for nearly 24 h after their admission to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Vietnam. We then compared the performance and interpretability of state-of-the-art ML models for the task of mortality prediction of sepsis using the heart rate variability (HRV) signal from wearable sensors and vital signs from bedside monitors. Our results show that all ML models trained on wearable data outperformed ML models trained on data gathered from the bedside monitors for the task of mortality prediction with the highest performance (area under the precision recall curve = 0.83) achieved using time-varying features of HRV and recurrent neural networks. Our results demonstrate that the integration of automated ML prediction models with wearable technology is well suited for helping clinicians who manage sepsis patients in LMICs to reduce the mortality risk of sepsis.

AB  - Background: Without timely diagnosis and treatment, tachycardia, also called tachyarrhythmia, can cause serious complications such as heart failure, cardiac arrest, and even death. The predictive performance of conventional clinical diagnostic procedures needs improvement in order to assist physicians in detecting risk early on.
   Objective: We aimed to develop a deep tachycardia onset prediction (TOP-Net) model based on deep learning (ie, bidirectional long short-term memory) for early tachycardia diagnosis with easily accessible data.
   Methods: TOP-Net leverages 2 easily accessible data sources: vital signs, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) acquired continuously by wearable embedded systems, and electronic health records, containing age, gender, admission type, first care unit, and cardiovascular disease history. The model was trained with a large data set from an intensive care unit and then transferred to a real-world scenario in the general ward. In this study, 3 experiments incorporated merging patients' personal information, temporal memory, and different feature combinations. Six metrics (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score, and precision) were used to evaluate predictive performance.
   Results: TOP-Net outperformed the baseline models on the large critical care data set (AUROC 0.796, 95% CI 0.768-0.824; sensitivity 0.753, 95% CI 0.663-0.793; specificity 0.720, 95% CI 0.645-0.758; accuracy 0.721; F1 score 0.718; precision 0.686) when predicting tachycardia onset 6 hours in advance. When predicting tachycardia onset 2 hours in advance with data acquired from our hospital using the transferred TOP-Net, the 6 metrics were 0.965, 0.955, 0.881, 0.937, 0.793, and 0.680, respectively. The best performance was achieved using comprehensive vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, and SpO(2)) statistical information.
   Conclusions: TOP-Net is an early tachycardia prediction model that uses 8 types of data from wearable sensors and electronic health records. When validated in clinical scenarios, the model achieved a prediction performance that outperformed baseline models 0 to 6 hours before tachycardia onset in the intensive care unit and 2 hours before tachycardia onset in the general ward. Because of the model's implementation and use of easily accessible data from wearable sensors, the model can assist physicians with early discovery of patients at risk in general wards and houses.

AB  - Objective Doppler ultrasonography of the common carotid artery is used to infer stroke volume change and a wearable Doppler ultrasound has been designed to improve this workflow. Previously, in a human model of hemorrhage and resuscitation comprising approximately 50,000 cardiac cycles, we found a strong, linear correlation between changing stroke volume, and measures from the carotid Doppler signal, however, optimal Doppler thresholds for detecting a 10% stroke volume change were not reported. In this Research Note, we present these thresholds, their sensitivities, specificities and areas under their receiver operator curves (AUROC). Results Augmentation of carotid artery maximum velocity time integral and corrected flowtime by 18% and 4%, respectively, accurately captured 10% stroke volume rise. The sensitivity and specificity for these thresholds were identical at 89% and 100%. These data are similar to previous investigations in healthy volunteers monitored by the wearable ultrasound.

AB  - There have been many attempts to predict new markets, including a new market for internet of things (IoT)-based healthcare and the IoT platform's ability to offer a variety of applications. It is anticipated that the market for these devices will continue to grow as the healthcare sector undergoes fast expansion. IoT can measure a user's kinetic data (calorie consumption, distance, number of steps, etc.) using wearable healthcare equipment. Most of the recent top research on IoT-based healthcare wearable devices (IWHDs) has, up to this point, concentrated on potential users. The medical industry and healthcare are being quickly changed by the use and adoption of wearable healthcare devices. This study intended to uncover the mediating impacts of "perceived ease of use", "perceived usefulness", and "community immersion" on the interactions between influencing factors (personalization, service convenience, interactivity), and the intention to utilize IHWDs. The moderating role of a consumer's innovativeness in the influence link between IHWD features on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness was also examined. The study found that personalization has a direct (+) impact on usage intention. Through this, it would be feasible to raise the intention of wearable medical devices being accepted if customized benefits that are thoroughly examined just for individuals are supplied. The association between personalization and continued use intention was shown to be partially mediated by perceived utility and community immersion. Additionally, the association between interactivity and continued use intention, was fully mediated by perceived usefulness and community immersion. By analyzing the elements influencing the usage intention of wearable healthcare devices, this study offers a marketing plan to increase the number of users. The internet of medical things (IoMT) sector has had compound growth of approximately 26% from 2018 to 2021, which is a remarkable accomplishment. The effectiveness of factors affecting IoT usage was examined in this study when applied to the actual IoT industry. First, patients with diabetes who previously had to check their blood sugar levels through a blood test can now check it through lifestyle management and steady glucose monitoring through IoMT glucose monitoring when the convenience and individuality of the service are improved. So far, 10% of all Americans have benefited from this device. Second, as an illustration of interactivity, an IoMT-connected inhaler used to assist asthma sufferers with breathing, notifies the user when the inhaler is left at home and reminds them of appropriate times to use the device. This subsequently resulted in saving 1 life out of every 3 deaths. In addition, the findings of this study may also provide a turning point for the design and development of cutting-edge IoT-based healthcare goods and services.

AB  - The need to develop patient-specific interventions is apparent when one considers that clinical studies often report satisfactory motor gains only in a portion of participants. This observation provides the foundation for "precision rehabilitation". Tracking and predicting outcomes defining the recovery trajectory is key in this context. Data collected using wearable sensors provide clinicians with the opportunity to do so with little burden on clinicians and patients. The approach proposed in this paper relies on machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinical score estimates from wearable sensor data collected during functional motor tasks. Sensor-based score estimates showed strong agreement with those generated by clinicians. Score estimates of upper-limb impairment severity and movement quality were marked by a coefficient of determination of 0.86 and 0.79, respectively. The application of the proposed approach to monitoring patients' responsiveness to rehabilitation is expected to contribute to the development of patient-specific interventions, aiming to maximize motor gains.

AB  - When exercising in a high-temperature environment, heat stroke can cause great harm to the human body. However, runners may ignore important physiological warnings and are not usually aware that a heat stroke is occurring. To solve this problem, this study evaluates a runner's risk of heat stroke injury by using a wearable heat stroke detection device (WHDD), which we developed previously. Furthermore, some filtering algorithms are designed to correct the physiological parameters acquired by the WHDD. To verify the effectiveness of the WHDD and investigate the features of these physiological parameters, several people were chosen to wear the WHDD while conducting the exercise experiment. The experimental results show that the WHDD can identify high-risk trends for heat stroke successfully from runner feedback of the uncomfortable statute and can effectively predict the occurrence of a heat stroke, thus ensuring safety.

AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) is a common chronic condition that affects over 26 million people worldwide. It is a progressive and debilitating disease with a broad symptom profile, intermittently marked by periods of acute decompensation. People with HF generally do not self-manage their condition well (eg, monitoring symptoms, taking medications regularly, physical activity, etc). A better understanding of self-care activities and what factors may indicate deterioration is warranted.Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and acceptability of using wearable cameras to assess self-care activities in people with HF. The study objectives were to (1) explore whether changes in self-care activities could be identified prior to hospitalization and (2) determine the acceptability of wearable cameras to people with HF.Methods: A total of 30 people recently diagnosed with HF wore a camera for a maximum of 30 days; the camera took a photo every 30 seconds in the forward-facing direction. At the end of the study, all 30 participants were presented with 8 statements of acceptability, scored on a 5-point Likert scale. To determine whether camera images could identify changes in self-care activities and lifestyle risk factors before hospitalization, we analyzed images from participants (n=8) who were hospitalized during the 30-day study period. Images from the period immediately prior to hospitalization and a comparison were selected for each participant. Images were manually coded according to 9 different event categories relating to self-care and lifestyle risk factors, and events were compared between the 2 periods.Results: The participants reported high acceptability for wearing the cameras, as most strongly agreed or agreed that they were comfortable to wear (28/30, 93%) and easy to use (30/30, 100%). The results of the camera image analysis showed that participants undertook fewer activities of daily living (P=.008) and were more sedentary (P=.02) prior to being hospitalized, compared to a period nonadjacent to hospitalization.Conclusions: Adults with HF were accepting of using a wearable camera for periods within a 30-day time frame. Wearable cameras were a feasible approach for providing data on selected self-care activities and lifestyle risk factors for HF and offer the potential to be a valuable tool for improving our understanding of self-care.

AB  - Background: Reduced engagement with habitual activity (HA) is associated with greater risk and progression of cognitive decline and falls in older adults and people with dementia. Understanding external and intrinsic factors that affect HA may provide novel targets for non-pharmacologic interventions. Objective: This study primarily aims to identify factors that influence HA in normal ageing and cognitive impairment, such as cognitive and motor problems and disease subtype. Methods: 108 older adults participated in this study; 36 with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), 30 with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), 16 with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), and 26 controls. A tri-axial accelerometer recorded continuous data of volume, variability, and pattern of HA over 7 days. Participants undertook a battery of cognitive and neuropsychological assessments. Results: One-way analysis of variance controlling for age and gender shows that people with DLB and PDD engage less with HA than controls (p <= 0.01), but there were no significant differences between AD and controls (p >= 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated motor disease and impairments in activities of daily living (ADLs) independently explained 10-26% of volume, variability, and pattern of HA in people with cognitive impairment. Conclusion: People with cognitive impairment have reduced HA engagement compared to controls. Motor disease and impairments in ADLs most strongly contribute to these findings and may be important to consider for disease management. Wearable technology can provide a personalised picture of an individual's daily behaviours and may be a useful tool for person-centred care.

AB  - Simple Summary Palliative care is a vital aspect of healthcare that aims to improve the quality of life for individuals battling life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. Our research delved into the potential of deep learning (DL) model approaches to predict survival outcomes for end-stage cancer patients. Furthermore, we compared the results of wearable-technology-based activity monitoring with traditional prognostic tools. Interestingly, we found that models trained using both clinical data and time series data demonstrated better performance than those trained solely with time series data. Our research findings are novel in the palliative care field since DL models are not typically employed for predicting survival outcomes. (1) Background: Predicting the survival of patients in end-of-life care is crucial, and evaluating their performance status is a key factor in determining their likelihood of survival. However, the current traditional methods for predicting survival are limited due to their subjective nature. Wearable technology that provides continuous patient monitoring is a more favorable approach for predicting survival outcomes among palliative care patients. (2) Aims and objectives: In this study, we aimed to explore the potential of using deep learning (DL) model approaches to predict the survival outcomes of end-stage cancer patients. Furthermore, we also aimed to compare the accuracy of our proposed activity monitoring and survival prediction model with traditional prognostic tools, such as the Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) and the Palliative Performance Index (PPI). (3) Method: This study recruited 78 patients from the Taipei Medical University Hospital's palliative care unit, with 66 (39 male and 27 female) patients eventually being included in our DL model for predicting their survival outcomes. (4) Results: The KPS and PPI demonstrated an overall accuracy of 0.833 and 0.615, respectively. In comparison, the actigraphy data exhibited a higher accuracy at 0.893, while the accuracy of the wearable data combined with clinical information was even better, at 0.924. (5) Conclusion: Our study highlights the significance of incorporating clinical data alongside wearable sensors to predict prognosis. Our findings suggest that 48 h of data is sufficient for accurate predictions. The integration of wearable technology and the prediction model in palliative care has the potential to improve decision making for healthcare providers and can provide better support for patients and their families. The outcomes of this study can possibly contribute to the development of personalized and patient-centered end-of-life care plans in clinical practice.

AB  - Advances in flexible and stretchable electronics, functional nanomaterials, and micro/nano manufacturing have been made in recent years. These advances have accelerated the development ofwearable sensors. Wearable sensors, with excellent flexibility, stretchability, durability, and sensitivity, have attractive application prospects in the next generation of personal devices for chronic disease care. Flexible and stretchable wearable sensors play an important role in endowing chronic disease care systems with the capability of long-term and real-time tracking of biomedical signals. These signals are closely associated with human body chronic conditions, such as heart rate, wrist/neck pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, and biofluids information. Monitoring these signals with wearable sensors provides a convenient and non-invasive way for chronic disease diagnoses and health monitoring. In this review, the applications of wearable sensors in chronic disease care are introduced. In addition, this review exploits a comprehensive investigation of requirements for flexibility and stretchability, and methods of nano-based enhancement. Furthermore, recent progress in wearable sensors-including pressure, strain, electrophysiological, electrochemical, temperature, and multifunctional sensors-is presented. Finally, opening research challenges and future directions of flexible and stretchable sensors are discussed.

AB  - Background: Caregiving is a complex, stressful activity, which frequently leads to anxiety and the development of depressive disorders. Recent advances in wearable sensing allows to monitor relevant physiological data of the caregiver for detecting anxiety spans and for enacting coping strategies to reduce their anxiety when needed.
   Objectives: This work proposes a method to infer anxiety states of caregivers when caring for people with dementia, by using physiological data.
   Methods: A model using Markov chains for detecting internal anxiety states is proposed. The model is tested with a physiological dataset gathered from a naturalistic enactment experiment with 10 participants. A visual analysis for observing anxiety states is employed. The Markov chain model is evaluated by using Inter-beat Interval (IBI) data to detect 4 internal states: "Relaxed", "Arousing", "Anxiety", and "Relaxing".
   Results: From the visual inspection of inter beat interval data, self-report and observation labels a total of 823 state segments were identified which contained the following states: 137 "relaxed", 91 "arousing", 410 "anxious", and 185 "relaxing". By using the average IBI value of 60 seconds segments as classification feature, the model was evaluated with a "leave one-out" cross validation with an average accuracy of 73.03%.
   Conclusions: We proposed a Markov chain model for internal anxiety state detection of caregivers that care for people with dementia. The model was evaluated in a naturalistic enactment experiment with 10 participants. The resulting accuracy is comparable to previous results on stress classification.

AB  - With more than 50 million people worldwide at risk of heart disease, early diagnosis of cardiovascular disease is essential. The classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings can diagnose Atrial Fibrillation (AF) and other types of arrhythmia. Short ECG segments recorded from wearable devices in an IoT-based system can further provide continuous abnormality detection. The performance of ECG classification is usually high in normal segments, but much lower in the target classes, i.e., AF and other arrhythmias, which could result from class imbalance and limited feature representation. Deep learning methods have been employed as feature extractors in previous studies. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) can generate rich features in different scales. But CNN may omit precise temporal information such as the duration between R-waves in two QRS waves (RR interval) irregularity, which is insensitive to noise segments. Thus, aiming at improving the classification performance of AF and other classes in short ECG segments, we propose a hybrid feature fusion method integrating the above-mentioned features. The fused features are trained and tested in a support vector machine classifier. The F1-score results show that our method outperforms not only the same CNN method without feature fusion in all the four classes, which average F1-score reached 84.3% and classification time per single sample of 0.005 s, but also several state-of-the-art methods, especially in the target classes, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. We then further discuss the impact of length on the performance of the proposed method, providing insights into future applications.

AB  - In this study a single wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) and machine learning methodologies were used to conduct player level evaluation and classification five prototype tennis strokes in real-time. The International Tennis Number (ITN) test was used to verify the accuracy of this IoT system in evaluating participant level. We conducted the ITN test on thirty-six participants and conducted one-way ANOVA on the ITN test results using IBM SPSS 26. The IMU in this study contained a tri-axis accelerometer (+/- 16 g) and tri-axis gyroscope (+/- 2000 degrees /s) worn on the participants wrist connected to a wireless low-energy Bluetooth smart-phone with data sent to the computer terminal by cloud storage. Data processing including preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction and classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) and Naive Bayes (NB) algorithms. One-way ANOVA analysis predicting participants ITN level and ITN field test scores yielded p < 0.001 at the three different skill levels tested. SVM (MinMax), SVM (Standardiser) and SVM (MaxAbsScaler) classified unique tennis strokes precision and recall factors at the three different skill levels reliably yielded in f1-scores above 0.90 for serve, forehand and backhand, with f1-scores for forehand and backhand volley scores falling below that. The results of this study suggest using a single six-axial 50 Hz IMU in combination with SVM and SVM + PCA represents a significant step towards a more reliable wearable tennis stroke performance and skill level real-time evaluation and feedback technology.

AB  - Background: We describe the feasibility of monitoring with a Textile Wearable Holter (TWH) in patients included in Crypto AF registry.
   Methods: We monitored cryptogenic stroke patients from stroke onset (<3 days) continuously during 28 days. We employed a TWH composed by a garment and a recorder. We compared two garments (Lead and Vest) to assess rate of undiagnosed Atrial Fibrillation (AF) detection, monitoring compliance, comfortability (1 to 5 points), skin lesions, and time analyzed. We describe the timing of AF detection in three periods (0-3, 4-15 and 16-28 days).
   Results: The rate of undiagnosed AF detection with TWH was 21.9% (32 out of 146 patients who completed the monitoring). Global time compliance was 90% of the time expected (583/644 h). The level of comfortability was 4 points (IQR 3-5). We detected reversible skin lesions in 5.47% (8/146). The comfortability was similar but time compliance (in hours) was longer in Vest group 591 (IQR [521-639]) vs. Lead 566 (IQR [397-620]) (p = 0.025). Also, time analyzed was more prolonged in Vest group 497 (IQR [419-557]) vs. Lead (336 h (IQR [140-520]) (p = 0.001)). The incidence of AF increases from 5.6% (at 3 days) to 17.5% (at 15th day) and up to 20.9% (at 28th day). The percentage of AF episodes detected only in each period was 12.5% (0-3 days); 21.7% (4-15 days) and 19% (16-28 days).
   Conclusions: 28 days Holter monitoring from the acute phase of the stroke was feasible with TWH. Following our protocol, only five patients were needed to screen to detected one case of AF. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Approximately 65% of the worldwide adult population has experienced stress, affecting their daily routine at least once in the past year. Stress becomes harmful when it occurs for too long or is continuous (i.e., chronic), interfering with our performance, attention, and concentration. Chronic high stress contributes to major health issues such as heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, and anxiety. Several researchers have focused on detecting stress through combining many features with machine/deep learning models. Despite these efforts, our community has not agreed on the number of features to identify stress conditions using wearable devices. In addition, most of the reported studies have been focused on person-specific training and testing. Thanks to our community's broad acceptance of wearable wristband devices, this work investigates a global stress detection model combining eight HRV features with a random forest (RF) algorithm. Whereas the model's performance is evaluated for each individual, the training of the RF model contains instances of all subjects (i.e., global training). We have validated the proposed global stress model using two open-access databases (the WESAD and SWELL databases) and their combination. The eight HRV features with the highest classifying power are selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) method, reducing the training time of the global stress platform. The proposed global stress monitoring model identifies person-specific stress events with an accuracy higher than 99% after a global training framework. Future work should be focused on testing this global stress monitoring framework in real-world applications.

AB  - The incorporation of the cloud technology with the Internet of Things (IoT) is significant in order to obtain better performance for a seamless, continuous, and ubiquitous framework. IoT has many applications in the healthcare sector, one of these applications is voice pathology monitoring. Unfortunately, voice pathology has not gained much attention, where there is an urgent need in this area due to the shortage of research and diagnosis of lethal diseases. Most of the researchers are focusing on the voice pathology and their finding is only to differentiating either the voice is normal (healthy) or pathological voice, where there is a lack of the current studies for detecting a certain disease such as laryngeal cancer. In this paper, we present an extensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques and studies of IoT frameworks and machine learning algorithms used in the healthcare in general and in the voice pathology surveillance systems in particular. Furthermore, this paper also presents applications, challenges and key issues of both IoT and machine learning algorithms in the healthcare. Finally, this paper highlights some open issues of IoT in healthcare that warrant further research and investigation in order to present an easy, comfortable and effective diagnosis and treatment of disease for both patients and doctors.

AB  - Background: As an emerging arrhythmia monitor, ambulatory smartwatch electrocardiogram (ECG) provides an option for home -based monitoring of delayed new-onset arrhythmic events after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We aimed to validate the diagnostic efficacy of a consumer smartwatch ECG in TAVR recipients, while further explore the occurrence rate of both tachy-and brady-arrhythmia for 30 days after discharge to support risk management. Methods: Consecutive TAVR recipients from February 26th, 2021 to December 13th, 2021 were enrolled prospectively, receiving simultaneous 24-hour Holter and 12-lead ECG compared with smartwatch ECG during hospitalization and daily smartwatch ECG collection for 30 days after discharge. Results: Among 110 patients, the efficacy of smartwatch ECG presented sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing atrial fibrillation (AF) as 1.00 and 0.97, left bundle branch block (LBBB) as 0.61 and 0.88, and right bundle branch block (RBBB) as 0.60 and 0.97, respectively, compared with 24-hour Holter; presented sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing AF as 0.88 and 1.00, LBBB as 0.90 and 0.96, and RBBB as 0.83 and 0.94, respectively, compared with 12-lead ECG. At 30-day follow-up, new-onset arrhythmia included new-onset severe conduction disturbance (SCD) (23.6%), new-onset AF (21.8%), new-onset permanent LBBB (14.5%) and new-onset permanent RBBB (0.9%); 69.2% (36/52) of early new-onset LBBB recovered at 30-day follow-up. Conclusions: The diagnostic efficacy of consumer smartwatch ECG in arrhythmic events among TAVR population was acceptable, which provided a recommendable option for home-based management.

AB  - Healthcare occupies a central role in sustainable societies and has an undeniable impact on the well-being of individuals. However, over the years, various diseases have adversely affected the growth and sustainability of these societies. Among them, heart disease is escalating rapidly in both economically settled and undeveloped nations and leads to fatalities around the globe. To reduce the death ratio caused by this disease, there is a need for a framework to continuously monitor a patient's heart status, essentially doing early detection and prediction of heart disease. This paper proposes a scalable Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things-(IoT-) based three-layer architecture to store and process a large amount of clinical data continuously, which is needed for the early detection and monitoring of heart disease. Layer 1 of the proposed framework is used to collect data from IoT wearable/implanted smart sensor nodes, which includes various physiological measures that have significant impact on the deterioration of heart status. Layer 2 stores and processes the patient data on a local web server using various ML classification algorithms. Finally, Layer 3 is used to store the critical data of patients on the cloud. The doctor and other caregivers can access the patient health conditions via an android application, provide services to the patient, and inhibit him/her from further damage. Various performance evaluation measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-measure, MCC-score, and ROC curve are used to check the efficiency of our proposed IoT-based heart disease prediction framework. It is anticipated that this system will assist the healthcare sector and the doctors in diagnosing heart patients in the initial phases.

AB  - The Apple Watch Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a digital feature that detects signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), a heart arrhythmia that can lead to stroke. Unlike AFib detection offered in a clinical setting to patients or those at higher risk, the Apple Watch ECG is a direct-to-consumer (DTC) product marketed to the healthy as a self performed medical test. The feature is incorporated in the design as one of many applications in a multifunctional smartwatch. The Apple Watch ECG signals the movement of consumer wearables into the domain of medical devices, and the highly contested practice of AFib screening. This article examines how this technology produces new avenues for medical overuse among people who are unlikely to gain clinical benefit, and who as active consumers become medicalised via taking part in disease-specific monitoring. Interviews with Apple Watch ECG consumers suggest their strongly trust in the Apple brand is amplified by the promissory quality of screening and technical innovation. What would otherwise be a costly clinical procedure is condensed into an accessible function in a wearable device. Consequently, AFib screening loses its clinical purpose, and is instead refashioned into a component of healthy lifestyle behaviour. Repeat self-screening becomes 'bundled' with similar health monitoring practices routinised in consumer wearables. Active uptake supports a market for the product and adds to the reputation of the Apple brand such that consumers become complicit in legitimising a medical practice that has limited clinical justification.

AB  - Smart wearables provide an opportunity to monitor health in daily life and are emerging as potential tools for detecting cardiovascular disease (CVD). Wearables such as fitness bands and smartwatches routinely monitor the photoplethysmogram signal, an optical measure of the arterial pulse wave that is strongly influenced by the heart and blood vessels. In this survey, we summarize the fundamentals of wearable photoplethysmography and its analysis, identify its potential clinical applications, and outline pressing directions for future research in order to realize its full potential for tackling CVD.

AB  - Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud platforms are broadly employed in numerous healthcare appli-cations. Instead of using the limited storage and processing power found in mobile devices, the vast amount of data generated by internet of things devices in healthcare sector can be evaluated on a cloud platform. In this article, the Self-Attention Convolutional Neural Network optimized with Season Optimization Algorithm is proposed for Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis using IoT and cloud computing in Smart Medical Big Data health care system (SACNN-SOA-CKD-IoT-CC). IoT devices, like wearable and sensors perform data acquisition process. For chronic kidney disease (CKD) diagnostic model, the self-Attention convolutional neural network (SACNN) is applied. But, the SACNN not divulge any optimization systems adoption to calculate the optimal parameters and to make sure the exact categorization of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). Therefore, the season optimization al-gorithm (SOA) is used to optimize SACNN. The proposed approach is implemented in python language its performance is analyzed with performance metrices, like sensitivity, accuracy, recall, f-measure, specificity, network latency, scalability, response time, delay, and accuracy. The proposed SACNN-SOA-CKD-IoT-CC method achieves higher accuracy in CKD dataset of 15.66 %, 21.65 % and 9.64 %, lower error rate of 11.27 %, 8.35 %, and 21.06 % compared to the existing methods, like intelligent internet of things with cloud centric clinical decision support scheme for the prediction of CKD (LR-AME-CKD-IoT-CC), diagnostic prediction method for CKD in internet of things (MLP-SVM-CKD-IoT-CC) and ensemble of deep learning based clinical decision support system for CKD detection in medical internet of things environment (EDL-CDSS-CKD-IoT-CC).

AB  - Nowadays, eHealth service has become a booming area, which refers to computer-based health care and information delivery to improve health service locally, regionally and worldwide. An effective disease risk prediction model by analyzing electronic health data benefits not only to care a patient but also to provide services through the corresponding data-driven eHealth systems. In this paper, we particularly focus on predicting and analysing diabetes mellitus, an increasingly prevalent chronic disease that refers to a group of metabolic disorders characterized by a high blood sugar level over a prolonged period of time. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is one of the most popular and simplest machine learning techniques to build such a disease risk prediction model utilizing relevant health data. In order to achieve our goal, we present an optimal K-Nearest Neighbor (Opt-KNN) learning based prediction model based on patient's habitual attributes in various dimensions. This approach determines the optimal number of neighbors with low error rate for providing better prediction outcome in the resultant model. The effectiveness of this machine learning eHealth model is examined by conducting experiments on the real-world diabetes mellitus data collected from medical hospitals.

AB  - Analysis of physiological and activity data from consumer smartwatches enables real-time detection, often before symptom onset, of COVID-19, as well as other respiratory illnesses and stress inducers.
   Consumer wearable devices that continuously measure vital signs have been used to monitor the onset of infectious disease. Here, we show that data from consumer smartwatches can be used for the pre-symptomatic detection of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We analysed physiological and activity data from 32 individuals infected with COVID-19, identified from a cohort of nearly 5,300 participants, and found that 26 of them (81%) had alterations in their heart rate, number of daily steps or time asleep. Of the 25 cases of COVID-19 with detected physiological alterations for which we had symptom information, 22 were detected before (or at) symptom onset, with four cases detected at least nine days earlier. Using retrospective smartwatch data, we show that 63% of the COVID-19 cases could have been detected before symptom onset in real time via a two-tiered warning system based on the occurrence of extreme elevations in resting heart rate relative to the individual baseline. Our findings suggest that activity tracking and health monitoring via consumer wearable devices may be used for the large-scale, real-time detection of respiratory infections, often pre-symptomatically.

AB  - BACKGROUND Consumer devices with broad reach may be useful in screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) in appropriate populations. However, currently no consumer devices are capable of continuous monitoring for AF.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of a smartwatch algorithm for continuous detection of AF from sinus rhythm in a free-living setting.
   METHODS We studied a commercially available smartwatch with photoplethysmography (W-PPG) and electrocardiogram (W-ECG) capabilities. We validated a novel W-PPG algorithm combined with a W-ECG algorithm in a free-living setting, and compared the results to those of a 28-day continuous ECG patch (P-ECG).
   RESULTS A total of 204 participants completed the free-living study, recording 81,944 hours with both P-ECG and smartwatch measurements. We found sensitivity of 87.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83.6%-91.0%) and specificity of 97.4% (95% CI 97.1%-97.7%) for the W-PPG algorithm (every 5-minute classification); sensitivity of 98.9% (95% CI 98.1%-99.4%) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI 99.1%-99.5%) for the W-ECG algorithm; and sensitivity of 96.9% (95% CI 93.7%-98.5%) and specificity of 99.3% (95% CI 98.4%-99.7%) for W-PPG triggered W-ECG with a single W-ECG required for confirmation of AF. We found a very strong correlation of W-PPG in quantifying AF burden compared to P-ECG (r = 0.98).
   CONCLUSION Our findings demonstrate that a novel algorithm using a commercially available smartwatch can continuously detect AF with excellent performance and that confirmation with W-ECG further enhances specificity. In addition, our W-PPG algorithm can estimate AF burden. Further research is needed to determine whether this algorithm is useful in screening for AF in select at-risk patients.

AB  - The coronary network is formed on the surface of the heart that pumps oxygen in the blood vessel. If these arteries narrow, the heart does not get enough oxygen-rich blood, especially in physical activity. Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is the result of injury or damage to coronary artery lining development. This damage can lead to fatty deposits of plaque build on the site of injury, and these deposits are made of cholesterol and other waste from the cells. This accumulation is called atherosclerosis. In the plaque rupture and break-off case, the platelet aggregation works in the region, trying to repair the vessel. This cluster can block arteries and reduce or block blood flow, leading to a heart attack. Things medical devices connected to a functional disease testing purposes other hardware. The instrument system had a touch screen interface for the user to analyze and process the input data. The purpose is to provide a survey of various clustering technologies for use in the medical field. The aim of this study to improve the clustering technology to enhance the design further. Disease-related symptoms user input data to the system attempts to match a file's occurrence and loaded into the input provided. If the symptoms are preloaded, find a match, resulting in a common prescription drug response and disease names in the system. Angina does not mean that a heart attack has occurred or is about to occur. Angina is the presence of coronary artery disease but does not indicate that part of the heart does not get enough blood supply. Symptomatic and wellbeing observing in the clinical business is a significant issue. Because of time requirements, individuals don't enter the medical clinic, prompting numerous medical issues in a second. The greater part of the medical care framework has been created to foresee and analyze the patient's wellbeing, chiefly because screen their wellbeing consistently, regardless of whether The occupied with their timetables. Numerous investigations have indicated that early forecast is the ideal approach to fix wellbeing, early analysis and help patients and their wellbeing cautioning.

AB  - This paper presents a heart disease prediction model. Among the recent technology, internet of things-enabled healthcare plays a vital role. The medical sensors used in healthcare provide a huge volume of medical data in a continuous manner. The speed of data generation in IoT healthcare is high so the volume of data is also high. In order to overcome this problem, the proposed model is a novel three-step process to store and analyze the large volumes of data. The first step focuses on a collection of data from sensor devices. In Step 2, HBase has been used to store the large volume of medical sensor data from a wearable device to the cloud. Step 3 uses Mahout for devolving logistic regression-based prediction model. At last, ROC curve is used to find the parameters that cause heart disease.

AB  - The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing is the most popular growing technology in the IT world. IoT integrated cloud computing technology can be used in smart cities, health care, smart homes, environmental monitoring, etc. In recent days, IoT integrated cloud can be used in the health care system for remote patient care, emergency care, disease prediction, pharmacy management, etc. but, still, security of patient data and disease prediction accuracy is a major concern. Numerous machine learning approaches were used for effective early disease prediction. However, machine learning takes more time and less performance while classification. In this research work, the Attribute based Searchable Honey Encryption with Functional Neural Network (ABSHEFNN) framework is proposed to analyze the disease and provide stronger security in IoT-cloud healthcare data. In this work, the Cardiovascular Disease and Pima Indians diabetes dataset are used for heart and diabetic disease classification. Initially, means-mode normalization removes the noise and normalizes the IoT data, which helps to enhance the quality of data. Rectified Linear Unit (RLU) was applied to adjust the feature weight to reduce the training cost and error classification. This proposed ABSHE-FNN technique provides better security and achieves 92.79% disease classification accuracy compared to existing techniques.

AB  - Background and Objective: The 6-min walk test (6MWT) is a common functional assessment test, but adverse events during the test can be potentially dangerous and can lead to serious consequences and low quality of life. This study aimed to predict the occurrence of adverse events during 6MWT, using continuous physiological parameters combined with demographic variables.Methods: 578 patients with respiratory disease who had performed standardized 6MWT with wearable devices from three hospitals were included in this study. Adverse events occurred in 73 patients (12.6%). ECG, respiratory signal, tri-axial acceleration signals, oxygen saturation, demographic variables and scales assessment were obtained. Feature extraction and selection of physiological signals were performed during 2-min resting and 1-min movement phases. 5-fold cross-validation was used to assess the machine learning models. The predictive ability of different models and scales was compared.Results: Of the 16 features selected by the recursive feature elimination method, those related to blood oxygen were the most important and those related to heart rate were the most numerous. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) had the highest AUC of 0.874 +/- 0.063 and the AUC of Logistic Regression was AUC of 0.869 +/- 0.067. The mMRC (Modified Medical Research Council) scale and Borg scale had the lowest performance, with an AUC of 0.733 and 0.656 respectively.Conclusion: It is feasible to predict the occurrence of adverse event during 6MWT using continuous physiological parameters combined with demographic variables. Wearable sensors/systems can be used for continuous physiological monitoring and provide additional tools for patient safety during 6MWT.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cause of death in women around the world. A new tool has been adopted based on thermal imaging, deep convolutional networks, health applications on smartphones, and cloud computing for early detection of breast cancer. The development of the smart app included the use of Mastology Research with the Infrared Image DMR-IR database and the training of the modified version of deep convolutional neural network model inception V4 (MV4). In addition to designing the application in a graphical user interface and linking it with the AirDroid application to send thermal images from the smartphone to the cloud and to retrieve the suggestive diagnostic result from the cloud server to the smartphone. Moreover, to verify the proper operation of the app, a set of thermal images was sent from the smartphone to the cloud server from different distances and image acquisition procedures to verify the quality of the images. Four effects on the thermal image were applied: Blur, Shaken, Tilted, and Flipping were added to the images to verify the detection accuracy. After conducting repeated experiments, the classification results of early detection of breast cancer, generated from the MV4, illustrated high accuracy performance. The response time achieved after the successful transfer of diagnostic results from the smartphone to the cloud and back to the smartphone via the AirDroid application is six seconds. The results show that the quality of thermal images did not affect by different distances and methods except in one method when compressing thermal images by 5%, 15%, and 26%. The results indicate 1% as maximum detection accuracy when compressing thermal images by 5%, 15%, and 26%. In addition, the results indicate detection accuracy increased in Blurry images and Shaken images by 0.0002%, while diagnostic accuracy decreased to nearly 11% in Tilted images. Early detection of breast cancer using a thermal camera, deep convolutional neural network, cloud computing, and health applications of smartphones are valuable and reliable complementary tools for radiologists to reduce mortality rates.

AB  - Smartness, which underpins smart cities and societies, is defined by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make decisions, all in a timely manner. Healthcare is the prime candidate needing the transformative capability of this smartness. Social media could enable a ubiquitous and continuous engagement between healthcare stakeholders, leading to better public health. Current works are limited in their scope, functionality, and scalability. This paper proposes Sehaa, a big data analytics tool for healthcare in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) using Twitter data in Arabic. Sehaa uses Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and multiple feature extraction methods to detect various diseases in the KSA. Sehaa found that the top five diseases in Saudi Arabia in terms of the actual afflicted cases are dermal diseases, heart diseases, hypertension, cancer, and diabetes. Riyadh and Jeddah need to do more in creating awareness about the top diseases. Taif is the healthiest city in the KSA in terms of the detected diseases and awareness activities. Sehaa is developed over Apache Spark allowing true scalability. The dataset used comprises 18.9 million tweets collected from November 2018 to September 2019. The results are evaluated using well-known numerical criteria (Accuracy and F1-Score) and are validated against externally available statistics.

AB  - Post-operative complications and hospital readmission are of great concern to surgical patients and health care providers. Wearable devices such as Fitbit wristbands enable long-term and non-intrusive monitoring of patients outside clinical environments. To build accurate predictive models based on wearable data, however, requires effective feature engineering to extract high-level features from time series data collected by the wearable sensors. This paper presents a pipeline for developing clinical predictive models based on wearable sensors. The core of the pipeline is a multi-level feature engineering framework for extracting high-level features from fine-grained time series data. The framework integrates a set of techniques tailored for noisy and incomplete wearable data collected in real-world clinical studies: (1) singular spectrum analysis for extracting high-level features from daily features over the course of the study; (2) a set of daily features that are resilient to missing data in wearable time series data; (3) a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method for imputing short missing heart rate segments; (4) the integration of patients' clinical characteristics and wearable features. We evaluated the feature engineering approach and machine learning models in a clinical study involving 61 patients undergoing pancreatic surgery. Linear support vector machine (SVM) with integrated feature engineering achieved an AUROC of 0.8802 for predicting post-operative readmission or severe complications, which significantly outperformed the existing rule-based model used in clinical practice and other state-of-the-art feature engineering approaches.

AB  - Objective: With the rapid rise of wearable sleep monitoring devices with non-conventional electrode configurations, there is a need for automated algorithms that can perform sleep staging on configurations with small amounts of labeled data. Transfer learning has the ability to adapt neural network weights from a source modality (e.g. standard electrode configuration) to a new target modality (e.g. non-conventional electrode configuration).
   Methods: We propose feature matching, a new transfer learning strategy as an alternative to the commonly used finetuning approach. This method consists of training a model with larger amounts of data from the source modality and few paired samples of source and target modality. For those paired samples, the model extracts features of the target modality, matching these to the features from the corresponding samples of the source modality.
   Results: We compare feature matching to finetuning for three different target domains, with two different neural network architectures, and with varying amounts of training data. Particularly on small cohorts (i.e. 2 - 5 labeled recordings in the non-conventional recording setting), feature matching systematically outperforms finetuning with mean percentage point improvements in accuracy ranging from 0.3% to 3.0% for the different scenarios and datasets.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that feature matching outperforms finetuning as a transfer learning approach, especially in very low data regimes.
   Significance: As such, we conclude that feature matching is a promising new method for wearable sleep staging with novel devices.

AB  - BACKGROUND Telemedicine and commercial wearable devices capable of detecting atrial fibrillation (AF) have revolutionized arrhythmia care during coronavirus disease 2019. However, not much is known about virtual patient-provider interactions or device sharing behaviors.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to characterize how participants with or at risk of AF are engaging with their providers in the context of telemedicine and using commercially wearable devices to manage their health.
   METHODS We developed a survey to describe participant behaviors around telemedicine encounters and commercial wearable device use. The survey was distributed to participants diagnosed with AF or those at risk of AF (as determined by being at least 65 years old and having a CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc stroke risk score of.2) in the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health Care system.
   RESULTS The survey was distributed to 23,530 patients, and there were 1222 (5.19%) participant responses. Among the participants, 327 (26.8%) had AF and 895 (73.2%) were at risk of AF. Neither device ownership nor device type use differed by AF status. After adjusting for covariates that may influence surveyed participant communication patterns, we found that participants with AF were more likely to share their wearable device-derived data with providers (adjusted odds ratio 1.87; 95% confidence interval 1.02-3.41). Rates of sharing physical activity or sleep data were low for both groups and did not differ by AF status.
   CONCLUSION Compared with participants at risk of developing AF, those with AF were more likely to share heart rate and rhythm data from their commercial wearable devices with providers. However, both groups had similar rates of sharing physical activity and sleep data, telemedicine engagement, and technology use and ownership.

AB  - Wearable sensors and social networking platforms play a key role in providing a new method to collect patient data for efficient healthcare monitoring. However, continuous patient monitoring using wearable sensors generates a large amount of healthcare data. In addition, the user-generated healthcare data on social networking sites come in large volumes and are unstructured. The existing healthcare monitoring systems are not efficient at extracting valuable information from sensors and social networking data, and they have difficulty analyzing it effectively. On top of that, the traditional machine learning approaches are not enough to process healthcare big data for abnormality prediction. Therefore, a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on the cloud environment and a big data analytics engine is proposed to precisely store and analyze healthcare data, and to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed big data analytics engine is based on data mining techniques, ontologies, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients' health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Protege Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Wearable devices based on inertial measurement units through wireless sensor networks have many applications such as real-time motion monitoring and functional outcome assessment of stroke rehabilitation. However, additional investigations are warranted to validate their clinical value, particularly in detecting the synergy patterns of movements after stroke.
   AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and efficacy of wearable devices for upper limb rehabilitation in patients with chronic stroke and to compare the intervention effects (e.g., neurological recovery, active range of motion, and deviation angle) with those in a control group.
   DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized-controlled pilot study.
   SETTING: Rehabilitation ward.
   METHODS: A total of 18 patients with chronic stroke were randomly distributed into a device group and control group. Both groups received conventional rehabilitation: nevertheless, the device group was additionally subjected to 15 daily sessions at least three times a week for 5 weeks. The outcome measures included the upper extremity subscores of the Fugl-Meyer assessment, active range of motion, and deviation angle. These measurements were performed pre- and post-treatment.
   RESULTS: All five Fugl-Meyer assessment subscores improved in both the device and control groups after intervention; in particular, the "shoulder./elbow/forearm" subscore (P=0.02, 0.03) and "total score" (P=0.03, 0.03) substantially improved. The active range of motion of shoulder flexion and abduction substantially improved at pre-post treatment in both the device (P=0.02, 0.03) and control (P=0.02, 0.03) groups. The deviation angle of shoulder external rotation during shoulder abduction substantially improved in the device group (P=0.02), but not in the control group.
   CONCLUSIONS: The designed wearable devices are practical and efficient for use in chronic patients with stroke.
   CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Wearable devices are expected to be useful for future internet-of-things rehabilitation clinical trials at home and in long-term care institutions.

AB  - Modern auscultation, using digital stethoscopes, provides a better solution than conventional methods in sound recording and visualization. However, current digital stethoscopes are too bulky and nonconformal to the skin for continuous auscultation. Moreover, motion artifacts from the rigidity cause friction noise, leading to inaccurate diagnoses. Here, we report a class of technologies that offers real-time, wireless, continuous auscultation using a soft wearable system as a quantitative disease diagnosis tool for various diseases. The soft device can detect continuous cardiopulmonary sounds with minimal noise and classify real-time signal abnormalities. A clinical study with multiple patients and control subjects captures the unique advantage of the wearable auscultation method with embedded machine learning for automated diagnoses of four types of lung diseases: crackle, wheeze, stridor, and rhonchi, with a 95% accuracy. The soft system also demonstrates the potential for a sleep study by detecting disordered breathing for home sleep and apnea detection.

AB  - Fatigue is a naturally occurring phenomenon during human activities, but it poses a bigger risk for injuries during physically demanding activities, such as gym activities and athletics. Several studies show that bicep muscle fatigue can lead to various injuries that may require up to 22 weeks of treatment. In this work, we adopt a wearable approach to detect biceps muscle fatigue during a bicep concentration curl exercise as an example of a gym activity. Our dataset consists of 3000 bicep curls from twenty middle-aged volunteers at ages between 27 to 30 and Body Mass Index (BMI) ranging between 18 to 28. All volunteers have been gym-goers for at least 1 year with no records of chronic diseases, muscle, or bone surgeries. We encountered two main challenges while collecting our dataset. The first challenge was the dumbbell's suitability, where we found that a dumbbell weight (4.5 kg) provides the best tradeoff between longer recording sessions and the occurrence of fatigue on exercises. The second challenge is the subjectivity of RPE, where we average the reported RPE with the measured heart rate converted to RPE. We observed from our data that fatigue reduces the biceps' angular velocity; therefore, it increases the completion time for later sets. We extracted a total of 33 features from our dataset, which have been reduced to 16 features. These features are the most overall representative and correlated with bicep curl movement, yet they are fatigue-specific features. We utilized these features in five machine learning models, which are Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forests (RF), Decision Trees (DT), and Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN). We found that using a two-layer FNN achieves an accuracy of 98% and 88% for subject-specific and cross-subject models, respectively. The results presented in this work are useful and represent a solid start for moving into a real-world application for detecting the fatigue level in bicep muscles using wearable sensors as we advise athletes to take fatigue into consideration to avoid fatigue-induced injuries.

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmias impose a significant burden on the healthcare environment due to the increasing ratio of mortality worldwide. Arrhythmia and abnormal ECG heartbeat are the possible symptoms of severe heart diseases that can lead to death. Premature ventricular contraction (PVC) is a common form of cardiac arrhythmia which begins from the lower chamber of the heart, and frequent occurrence of PVC beat might lead to mortality. ECG signals are the noninvasive and primary tool used to identify the actual life threat related to the heart. Nowadays, in society, the computer-assisted technique reduces doctors' burden to evaluate heart disease and heart arrhythmia automatically. Regardless of well-equipped and well-developed health facilities that are available for monitoring the cardiac condition, the success stories are yet unsatisfactorily due to the complexity of the cardiac disorder. The most challenging part in ECG signal analysis is to extract the accurate features relevant to the arrhythmia for classification due to the inter-patient variation. There are many morphological changes present in the ECG signals. Hence, there is a gap in the usage of appropriate methods for the extraction of features and classification models, which reduce the biased diagnosis of PVC arrhythmia. To predict PVC arrhythmia accurately is a quite challenging task owing to (a) QRS negative (b) long compensatory pause (c) p-wave (d) biased diagnosis of PVC detection due to the small feature set. This study presents a new approach for PVC prediction using derived predictor variables from the electrocardiograph (ECG-MLII) signals: R-R wave interval, previous R-R wave interval, QRS duration, and verification of P-wave whether it is present or absent using threshold technique. We propose the machine learning-data mining MACDM integrated approach using five different models of multiple logistic regression and four classifiers, namely, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support vector machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes (NB). The experiment was conducted on the public benchmark MIT-BIH-AR to evaluate the performance of our proposed MACDM technique. The multiple logistic regression models constructed as a function of all independent variables achieved an accuracy of 99.96%, sensitivity 98.9%, specificity 99.20%, PPV 99.25%, and Youden's index parameter 98.24%. Thus, it is proved that this computer-aided method helps our medical practitioners improve the efficiency of their services.

AB  - Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) plays an important role in dementia in elderly people, and refers to the contribution of vascular pathology to the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to severe dementia, as well as the pathological spectrum, from 'pure' Alzheimer disease through degrees of vascular comorbidity to 'pure' vascular dementia. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between cognitive dysfunction and systemic metabolic disorders, by employing deep learning (DL). We studied 202 patients (73.4 +/- 13.0 years), 94.6% of whom were undergoing treatment for lifestyle diseases, and 68.8% of whom had a history of cerebrovascular disorder. We evaluated cognitive dysfunction by performing a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). We performed general blood examination, including Complete Blood Count and Basic Metabolic Panel, and measured cerebral blood oxygenation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using time-resolved near infrared spectroscopy (TNIRS). We then used deep neural networks to assess the MMSE scores of the subjects based on the TNIRS parameters and the blood examination data, independently. Next, we compared predicted MMSE scores based on the TNIRS and the blood examination. There was a significant positive correlation between the TNIRS parameters and the blood examination data (r = 0.6, p < 0.01). These observations suggest that cognitive dysfunction in patients with VCI may be caused by combinations of systemic metabolic disorders such as energy and oxygen metabolisms and cerebral circulatory disturbance due to arteriosclerosis resulting from lifestyle-related diseases.

AB  - Background
   Hemiparesis is a common disabling consequence of stroke that leads to abnormal gait patterns marked by asymmetries in step length, stance, and swing phases. Asymmetric gait patterns are correlated with decreased gait velocity and increased susceptibility to falls that can lead to serious injuries and hospitalizations.
   Objective
   In this single group, before and after study, treatment with the iStride gait device, designed to improve the gait patterns of individuals with hemiparesis, is adapted to the home environment. Previously tested in clinical settings, this study investigates if using the iStride gait device within the home environment can provide safe and effective gait treatment for individuals with hemiparetic gait impairments caused by stroke.
   Methods
   Twelve 30-minute sessions of walking on the device were administered in each participant's home environment. Twenty-one participants who were more than one-year post-stroke received the treatment. The Ten-Meter Walk Test, Timed Up and Go Test, Berg Balance Scale, Functional Gait Assessment, and Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale were performed before and one week after treatment. Safety, treatment plan compliance, and subjective responses were also recorded during the study period.
   Results
   Results demonstrate statistically significant improvement on all five outcome measures from before treatment to one week after the last treatment session (p < 0.01) using two-tailed paired t-tests. 76% of participants improved beyond the small meaningful change or minimal detectable change on three or more outcome measures. 67% of participants improved clinically in gait speed and on at least one of the fall risk assessment inventories. 81% of the participants were able to perform the treatment in their home without assistance before the end of week three.
   Conclusions
   The results indicate that the iStride gait device can facilitate effective, safe, and home-accessible gait treatment opportunities for individuals with hemiparesis from stroke.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a wide range of applications in clinical practice, and new technologies are rapidly evolving the healthcare industry and enhancing outcomes. Smartwatches represent the most popular type of wearable AI device that can assist people in detecting cardiac arrhythmias via constant monitoring of heart activity. Numerous advantages result from integrating AI into healthcare systems, including improved patient care, lower rates of medical errors, better treatment recommendations, and more accurate diagnosis of diseases. However, doubts still remain regarding the adoption of AI into patient care due to the challenges it poses. In this paper, we report a case of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a young patient that was detected by his smartwatch. We also highlight some of the benefits and challenges of AI applications in healthcare.

AB  - A number of strategies empowered by Internet of Thing (IoT) have been utilized for the prediction of several dreadful diseases like diabetic for which ceaseless and real-time tracing system is an exceptionally predominant one. Wearable medical devices with sensor have consistently producing abundant data volume referred to as big data. With higher speed of data creation, it becomes cumbersome to accumulate, operate and analyze such abundant data volume during emergency. Deep Learning (DL) approaches have been largely made use of perceiving patterns, categorizing objects and the prediction of diabetic diseases at an early stage. Even so, DLs are fundamentally modest in evaluation precisely when the diabetic disease data size is abundant. To achieve the expectations of DLs for big data applications from an electronic device, the evaluation procedure for diabetic disease prediction must be speeded up, so that early analysis can be arrived at. In this work, a method called Equidistant Heuristic and Duplex Deep Neural Network (EH-DDNN) for early diabetic disease prediction is proposed. First, with the Big Data dataset as input, Equidistant Heuristic Pruning (EHP) algorithm is presented for feature selection. The EHP splits the input data matrix into rows and columns separately. By utilizing the notion of conditional non-alignment assessment and heuristics techniques, EHP, exploits neighbourhood evaluations into sub-division while reducing the communication time and overhead, thus enormously correlating computations. This in turn removes the irrelevant as well as redundant features, therefore resulting with fewer features easier for early prediction. Next, with the inherent features, a Duplex Deep Neural Network (DDNN) is designed for early prediction analyses a fusion of nonlinear processing features and linear response for stockpiling abundant data volume. Experiments are conducted and validation is performed on the benchmark datasets, Diabetes Data Set from UCI repository and Pima Indians Diabetes Disease dataset. Comparative analysis of diabetic disease prediction time, diabetic disease prediction overhead and ROC curve analysis are made.

AB  - Flexible and wearable electronic sensors are useful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of an individual's health state. Sampling of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from human breath/skin or monitoring abrupt changes in heart-beat/breath rate should allow noninvasive monitoring of disease states at an early stage. Nevertheless, for many reported wearable sensing devices, interaction with the human body leads incidentally to unavoidable scratches and/or mechanical cuts and bring about malfunction of these devices. We now offer proof-of-concept of nanoparticle-based flexible sensor arrays with fascinating self-healing abilities. By integrating a self-healable polymer substrate with 5 kinds of functionalized gold nanoparticle films, a sensor array gives a fast self-healing (<3 h) and attractive healing efficiency in both the substrate and sensing films. The proposed platform was used in sensing pressure variation and 11 kinds of VOCs. The sensor array had satisfactory sensitivity, a low detection limit, and promising discrimination features in monitoring both of VOCs and pressure variation, even after full healing. These results presage a new type of smart sensing device, with a desirable performance in the possible detection and/or clinical application for a number of different purposes.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) burden and duration appear to be related to stroke risk. A wearable consumer electronic device could provide long-term assessment of these measures inexpensively and noninvasively. This study compares the accuracy of an AF-sensing watch (AFSW; Apple Watch with KardiaBand) with simultaneous recordings from an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM; Reveal LINQ).
   Methods: SmartRhythm 2.0, a convolutional neural network, was trained on anonymized data of heart rate, activity level, and ECGs from 7500 AliveCor users. The network was validated on data collected in 24 patients with ICMs and a history of paroxysmal AF who simultaneously wore the AFSW with SmartRhythm 0.1 software. The primary outcome was sensitivity of the AFSW for AF episodes >= 1 hour. Secondary end points included sensitivity of the AFSW for detection of AF by subject and sensitivity for total AF duration across all subjects. Subjects with >50% false-positive AF episodes on ICM were excluded.
   Results: We analyzed 31348.9 hours (mean (SD), 11.3 (4.4) hours/day) of simultaneous AFSW and ICM recordings in 24 patients. The ICM detected 82 episodes of AF >= 1 hour while the AFSW was worn, with a total duration of 1127.1 hours. Of these, the SmartRhythm 2.0 neural network detected 80 episodes (episode sensitivity, 97.5%) with a total duration of 1101.1 hours (duration sensitivity, 97.7%). Three of the 18 subjects with AF >= 1 hour had AF only when the watch was not being worn (patient sensitivity, 83.3%; or 100% during time worn). Positive predictive value for AF episodes was 39.9%.
   Conclusions: An AFSW is highly sensitive for detection of AF and assessment of AF duration in an ambulatory population when compared with an ICM. Such devices may represent an inexpensive, noninvasive approach to long-term AF surveillance and management.

AB  - The classification of brain tumors (BT) is significantly essential for the diagnosis of Brian cancer (BC) in IoT-healthcare systems. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques based on Computer aided diagnostic systems (CADS) are mostly used for the accurate detection of brain cancer. However, due to the inaccuracy of artificial diagnostic systems, medical professionals are not effectively incorporating them into the diagnosis process of Brain Cancer. In this research study, we proposed a robust brain tumor classification method using Deep Learning (DL) techniques to address the lack of accuracy issue in existing artificial diagnosis systems. In the design of the proposed approach, an improved convolution neural network (CNN) is used to classify brain tumors employing brain magnetic resonance (MR) image data. The model classification performance has improved by incorporating data augmentation and transfer learning methods. The results confirmed that the model obtained high accuracy compared to the baseline models. Based on high predictive results we suggest the proposed model for brain cancer diagnosis in IoT-healthcare systems.

AB  - Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common upper-airway disease, is closely associated with the risk of cardiovascular diseases. However, the early screening of OSA is a main challenge, relying on polysomnography (PSG) or home sleep apnea test (HSAT) in hospitals. Photoplethysmography (PPG) has been developed as a novel technology for screening of OSA, while the validation of PPG-based smart devices is limited compared to that for PSG or HSAT devices. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and validity of a PPG-based smartwatch in the screening of OSA. Methods: A total of 119 patients were recruited from the Chinese People's Liberty Army General Hospital (Beijing, China). Among them, 20 patients were assessed for a whole-night sleep study by a smartwatch and PSG simultaneously, as well as 82 cases by a smartwatch and HSAT simultaneously. Using PSG or HSAT as the "gold standard", we compared the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and positive likelihood ratio (+LR) or negative likelihood ratio (-LR) at three apnea hypopnea index (AHI) levels: AHI>5, AHI>15, and AHI>30. Results: A total of 17/119 patients were excluded from the study due to the poor quality of PPG signals. Among the remaining cases, 83 patients were diagnosed with OSA. Compared to HSAT device, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the PPG-based smartwatch in predicting moderate-to-severe OSA patients (AHI>15) were 87.9%, 89.7%, and 86.0%, respectively. Compared to PSG device, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the PPG-based smartwatch in predicting OSA in patients (AHI>5) were 81.1%, 76.5%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: The PPG-based smartwatch outperformed in terms of detecting OSA; nevertheless, validation in a large-scale population is imperative.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization, the world's leading cause of death is heart disease, with nearly two million deaths per year. Although some factors are not possible to change, there are some keys that help to prevent heart diseases. One of the most important keys is to keep an active daily life, with moderate exercise. However, deciding what a moderate exercise is or when a slightly abnormal heart rate value is a risk depends on the person and the activity. In this paper we propose a context-aware system that is able to determine the activity the person is performing in an unobtrusive way. Then, we have defined ontology to represent the available knowledge about the person (biometric data, fitness status, medical information, etc.) and her current activity (level of intensity, heart rate recommended for that activity, etc.). With such knowledge, a set of expert rules based on this ontology are involved in a reasoning process to infer levels of alerts or suggestions for the users when the intensity of the activity is detected as dangerous for her health. We show how this approach can be accomplished by using only everyday devices such as a smartphone and a smartwatch.

AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly associated with cardiovascular diseases, but most patients remain undiagnosed. Cyclic variation of heart rate (CVHR) occurs during the night, and R-R interval (RRI) analysis using a Holter electrocardiogram has been reported to be useful in screening for OSA. We investigated the usefulness of RRI analysis to identify OSA using the wearable heart rate sensor WHS-1 and newly developed algorithm. WHS-1 and polysomnography simultaneously applied to 30 cases of OSA. By using the RRI averages calculated for each time series, tachycardia with CVHR was identified. The ratio of integrated RRIs determined by integrated RRIs during CVHR and over all sleep time were calculated by our newly developed method. The patient was diagnosed as OSA according to the predetermined criteria. It correlated with the apnea hypopnea index and 3% oxygen desaturation index. In the multivariate analysis, it was extracted as a factor defining the apnea hypopnea index (r = 0.663, p = 0.003) and 3% oxygen saturation index (r = 0.637, p = 0.008). Twenty-five patients could be identified as OSA. We developed the RRI analysis using the wearable heart rate sensor WHS-1 and a new algorithm, which may become an expeditious and cost-effective screening tool for identifying OSA.

AB  - Deep learning has achieved promising results on a broad spectrum of tasks using an end-to-end approach, and domain-specific knowledge can be used to supplement it by either constraining the solution-space, or to transform data such that relevant signals are more influential during the training process. This is especially important in the context of continuous recordings or wearable-based monitoring, where signal quality may be constrained by hardware, such as a limited number of available electrodes, or by external perturbations. In this study, a global feature extraction method for multi-periodic signals is proposed, which effectively classifies multi-cycle normal and abnormal heartbeats. The abnormal heartbeats are classed as the Left Bundle Branch Block beat (LBBB), Right Bundle Branch Block beat (RBBB), and Paced beat (P). The signal analysis process of the electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings consist of three main stages: (I) segmentation of the ECG data and partitioning of the data set; (II) generation of an overall feature map representing the "heartbeat condition"based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD); and (III) a classification stage for determining the patient's heartbeat condition. The extracted feature image is used to classify the heartbeat condition using a two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This method is applied to the publicly available MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. Experimental results show that the reconstructed ECG features outperform use of the raw ECG signals. Under self-test conditions of 3 min of ECG signal, the Total Classification Accuracy (TCA) was approximately 99.01%, while the TCA without the proposed method was approximately 90.69%.

AB  - Wearable devices such as smartwatches, wristbands, and GPS shoes are commonly employed for fitness and wellness as they enable people to observe their day-to-day health status. These gadgets encompass sensors to accumulate data related to user activities. Clinical act graph devices come under the class of wearables worn on the wrist to compute the sleep parameters by storing sleep movements. Sleep is very important for a healthy lifestyle. Inadequate sleep can obstruct physical, emotional, and mental health, and could result in several illnesses such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, heart disease, stress, etc. Recently, deep learning (DL) models have been employed for predicting sleep quality depending upon the wearables data from the period of being awake. In this aspect, this study develops a new wearables-assisted smart health monitoring for sleep quality prediction using optimal deep learning (WSHMSQP-ODL) model. The presented WSHMSQP-ODL technique initially enables the wearables to gather sleep-activity-related data. Next, data pre-processing is performed to transform the data into a uniform format. For sleep quality prediction, the WSHMSQP-ODL model uses the deep belief network (DBN) model. To enhance the sleep quality prediction performance of the DBN model, the enhanced seagull optimization (ESGO) algorithm is used for hyperparameter tuning. The experimental results of the WSHMSQP-ODL method are examined under different measures. An extensive comparison study shows the significant performance of the WSHMSQP-ODL model over other models.

AB  - The explosive data growth in the current information age requires consistent new methodologies harmonized with the new IoT era for data analysis in a space-time context. Moreover, intuitive data visualization is a central feature in exploring, interpreting, and extracting specific insights for subsequent numerical data representation. This integrated process is normally based on the definition of relevant metrics and specific performance indicators, both computed upon continuous real-time data, considering the specificities of a particular application case for data validation. This article presents an IoT-oriented evaluation tool for Radon Risk Management (RRM), based on the design of a simple and intuitive Indoor Radon Risk Exposure Indicator (IRREI), specifically tailored to be used as a decision-making aid tool for building owners, building designers, and buildings managers, or simply as an alert flag for the problem awareness of ordinary citizens. The proposed methodology was designed for graphic representation aligned with the requirements of the current IoT age, i.e., the methodology is robust enough for continuous data collection with specific Spatio-temporal attributes and, therefore, a set of adequate Radon risk-related metrics can be extracted and proposed. Metrics are summarized considering the application case, taken as a case study for data validation, by including relevant variables to frame the study, such as the regulatory International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) dosimetric limits, building occupancy (spatial dimension), and occupants' exposure periods (temporal dimension). This work has the following main contributions: (1) providing a historical perspective regarding RRM indicator evolution along time; (2) outlining both the formulation and the validation of the proposed IRREI indicator; (3) implementing an IoT-oriented methodology for an RRM indicator; and (4) a discussion on Radon risk public perception, undertaken based on the results obtained after assessment of the IRREI indicator by applying a screening questionnaire with a total of 873 valid answers.

AB  - This paper presents a handwriting recognition (HWR) system that deals with online character recognition in real-time. Our sensor-enhanced ballpoint pen delivers sensor data streams from triaxial acceleration, gyroscope, magnetometer and force signals at 100 HZ. As most existing datasets do not meet the requirements of online handwriting recognition and as they have been collected using specific equipment under constrained conditions, we propose a novel online handwriting dataset acquired from 119 writers consisting of 31,275 uppercase and lowercase English alphabet character recordings (52 classes) as part of the UbiComp 2020 Time Series Classification Challenge. Our novel OnHW-chars dataset allows for the evaluations of uppercase, lowercase and combined classification tasks, on both writer-dependent (WD) and writer-independent (WI) classes and we show that properly tuned machine learning pipelines as well as deep learning classifiers (such as CNNs, LSTMs, and BiLSTMs) yield accuracies up to 90 % for the WD task and 83 % for the WI task for uppercase characters. Our baseline implementations together with the rich and publicly available OnHW dataset serve as a baseline for future research in that area.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) framework is moving the research community to provide smart systems and solutions aimed at revolutionizing medical sciences and healthcare. Given the extreme diffusion of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), the demand for a solution to early detect neurological symptoms of such diseases strongly arose. According to the medical literature, such early detection can be obtained through the correlation between PD and AD and some external symptoms: the Essential Tremor (ET) and the number of Eye Blinks (EBs). In this paper, which can be considered as an extended version of In we present a prototype of wearable smart glasses able to detect the presence of ET of the head and to count the number of EBs at the same time, in a transparent way with respect to the final user. Numerical results demonstrate the reliability of the proposed approach: the proposed algorithms are able to i) correctly recognize the ET with an overall accuracy above 97% and ii) count the number of EBs with an overall error around 9%.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has been influential in predicting major diseases in current practice. The deep learning (DL) technique is vital in monitoring and controlling the functioning of the healthcare system and ensuring an effective decision-making process. In this study, we aimed to develop a framework implementing the IoT and DL to identify lung cancer. The accurate and efficient prediction of disease is a challenging task. The proposed model deploys a DL process with a multi-layered non-local Bayes (NL Bayes) model to manage the process of early diagnosis. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) could be useful in determining factors that could enable the effective sorting of quality values through the use of sensors and image processing techniques. We studied the proposed model by analyzing its results with regard to specific attributes such as accuracy, quality, and system process efficiency. In this study, we aimed to overcome problems in the existing process through the practical results of a computational comparison process. The proposed model provided a low error rate (2%, 5%) and an increase in the number of instance values. The experimental results led us to conclude that the proposed model can make predictions based on images with high sensitivity and better precision values compared to other specific results. The proposed model achieved the expected accuracy (81%, 95%), the expected specificity (80%, 98%), and the expected sensitivity (80%, 99%). This model is adequate for real-time health monitoring systems in the prediction of lung cancer and can enable effective decision-making with the use of DL techniques.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new Internet of Things (IoT) based predictive modelling by using fuzzy cluster based augmentation and classification for predicting the lung cancer disease through continuous monitoring and also to improve the healthcare by providing medical instructions. Here, the fuzzy clustering method is used and which is based on transition region extraction for effective image segmentation. Moreover, Fuzzy C-Means Clustering algorithm is used to categorize the transitional region features from the feature of lung cancer image. In this work, Otsu thresholding method is used for extracting the transition region from lung cancer image. Moreover, the right edge image and the morphological thinning operation are used for enhancing the performance of segmentation. In addition, the morphological cleaning and the image region filling operations are performed over an edge lung cancer image for getting the object regions. In addition, we also propose a new incremental classification algorithm which combines the existing Association Rule Mining (ARM), the standard Decision Tree (DT) with temporal features and the CNN. The experiments have been conducted by using the standard images that are collected from database and the current health data which are collected from patient through IoT devices. The results proved that the performance of the proposed prediction model which is able to achieve the better accuracy when it is compared with other existing prediction model.

AB  - Diabetes patients suffer from abnormal blood glucose levels, which can cause diverse health disorders that affect their kidneys, heart and vision. Due to these conditions, diabetes patients have traditionally checked blood glucose levels through Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) techniques, like pricking their fingers multiple times per day. Such techniques involve a number of drawbacks that can be solved by using a device called Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), which can measure blood glucose levels continuously throughout the day without having to prick the patient when carrying out every measurement. This article details the design and implementation of a system that enhances commercial CGMs by adding Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities to them that allow for monitoring patients remotely and, thus, warning them about potentially dangerous situations. The proposed system makes use of smartphones to collect blood glucose values from CGMs and then sends them either to a remote cloud or to distributed fog computing nodes. Moreover, in order to exchange reliable, trustworthy and cybersecure data with medical scientists, doctors and caretakers, the system includes the deployment of a decentralized storage system that receives, processes and stores the collected data. Furthermore, in order to motivate users to add new data to the system, an incentive system based on a digital cryptocurrency named GlucoCoin was devised. Such a system makes use of a blockchain that is able to execute smart contracts in order to automate CGM sensor purchases or to reward the users that contribute to the system by providing their own data. Thanks to all the previously mentioned technologies, the proposed system enables patient data crowdsourcing and the development of novel mobile health (mHealth) applications for diagnosing, monitoring, studying and taking public health actions that can help to advance in the control of the disease and raise global awareness on the increasing prevalence of diabetes.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has become a major technological development which offers smart infrastructure for the cloud-edge services by the interconnection of physical devices and virtual things among mobile applications and embedded devices. The e-healthcare application solely depends on the IoT and cloud computing environment, has provided several characteristics and applications. Prior research works reported that the energy consumption for transmission process is significantly higher compared to sensing and processing, which led to quick exhaustion of energy. In this view, this paper introduces a new energy efficient cluster enabled clinical decision support system (EEC-CDSS) for embedded IoT environment. The presented EECCDSS model aims to effectively transmit the medical data from IoT devices and perform accurate diagnostic process. The EEC-CDSS model incorporates particle swarm optimization with levy distribution (PSO-L) based clustering technique, which clusters the set of IoT devices and reduces the amount of data transmission. In addition, the IoT devices forward the data to the cloud where the actual classification procedure is performed. For classification process, variational autoencoder (VAE) is used to determine the existence of disease or not. In order to investigate the proficient results analysis of the EEC-CDSS model, a wide range of simulations was carried out on heart disease and diabetes dataset. The obtained simulation values pointed out the supremacy of the EEC-CDSS model interms of energy efficiency and classification accuracy.

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmia is a deadly disease that threatens the lives of millions of people, which shows the need for earlier detection and classification. An abnormal signal in the heart causing arrhythmia can be detected at an earlier stage when the health data from the patient are monitored using IoT technology. Arrhythmias may suddenly lead to death and the classification of arrhythmias is considered a complicated process. In this research, an effective classification model for the classification of heart disease is developed using flamingo optimization. Initially, the ECG signal from the heart is collected and then it is subjected to the preprocessing stage; to detect and control the electrical activity of the heart, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is used. The input signals collected using IoT nodes are collectively presented in the base station for the classification using flamingo-optimization-based deep convolutional networks, which effectively predict the disease. With the aid of communication technologies and the contribution of IoT, medical professionals can easily monitor the health condition of patients. The performance is analyzed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

AB  - Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is a non-invasive approach to measure the maximum oxygen uptake (V O2-max), which is an index to assess cardiovascular fitness (CF). However, CPET is not available to all populations and cannot be obtained continuously. Thus, wearable sensors are associated with machine learning (ML) algorithms to investigate CF. Therefore, this study aimed to predict CF by using ML algorithms using data obtained by wearable technologies. For this purpose, 43 volunteers with different levels of aerobic power, who wore a wearable device to collect unobtrusive data for 7 days, were evaluated by CPET. Eleven inputs (sex, age, weight, height, and body mass index, breathing rate, minute ventilation, total hip acceleration, walking cadence, heart rate, and tidal volume) were used to predict the V O(2-max)by support vector regression (SVR). Afterward, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was used to explain their results. SVR was able to predict the CF, and the SHAP method showed that the inputs related to hemodynamic and anthropometric domains were the most important ones to predict the CF. Therefore, we conclude that the cardiovascular fitness can be predicted by wearable technologies associated with machine learning during unsupervised activities of daily living.

AB  - Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) is a leading cause of death and is a worldwide disorder, despite significant progress in diagnosis over the past decade. AMI is a multifactorial disease that is thought to be due to the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. It requires a high degree of knowledge and experience together to predict acute myocardial infarction is a complicated task. Internet of things (IoT) technology, the Internet, the sensor value of the collection for the diagnosis, and prediction of heart disease, have been adopted in the current medical system. To resolve this problem, it has been proposed to evaluate acute myocardial infarction using a more accurate qualified Quick Decision Diagnosis (QDD) algorithm, the IoT of the framework. Smart wearable device and heart monitoring devices have been attached to the patient?s monitoring of blood pressure and Electrocardiogram (ECG). QDD is used to classify the sensor data with the received patient?s normal and abnormal data. The simulation results show that the QDD-based myocardial infarction prognosis system is better proposed than other methods offered.

AB  - People living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) require lifelong self-management to maintain glucose levels in a safe range. Failure to do so can lead to adverse glycemic events with short and long-term complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 +/- 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 +/- 0.07 and 0.70 +/- 0.05, respectively. The use of wristband data significantly reduced the RMSE by 2.25 mg/dL (p < 0.01). The well-trained model is implemented on the ARISES app to provide real-time decision support. These results indicate that the ARISES has great potential to mitigate the risk of severe complications and enhance self-management for people with T1D.

AB  - Because of the worldwide aging population, more and more elders suffer from dementia problem. Nowadays, it is an inconvenient and time-consuming process for medical doctors to diagnose elders who live independently with possible dementia because the process imposes a large quantity of diagnostic questions from a checklist that needs to be answered by elders themselves or their caregivers either directly or after a long-term observation. In order to help doctors to make this diagnostic process easier, this article proposes a supporting system that can quickly estimate the likelihood for an elder of having dementia based on 2 to 4 hours monitoring of a behavioral test done by the elder. During the test, the elder only needs to perform certain activities selected from the so-called instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in a smart home environment, and their movement trajectories will be extracted from motion sensors deployed in the smart home environment and be analyzed to find a potential correlation with the indoor wandering patterns. A machine learning algorithm is selected to carry out the classification task, namely, into dementia and nondementia groups, based on our proposed features of the aforementioned wandering patterns. Two data sets are employed for performance evaluation, where the first one is 232 elders including seven dementia, whereas the second one is collected by ourselves from a senior center, which is 30 elders including nine dementia. It turns out that the average precision and recall for the first data set are both up to 98.3% with area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) being 0.846, and those for the second data set are 89.9% and 90.0% with AUC-ROC being 0.921. Note to Practitioners-We proposed a supporting system which can classify the elders as either dementia or nondementia with high accuracy. The trajectories of the elders will be extracted from motion sensors that deployed in the smart home environment. The indoor wandering patterns according to repetitive movements are analyzed and classified using the machine learning technique. The proposed system used ambient sensors instead of wearable sensors or cameras to let the elders feel more comfortable when they are being monitored. In addition, the proposed system only required a short period of time to screen the elders and easier for medical doctors to diagnose the elders without wasting time for asking the large quantity of diagnostic questions from a checklist that needs to be answered by the elders themselves or their caregivers.

AB  - Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death worldwide. In the USA, there are approximately 0.8 million persons suffering from AMI annually with a death rate of 27%. The risk factors of AMI include hypertension, family history, smoking habits, diabetes, serenity, obesity, cholesterol, alcoholism, coronary artery disease, and so forth. In this study, data acquired from a subset of the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) of Taiwan were used to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to predict AMI. The integrated genetic algorithm and support vector machine (IGS) and deep neural network (DNN) were both applied to design the predictive models. A balanced dataset (6087 AMI patients and 6087 non-AMI patients) and an imbalanced dataset (6,087 AMI patients and 12,174 non-AMI patients) with each patient record including 74 features were retrieved to design the predictive models. Tenfold cross-validation was used to obtain the optimal model with best prediction performance during training. The experimental results showed that the CDSSs reached a prediction performance with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 79.75-84.4%, 68.29-83.7%, 82.45-92.07%, and 0.8424-0.9089, respectively, for models designed based on the balanced dataset, as well as 81.86-86.27%, 52.65-81.22%, 84.29-96.47%, and 0.8503-0.9098, respectively, for models implemented based on the imbalanced dataset. The IGS and DNN algorithms and a combination of age, presence of related comorbidities, and other comorbidity-related features, including diagnosed age and annual physician visits of individual comorbidities, have been shown to be promising in designing strong predictive models in detecting patients who are more likely to develop AMI in the near future as well as for realizing mobile-health (m-Health) systems in managing their comorbidities to prevent occurrence of AMI events. Future work will focus on realizing an ensemble model by combining the model designed based on the long-term NHIRD dataset and the model based on the short-term EMR data and the real-time IoT sensor data, as well as implementing a transfer learning model by transferring the knowledge learned from the long-term model for training the short-term model, so that the predictive performance can be enhanced.

AB  - Background: Body motion data registered by wearable sensors can provide objective feedback to patients on the effectiveness of the rehabilitation interventions they undergo. Such a feedback may motivate patients to keep increasing the amount of exercise they perform, thus facilitating their recovery during physical rehabilitation therapy. In this work, we propose a novel wearable and affordable system which can predict different postures of the upper-extremities by classifying force myographic (FMG) signals of the forearm in real-time.
   Methods: An easy to use force sensor resistor (FSR) strap to extract the upper-extremities FMG signals was prototyped. The FSR strap was designed to be placed on the proximal portion of the forearm and capture the activities of the main muscle groups with eight force input channels. The non-kernel based extreme learning machine (ELM) classifier with sigmoid based function was implemented for real-time classification due to its fast learning characteristics. A test protocol was designed to classify in real-time six upper-extremities postures that are needed to successfully complete a drinking task, which is a functional exercise often used in constraint-induced movement therapy. Six healthy volunteers participated in the test. Each participant repeated the drinking task three times. FMG data and classification results were recorded for analysis.
   Results: The obtained results confirmed that the FMG data captured from the FSR strap produced distinct patterns for the selected upper-extremities postures of the drinking task. With the use of the non-kernel based ELM, the postures associated to the drinking task were predicted in real-time with an average overall accuracy of 92.33% and standard deviation of 3.19%.
   Conclusions: This study showed that the proposed wearable FSR strap was able to detect eight FMG signals from the forearm. In addition, the implemented ELM algorithm was able to correctly classify in real-time six postures associated to the drinking task. The obtained results therefore point out that the proposed system has potential for providing instant feedback during functional rehabilitation exercises.

AB  - Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) are a major cause of cardiovascular disease and death in Europe. Sudden cardiac death accounts for 50% of cardiac mortality in developed countries; ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation is the most common underlying arrhythmia. In the ambulatory population, atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with an increased risk of stroke and heart failure, particularly in an aging population. Early detection of arrhythmias allows appropriate intervention, reducing disability and death. However, in the early stages of disease arrhythmias may be transient, lasting only a few seconds, and are thus difficult to detect. This work addresses the problem of extracting the far-field heart electrogram signal from noise components, as recorded in bipolar leads along the left arm, using a data driven ECG (electrocardiogram) denoising algorithm based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) methods to enable continuous non-invasive monitoring of heart rhythm for long periods of time using a wrist or arm wearable device with advanced biopotential sensors. Performance assessment against a control denoising method of signal averaging (SA) was implemented in a pilot study with 34 clinical cases. EEMD was found to be a reliable, low latency, data-driven denoising technique with respect to the control SA method, achieving signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement to a standard closer to the SA control method, particularly on the upper arm-ECG bipolar leads. Furthermore, the SNR performance of the EEMD was improved when assisted with an FFT (fast Fourier transform ) thresholding algorithm (EEMD-fft).

AB  - Nowadays, wearable sensors play a vital role in the detection of human motions, innovating an alternate and intuitive form in human-computer interaction (HCI). In this study, we present a novel real-time wearable system for finger air-writing recognition in three-dimensional (3D) space based on the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense as an edge device, which can run TensorFlow Lite to realize recognition and classification on the device. This system enables users to have the freedom and flexibility to write characters (10 digits and 26 English lower-case letters) in free space by moving fingers and uses a deep learning algorithm to recognize 36 characters from the motion data captured by inertial measurement units (IMUs) and processed by a microcontroller, which are both embedded in an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense. We prepared 63000 air-writing stroke data samples of 35 subjects containing 18 males and 17 females for convolutional neural network (CNN) training and achieved a high recognition accuracy at 97.95%.

AB  - The absence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) diagnostic and management solutions cause significant morbidity among populations in rural areas and the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) emergency. To tackle this problem, in this paper, the development of an Internet of things (IoT) assisted ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system is presented. The system's wearable single-channel data acquisition device supports 25 h of continuous operation. A right leg drive (RLD) circuit supported analog frontend (AFE) with a high common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 121 dB and a digitally implemented notch filter is used to suppress power-line frequency interference. The wearable device continuously sends the collected ECG data via Bluetooth to the user's smartphone. An application on the user's smartphone renders real-time ECG trace and heart rate and detects abnormal heart rhythms. This data are then shared in real-time with the user's doctor via a real-time cloud database. An application on the doctor's smartphone allows real-time visualization of this data and detection of arrhythmias. Simulations and experimental results demonstrate that reliable ECG signals can be captured with low latency and the heart rate computation is comparable to a commercial application. Low cost, scalability, low latency, real-time ECG monitoring, and improved performance of the system make the system highly suitable for the real-time remote identification and management of CVDs in users of rural areas and in the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) provides smart solutions for future urban communities to address key benefits with the least human intercession. A smart home offers the necessary capabilities to promote efficiency and sustainability to a resident with their healthcare-related, social, and emotional needs. In particular, it provides an opportunity to assess the functional health ability of the elderly or individuals with cognitive impairment in performing daily life activities. This work proposes an approach named Cognitive Assessment of Smart Home Resident (CA-SHR) to measure the ability of smart home residents in executing simple to complex activities of daily living using pre-defined scores assigned by a neuropsychologist. CA-SHR also measures the quality of tasks performed by the participants using supervised classification. Furthermore, CA-SHR provides a temporal feature analysis to estimate if the temporal features help to detect impaired individuals effectively. The goal of this study is to detect cognitively impaired individuals in their early stages. CA-SHR assess the health condition of individuals through significant features and improving the representation of dementia patients. For the classification of individuals into healthy, Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI), and dementia categories, we use ensemble AdaBoost. This results in improving the reliability of the CA-SHR through the correct assignment of labels to the smart home resident compared with existing techniques.

AB  - Proper stroke posture and rhythm are crucial for kayakers to achieve perfect performance and avoid the occurrence of sport injuries. The traditional video-based analysis method has numerous limitations (e.g., site and occlusion). In this study, we propose a systematic approach for evaluating the training performance of kayakers based on the multiple sensors fusion technology. Kayakers' motion information is collected by miniature inertial sensor nodes attached on the body. The extend Kalman filter (EKF) method is used for data fusion and updating human posture. After sensor calibration, the kayakers' actions are reconstructed by rigid-body model. The quantitative kinematic analysis is carried out based on joint angles. Machine learning algorithms are used for differentiating the stroke cycle into different phases, including entry, pull, exit and recovery. The experiment shows that our method can provide comprehensive motion evaluation information under real on-water scenario, and the phase identification of kayaker's motions is up to 98% validated by videography method. The proposed approach can provide quantitative information for coaches and athletes, which can be used to improve the training effects.

AB  - Background/ObjectivesCAN-THUMBS UP is designed as a comprehensive and innovative fully remote program to 1) develop an interactive and compelling online Brain Health Support Program intervention, with potential to positively influence dementia literacy, self-efficacy and lifestyle risk factors; 2) enroll and retain a community-dwelling Platform Trial Cohort of individuals at risk of dementia who will participate in the intervention; 3) support an open platform trial to test a variety of multidomain interventions that might further benefit individuals at risk of dementia. This manuscript presents the Brain Health Support Program Study protocol.Design/SettingTwelve-month prospective multi-center longitudinal study to evaluate a fully remote web-based educational intervention. Participants will subsequently be part of a Platform Trial Cohort and may be eligible to participate in further dementia prevention clinical trials.ParticipantsThree hundred fifty older adults who are cognitively unimpaired or have mild cognitive impairment, with at least 1 well established dementia risk factor.InterventionParticipants engage in the Brain Health Support Program intervention for 45-weeks and complete pre/post intervention measures. This intervention is designed to convey best available evidence for dementia prevention, consists of 181 chapters within 8 modules that are progressively delivered, and is available online in English and French. The program has been developed as a collaborative effort by investigators with recognized expertise in the program's content areas, along with input from older-adult citizen advisors.MeasurementsThis study utilizes adapted remote assessments with accessible technologies (e.g. videoconferencing, cognitive testing via computer and mobile phone, wearable devices to track physical activity and sleep, self-administered saliva sample collection). The primary outcome is change in dementia literacy, as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale. Secondary outcomes include change in self-efficacy; engagement using the online program; user satisfaction ratings; and evaluation of usability and acceptance. Exploratory outcomes include changes in attitudes toward dementia, modifiable risk factors, performance on the Neuropsychological Test Battery, performance on self-administered online cognitive assessments, and levels of physical activity and sleep; success of the national recruitment plan; and the distribution of age adjusted polygenic hazard scores.ConclusionsThis fully remote study provides an accessible approach to research with all study activities being completed in the participants' home environment.

AB  - Clinical rehabilitation assessment is an important part of the therapy process because it is the premise for prescribing suitable rehabilitation interventions. However, the commonly used assessment scales have the following two drawbacks: (1) they are susceptible to subjective factors; (2) they only have several rating levels and are influenced by a ceiling effect, making it impossible to exactly detect any further improvement in the movement. Meanwhile, energy constraints are a primary design consideration in wearable sensor network systems since they are often battery-operated. Traditionally, for wearable sensor network systems that follow the Shannon/Nyquist sampling theorem, there are many data that need to be sampled and transmitted. This paper proposes a novel wearable sensor network system to monitor and quantitatively assess the upper limb motion function, based on compressed sensing technology. With the sparse representation model, less data is transmitted to the computer than with traditional systems. The experimental results show that the accelerometer signals of Bobath handshake and shoulder touch exercises can be compressed, and the length of the compressed signal is less than 1/3 of the raw signal length. More importantly, the reconstruction errors have no influence on the predictive accuracy of the Brunnstrom stage classification model. It also indicated that the proposed system can not only reduce the amount of data during the sampling and transmission processes, but also, the reconstructed accelerometer signals can be used for quantitative assessment without any loss of useful information.

AB  - Heart disease and stroke are becoming the leading causes of death worldwide. Electrocardiography monitoring devices (ECG) are the only tool that helps physicians diagnose cardiac abnormalities. Although the design of ECGs has followed closely the electronics miniaturization evolution over the years, existing wearable ECGs have limited accuracy and rely on external resources to analyze the signals and evaluate heart activity. In this paper, we work towards empowering the wearable device with processing capabilities to locally analyze the signal and identify abnormal behaviour. The ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal heart activity significantly reduces (a) the need to store the signals, (b) the data transmitted to the cloud, (c) the overall power consumption and (d) the confidentiality of private data. Based on this concept, the HEART system presented in this work combines wearable embedded devices, mobile edge devices, and cloud services to provide on-the-spot, reliable, accurate, and instant heart monitoring. The wearable device is remotely trained by a physician to learn to accurately identify critical events related to each particular patient. Following this training session, the wearable device becomes capable of interpreting a large number of heart abnormalities without relying on cloud services and edge resources, when the medical doctor is not present. The Fog computing approach extends the cloud computing paradigm by migrating data-processing closer to the production site, thus accelerating the system's responsiveness to events. The HEART system's performance concerning the accuracy of detecting abnormal events and the power consumption of the wearable device is evaluated. Results indicate that a very high success rate can be achieved in terms of event detection ratio and the battery is able to sustain operation up to a full week without the need for a recharge.

AB  - Telemedicine and all types of monitoring systems have proven to be a useful and low-cost tool with a high level of applicability in cardiology. The objective of this work is to present an IoT-based monitoring system for cardiovascular patients. The system sends the ECG signal to a Fog layer service by using the LoRa communication protocol. Also, it includes an AI algorithm based on deep learning for the detection of Atrial Fibrillation and other heart rhythms. The automatic detection of arrhythmias can be complementary to the diagnosis made by the physician, achieving a better clinical vision that improves therapeutic decision making. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated on a dataset of 8.528 short single-lead ECG records using two merge MobileNet networks that classify data with an accuracy of 90% for atrial fibrillation.

AB  - Background and Aim: A healthy body composition can improve the prognosis of breast cancer survivors. The study aimed to describe the body composition profile of breast cancer survivors and find out whether a short-term (3 months) wearable device-based lifestyle intervention had an effect on patients' body weight and body composition.
   Methods: A before-and-after study was conducted on patients with stage I-III postoperative breast cancer, aged 18-70 years. Body composition was analyzed at baseline, and then patients went for a health education program. A wearable activity tracker and a goal of calorie consumption based on each individual's weight were provided to each participant, and they were required to be equipped for 90 days. After 3 months, body composition was analyzed again.
   Results: Of 113 patients who completed the study, 65.49% showed a normal body mass index (BMI) at baseline assessment, 71.68% had a body fat percentage of more than 30%, and 41.59% had less skeleton muscle mass. During the intervention, the daily step count was 8,851.28 +/- 2,399.31, and 59.21% reached the set goal calorie consumption. After a 3-month intervention, the patients had a significant reduction in body weight, fat mass, BMI, body fat percentage, and visceral fat area, but not in protein mass and skeleton muscle mass. Patients of different age, molecular classification, and therapy benefited from the intervention.
   Conclusion: Wearable technology with body composition analysis and health education for breast cancer survivors may help reduce weight and improve body composition even in a short time.

AB  - Cloud computing delivers services through the Internet and enables the deployment of a diversity of apps to provide services to many businesses. At present, the low scalability of these cloud frameworks is their primary obstacle. As a result, they are unable to satisfy the demands of centralized computer systems, which are based on the Internet of Things (IoT). Applications such as disease surveillance and tracking and monitoring systems, which are highly latency sensitive, demand the computation of the Big Data communicated to centralized databases and from databases to cloud data centers, resulting in system performance loss. Recent concepts, such as fog and edge computing, offer novel approaches to data processing by relocating the processing power and other resources closer to the end user, thereby reducing latency and maximizing energy efficiency. Existing fog models, on the other hand, have a number of limitations and tend to prioritize either the precision of their findings or a faster response time, but not both. For the purpose of applying a healthcare solution in the real world, we developed and implemented a one-of-a-kind architecture that integrates quartet deep learning with edge computing devices. The paradigm that has been developed delivers health management as a fog service through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and efficiently organizes the data from patients based on the requirements of the user. FogBus, a fog-enabled cloud framework, is used to measure the effectiveness of the proposed structure in regards to resource usage, network throughput, congestion, precision, and runtime. To maximize the QoS or forecast the accuracy in different fog computing settings and for different user requirements, the suggested technique can be set up to run in a number of different modes.

AB  - Background: The most common breast cancer detection modalities are generally limited by radiation exposure, discomfort, high costs, inter-observer variabilities in image interpretation, and low sensitivity in detecting cancer in dense breast tissue. Therefore, there is a clear need for an affordable and effective adjunct modality that can address these limitations. The Cyrcadia Breast Monitor (CBM) is a non-invasive, non-compressive, and non-radiogenic wearable device developed as an adjunct to current modalities to assist in the detection of breast tissue abnormalities in any type of breast tissue.
   Methods: The CBM records thermodynamic metabolic data from the breast skin surface over a period of time using two wearable biometric patches consisting of eight sensors each and a data recording device. The acquired multi-dimensional temperature time series data are analyzed to determine the presence of breast tissue abnormalities. The objective of this paper is to present the scientific background of CBM and also to describe the history around the design and development of the technology.
   Results: The results of using the CBM device in the initial clinical studies are also presented. Twenty four-hour long breast skin temperature circadian rhythm data was collected from 93 benign and 108 malignant female study subjects in the initial clinical studies. The predictive model developed using these datasets could differentiate benign and malignant lesions with 78% accuracy, 83.6% sensitivity and 71.5% specificity. A pilot study of 173 female study subjects is underway, in order to validate this predictive model in an independent test population.
   Conclusions: The results from the initial studies indicate that the CBM may be valuable for breast health monitoring under physician supervision for confirmation of any abnormal changes, potentially prior to other methods, such as, biopsies. Studies are being conducted and planned to validate the technology and also to evaluate its ability as an adjunct breast health monitoring device for identifying abnormalities in difficult-to-diagnose dense breast tissue.

AB  - Background: Changes in autonomic nervous system function, characterized by heart rate variability (HRV), have been associated with infection and observed prior to its clinical identification.
   Objective: We performed an evaluation of HRV collected by a wearable device to identify and predict COVID-19 and its related symptoms.
   Methods: Health care workers in the Mount Sinai Health System were prospectively followed in an ongoing observational study using the custom Warrior Watch Study app, which was downloaded to their smartphones. Participants wore an Apple Watch for the duration of the study, measuring HRV throughout the follow-up period. Surveys assessing infection and symptom-related questions were obtained daily.
   Results: Using a mixed-effect cosinor model, the mean amplitude of the circadian pattern of the standard deviation of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, differed between subjects with and without COVID-19 (P=.006). The mean amplitude of this circadian pattern differed between individuals during the 7 days before and the 7 days after a COVID-19 diagnosis compared to this metric during uninfected time periods (P=.01). Significant changes in the mean and amplitude of the circadian pattern of the SDNN was observed between the first day of reporting a COVID-19-related symptom compared to all other symptom-free days (P=.01).
   Conclusions: Longitudinally collected HRV metrics from a commonly worn commercial wearable device (Apple Watch) can predict the diagnosis of COVID-19 and identify COVID-19-related symptoms. Prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasal swab polymerase chain reaction testing, significant changes in HRV were observed, demonstrating the predictive ability of this metric to identify COVID-19 infection.

AB  - Gait is emerging as a potential diagnostic tool for cognitive decline. The 'Deep and Frequent Phenotyping for Experimental Medicine in Dementia Study' (D& FP) is a multicenter feasibility study embedded in the United Kingdom Dementia Platform designed to determine participant acceptability and feasibility of extensive and repeated phenotyping to determine the optimal combination of biomarkers to detect disease progression and identify early risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Gait is included as a clinical biomarker. The tools to quantify gait in the clinic and home, and suitability for multicenter application have not been examined. Six centers from the National Institute for Health Research Translational Research Collaboration in Dementia initiative recruited 20 individuals with early onset AD. Participants wore a single wearable (tri-axial accelerometer) and completed both clinic-based and free-living gait assessment. A series of macro (behavioral) and micro (spatiotemporal) characteristics were derived from the resultant data using previously validated algorithms. Results indicate good participant acceptability, and potential for use of body-worn sensors in both the clinic and the home. Recommendations for future studies have been provided. Gait has been demonstrated to be a feasible and suitable measure, and future research should examine its suitability as a biomarker in AD.

AB  - Background: Circadian and multiday rhythms are found across many biological systems, including cardiology, endocrinology, neurology, and immunology. In people with epilepsy, epileptic brain activity and seizure occurrence have been found to follow circadian, weekly, and monthly rhythms. Understanding the relationship between these cycles of brain excitability and other physiological systems can provide new insight into the causes of multiday cycles. The brain-heart link has previously been considered in epilepsy research, with potential implications for seizure forecasting, therapy, and mortality (i.e., sudden unexpected death in epilepsy).
   Methods: We report the results from a non-interventional, observational cohort study, Tracking Seizure Cycles. This study sought to examine multiday cycles of heart rate and seizures in adults with diagnosed uncontrolled epilepsy (N=31) and healthy adult controls (N=15) using wearable smartwatches and mobile seizure diaries over at least four months (M=12.0, SD=5.9; control M=10.6, SD=6.4). Cycles in heart rate were detected using a continuous wavelet transform. Relationships between heart rate cycles and seizure occurrence were measured from the distributions of seizure likelihood with respect to underlying cycle phase.
   Findings: Heart rate cycles were found in all 46 participants (people with epilepsy and healthy controls), with circadian (N=46), about-weekly (N=25) and about-monthly (N=13) rhythms being the most prevalent. Of the participants with epilepsy, 19 people had at least 20 reported seizures, and 10 of these had seizures significantly phase locked to their multiday heart rate cycles.
   Interpretation: Heart rate cycles showed similarities to multiday epileptic rhythms and may be comodulated with seizure likelihood. The relationship between heart rate and seizures is relevant for epilepsy therapy, including seizure forecasting, and may also have implications for cardiovascular disease. More broadly, understanding the link between multiday cycles in the heart and brain can shed new light on endogenous physiological rhythms in humans. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper proposed integrating the communication system on the garment, which can be utilized to detect breast cancer at an early stage by using an ultra-wideband (UWB) wearable antenna. Breast cancer is an abnormal cell that is located in the breast tissue. Early detection of breast cancer plays an important role, and it helps in the long term for all women. The proposed UWB wearable antenna successfully operates at 3.1-10.6 GHz under an acceptable reflection coefficient of -10 dB. The fabricated wearable antenna was made from Shieldit Super and felt both conductive and nonconductive wearable materials. Few measurement studies of bending angles have been carried out that covered 2 degrees, 4 degrees, 6 degrees, 8 degrees, and 10 degrees. In addition, the performance of UWB antennas in wet environments is studied in four stages: in water, instantly wet, nearly dry, and entirely dry. There is good agreement between the measured and simulated outcomes. Based on the experimental results, the proposed antenna could be helpful for a home breast cancer detection system.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been made simple in recent years, thanks to recent advancements made in Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. These techniques are applied in several areas like security, surveillance, healthcare, human-robot interaction, and entertainment. Since wearable sensorbased HAR system includes in-built sensors, human activities can be categorized based on sensor values. Further, it can also be employed in other applications such as gait diagnosis, observation of children/adult's cognitive nature, stroke-patient hospital direction, Epilepsy and Parkinson's disease examination, etc. Recently-developed Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, especially Deep Learning (DL) models can be deployed to accomplish effective outcomes on HAR process. With this motivation, the current research paper focuses on designing Intelligent Hyperparameter Tuned Deep Learning-based HAR (IHPTDL-HAR) technique in healthcare environment. The proposed IHPTDL-HAR technique aims at recognizing the human actions in healthcare environment and helps the patients in managing their healthcare service. In addition, the presented model makes use of Hierarchical Clustering (HC)-based outlier detection technique to remove the outliers. IHPTDL-HAR technique incorporates DL-based Deep Belief Network (DBN) model to recognize the activities of users. Moreover, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is used for hyperparameter tuning of DBN model. Finally, a comprehensive experimental analysis was conducted upon benchmark dataset and the results were examined under different aspects. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IHPTDL-HAR technique is a superior performer compared to other recent techniques under different measures.

AB  - Identifying the foot stance and foot swing phases, also known as foot-to-ground (FTG) detection, is a branch of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Our study aims to detect two main phases of the gait (i.e., foot-off and foot-contact) corresponding to the moments when each foot is in contact with the ground or not. This will allow the medical professionals to characterize and identify the different phases of the human gait and their respective patterns. This detection process is paramount for extracting gait features (e.g., step width, stride width, gait speed, cadence, etc.) used by medical experts to highlight gait anomalies, stance issues, or any other walking irregularities. It will be used to assist health practitioners with patient monitoring, in addition to developing a full pipeline for FTG detection that would help compute gait indicators. In this paper, a comparison of different training configurations, including model architectures, data formatting, and pre-processing, was conducted to select the parameters leading to the highest detection accuracy. This binary classification provides a label for each timestamp informing whether the foot is in contact with the ground or not. Models such as CNN, LSTM, and ConvLSTM were the best fits for this study. Yet, we did not exclude DNNs and Machine Learning models, such as Random Forest and XGBoost from our work in order to have a wide range of possible comparisons. As a result of our experiments, which included 27 senior participants who had a stroke in the past wearing IMU sensors on their ankles, the ConvLSTM model achieved a high accuracy of 97.01% for raw windowed data with a size of 3 frames per window, and each window was formatted to have two superimposed channels (accelerometer and gyroscope channels). The model was trained to have the best detection without any knowledge of the participants' personal information including age, gender, health condition, the type of activity, or the used foot. In other words, the model's input data only originated from IMU sensors. Overall, in terms of FTG detection, the combination of the ConvLSTM model and the data representation had an important impact in outperforming other start-of-the-art configurations; in addition, the compromise between the model's complexity and its accuracy is a major asset for deploying this model and developing real-time solutions.

AB  - The large number of poststroke recovery patients poses a burden on rehabilitation centers, hospitals, and physiotherapists. The advent of rehabilitation robotics and automated assessment systems can ease this burden by assisting in the rehabilitation of patients with a high level of recovery. This assistance will enable medical professionals to either better provide for patients with severe injuries or treat more patients. It also translates into financial assistance as well in the long run. This paper demonstrated an automated assessment system for in-home rehabilitation utilizing a data glove, a mobile application, and machine learning algorithms. The system can be used by poststroke patients with a high level of recovery to assess their performance. Furthermore, this assessment can be sent to a medical professional for supervision. Additionally, a comparison between two machine learning classifiers was performed on their assessment of physical exercises. The proposed system has an accuracy of 85% (+/- 5.1%) with careful feature and classifier selection.

AB  - As is known, cerebral stroke has become one of the main diseases endangering people's health; ischaemic strokes accounts for approximately 85% of cerebral strokes. According to research, early prediction and prevention can effectively reduce the incidence rate of the disease. However, it is difficult to predict the ischaemic stroke because the data related to the disease are multi-modal. To achieve high accuracy of prediction and combine the stroke risk predictors obtained by previous researchers, a method for predicting the probability of stroke occurrence based on a multi-model fusion convolutional neural network structure is proposed. In such a way, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction is improved by processing multi-modal data through multiple end-to-end neural networks. In this method, the feature extraction of structured data (age, gender, history of hypertension, etc.) and streaming data (heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) based on a convolutional neural network is first realized. A neural network model for feature fusion is then constructed to realize the feature fusion of structured data and streaming data. Finally, a predictive model for predicting the probability of stroke is obtained by training. As shown in the experimental results, the accuracy of ischaemic stroke prediction reached 98.53%. Such a high prediction accuracy will be helpful for preventing the occurrence of stroke.

AB  - Infectious diseases remain a common problem in low- and middle-income countries, including in Vietnam. Tetanus is a severe infectious disease characterized by muscle spasms and complicated by autonomic nervous system dysfunction in severe cases. Patients require careful monitoring using electrocardiograms (ECGs) to detect deterioration and the onset of autonomic nervous system dysfunction as early as possible. Machine learning analysis of ECG has been shown of extra value in predicting tetanus severity, however any additional ECG signal analysis places a high demand on time-limited hospital staff and requires specialist equipment. Therefore, we present a novel approach to tetanus monitoring from low-cost wearable sensors combined with a deep-learning-based automatic severity detection. This approach can automatically triage tetanus patients and reduce the burden on hospital staff. In this study, we propose a two-dimensional (2D) convolutional neural network with a channel-wise attention mechanism for the binary classification of ECG signals. According to the Ablett classification of tetanus severity, we define grades 1 and 2 as mild tetanus and grades 3 and 4 as severe tetanus.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) boom has revolutionized almost every corner of people's daily lives: healthcare, environment, transportation, manufacturing, supply chain, and so on. With the recent development of sensor and communication technology, IoT artifacts, including smart wearables, cameras, smartwatches, and autonomous systems can accurately measure and perceive their surrounding environment. Continuous sensing generates massive amounts of data and presents challenges for machine learning. Deep learning models (e.g., convolution neural networks and recurrent neural networks) have been extensively employed in solving IoT tasks by learning patterns from multi-modal sensory data. Graph neural networks (GNNs), an emerging and fast-growing family of neural network models, can capture complex interactions within sensor topology and have been demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art results in numerous IoT learning tasks. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in the application of GNNs to the IoT field, including a deep dive analysis of GNN design in various IoT sensing environments, an overarching list of public data and source codes from the collected publications, and future research directions. To keep track of newly published works, we collect representative papers and their open-source implementations and create a Github repository at GNN4IoT.

AB  - Stress is an inherent part of the normal human experience. Although, for the most part, this stress response is advantageous, chronic, heightened, or inappropriate stress responses can have deleterious effects on the human body. It has been suggested that individuals who experience repeated or prolonged stress exhibit blunted biological stress responses when compared to the general population. Thus, when assessing whether a ubiquitous stress response exists, it is important to stratify based on resting levels in the absence of stress. Research has shown that stress that causes symptomatic responses requires early intervention in order to mitigate possible associated mental health decline and personal risks. Given this, real-time monitoring of stress may provide immediate biofeedback to the individual and allow for early self-intervention. This study aimed to determine if the change in heart rate variability could predict, in two different cohorts, the quality of response to acute stress when exposed to an acute stressor and, in turn, contribute to the development of a physiological algorithm for stress which could be utilized in future smartwatch technologies. This study also aimed to assess whether baseline stress levels may affect the changes seen in heart rate variability at baseline and following stress tasks. A total of 30 student doctor participants and 30 participants from the general population were recruited for the study. The Trier Stress Test was utilized to induce stress, with resting and stress phase ECGs recorded, as well as inter-second heart rate (recorded using a FitBit). Although the present study failed to identify ubiquitous patterns of HRV and HR changes during stress, it did identify novel changes in these parameters between resting and stress states. This study has shown that the utilization of HRV as a measure of stress should be calculated with consideration of resting (baseline) anxiety and stress states in order to ensure an accurate measure of the effects of additive acute stress.

AB  - Feature selection is a primary exercise to tackle any forecasting task. Machine learning algorithms used to predict any variable can improve their performance by lessening their computational effort with a proper dataset. Anticipating future glycemia in type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) patients provides a baseline in its management, and in this task, we need to carefully select data, especially now, when novel wearable devices offer more and more information. In this paper, a complete characterization of 25 diabetic people has been carried out, registering innovative variables like sleep, schedule, or heart rate in addition to other well-known ones like insulin, meal, and exercise. With this ground-breaking data compilation, we present a study of these features using the Sequential Input Selection Algorithm (SISAL), which is specially prepared for time series data. The results rank features according to their importance, regarding their relevance in blood glucose level prediction as well as indicating the most influential past values to be taken into account and distinguishing features with person-dependent behavior from others with a common performance in any patient. These ideas can be used as strategies to select data for predicting glycemia depending on the availability of computational power, required speed, or required accuracy. In conclusion, this paper tries to analyze if there exists symmetry among the different features that can affect blood glucose levels, that is, if their behavior is symmetric in terms of influence in glycemia.

AB  - Aging contributes to the progression of vascular dysfunction and is a major nonreversible risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using arterial pulse-wave measurements, frequency-domain pulse analysis, and machine-learning analysis in distinguishing vascular aging.
   Radial pulse signals were measured noninvasively for 3 min in 280 subjects aged 40-80 years. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was used to evaluate the arterial stiffness of the subjects. Forty frequency-domain pulse indices were used as features, comprising amplitude proportion (C-n), coefficient of variation of C-n, phase angle (P-n), and standard deviation of P-n (n = 1-10). Multilayer perceptron and random forest with supervised learning were used to classify the data.
   The detected differences were more prominent in the subjects aged 40-50 years. Several indices differed significantly between the non-vascular-aging group (aged 40-50 years; CAVI <9) and the vascular-aging group (aged 70-80 years). Fivefold cross-validation revealed an excellent ability to discriminate the two groups (the accuracy was >80%, and the AUC was >0.8). For subjects aged 50-60 and 60-70 years, the detection accuracies of the two trained algorithms were around 80%, with AUCs of >0.73 for both, which indicated acceptable discrimination.
   The present method of frequency-domain analysis may improve the index reliability for further machine-learning analyses of the pulse waveform. The present noninvasive and objective methodology may be meaningful for developing a wearable-device system to reduce the threat of vascular dysfunction induced by vascular aging.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been studied as a potential diagnostic method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathological progression of AD leads to cortical disconnection. These disconnections may manifest as functional connectivity alterations, measured by the degree of synchronization between different brain regions, and alterations in complex behaviors produced by the interaction among wide-spread brain regions. Recently, machine learning methods, such as clustering algorithms and classification methods, have been adopted to detect disease-related changes in functional connectivity and classify the features of these changes. Although complexity of EEG signals can also reflect AD-related changes, few machine learning studies have focused on the changes in complexity. Therefore, in this study, we compared the ability of EEG signals to detect characteristics of AD using different machine learning approaches one focused on functional connectivity and the other focused on signal complexity. We examined functional connectivity, estimated by phase lag index (PLI) in EEG signals in healthy older participants [healthy control (HC)] and patients with AD. We estimated signal complexity using multi-scale entropy. Utilizing a support vector machine, we compared the identification accuracy of AD based on functional connectivity at each frequency band and complexity component. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between synchronization and complexity. The identification accuracy of functional connectivity of the alpha, beta, and gamma bands was significantly high (AUC 1.0), and the identification accuracy of complexity was sufficiently high (AUC 0.81). Moreover, the relationship between functional connectivity and complexity exhibited various temporal-scale-and-regional-specific dependency in both HC participants and patients with AD. In conclusion, the combination of functional connectivity and complexity might reflect complex pathological process of AD. Applying a combination of both machine learning methods to neurophysiological data may provide a novel understanding of the neural network processes in both healthy brains and pathological conditions.

AB  - The need to remotely monitor people with disabilities has increased due to growth in their number in recent years. The democratization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices facilitates the implementation of healthcare-monitoring systems (HMSs) that are capable of supporting disabilities and diseases. However, to achieve their full potential, these devices must efficiently address the customization demanded by different IoT HMS scenarios. This work introduces a new approach, called Modeling Scenarios of Internet of Things (MoSIoT), which allows healthcare experts to model and simulate IoT HMS scenarios defined for different disabilities and diseases. MoSIoT comprises a set of models based on the model-driven engineering (MDE) paradigm, which first allows simulation of a complete IoT HMS scenario, followed by generation of a final IoT system. In the current study, we used a real scenario defined by a recognized medical publication for a patient with Alzheimer's disease to validate this proposal. Furthermore, we present an implementation based on an enterprise cloud architecture that provides the simulation data to a commercial IoT hub, such as Azure IoT Central.

AB  - Reliable human activity recognition with wearable devices enables the development of human-centric pervasive applications. We aim to develop a robust wearable-based activity recognition system for real life situations where the device position is up to the user or where a user is unable to collect initial training data. Consequently, in this work we focus on the problem of recognizing the on-body position of the wearable device ensued by comprehensive experiments concerning subject-specific and cross-subjects activity recognition approaches that rely on acceleration data. We introduce a device localization method that predicts the on-body position with an F-measure of 89% and a cross-subjects activity recognition approach that considers common physical characteristics. In this context, we present a real world data set that has been collected from 15 participants for 8 common activities where they carried 7 wearable devices in different on-body positions. Our results show that the detection of the device position consistently improves the result of activity recognition for common activities. Regarding cross-subjects models, we identified the waist as the most suitable device location at which the acceleration patterns for the same activity across several people are most similar. In this context, our results provide evidence for the reliability of physical characteristics based cross-subjects models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Moreover, due to the unavailability of modernized healthcare-related technology, nursing and diagnosis facilities are limited for rural people. Therefore, rural people are deprived of proper healthcare. In this perspective, modern technology can be facilitated to mitigate their health problems. ECG sensing tools are interfaced with the human chest, and requisite cardiovascular data is collected through an IoT device. These data are stored in the cloud incorporates with the MQTT and HTTP servers. An innovative IoT-based method for ECG monitoring systems on cardiovascular or heart patients has been suggested in this study. The ECG signal parameters P, Q, R, S, T are collected, preprocessed, and predicted to monitor the cardiovascular conditions for further health management. The machine learning algorithm is used to determine the significance of ECG signal parameters and error rate. The logistic regression model fitted the better agreements between the train and test data. The prediction has been performed to determine the variation of PQRST quality and its suitability in the ECG Monitoring System. Considering the values of quality parameters, satisfactory results are obtained. The proposed IoT-based ECG system reduces the health care cost and complexity of cardiovascular diseases in the future.

AB  - Objective: Movement impairments such as those due to stroke often result in the nervous system adopting atypical movements to compensate for movement deficits. Monitoring these compensatory patterns is critical for improving functional outcomes during rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility and validity of a wearable sensor system for detecting compensatory trunk kinematics during activities of daily living. Approach: Participants with no history of neurological impairments performed reaching and manipulation tasks with their upper extremity, and their movements were recorded by a wearable sensor system and validated using a motion capture system. Compensatory movements of the trunk were induced using a brace that limited range of motion at the elbow. Main results: Our results showed that the elbow brace elicited compensatory movements of the trunk during reaching tasks but not manipulation tasks, and that a wearable sensor system with two sensors could reliably classify compensatory movements (similar to 90% accuracy). Significance: These results show the potential of the wearable system to assess and monitor compensatory movements outside of a lab setting.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.

AB  - Background: A novel, wireless, ultrasound biosensor that adheres to the neck and measures real-time Doppler of the carotid artery may be a useful functional hemodynamic monitor. A unique experimental set-up during elective coronary artery bypass surgery is described as a means to compare the wearable Doppler to trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE). Methods: A total of two representative patients were studied at baseline and during Trendelenburg position. Carotid Doppler spectra from the wearable ultrasound and TEE were synchronously captured. Areas under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) were performed to assess the accuracy of changing common carotid artery velocity time integral (ccVTI( increment )) at detecting a clinically significant change in stroke volume (SV increment ). Results: Synchronously measuring and comparing Doppler spectra from the wearable ultrasound and TEE is feasible during Trendelenburg positioning. In two representative cardiac surgical patients, the ccVTI( increment ) accurately detected a clinically significant SV increment  with AUROCs of 0.89, 0.91, and 0.95 when single-beat, 3-consecutive beat and 10-consecutive beat averages were assessed, respectively. Conclusion: In this proof-of-principle research communication, a wearable Doppler ultrasound system is successfully compared to TEE. Preliminary data suggests that the diagnostic accuracy of carotid Doppler ultrasonography at detecting clinically significant SV increment  is enhanced by averaging more cardiac cycles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recovery of therapeutic or functional ambulatory capacity in post-stroke patients is a primary goal of rehabilitation. Wearable powered exoskeletons allow patients with gait dysfunctions to perform over-ground gait training, even immediately after the acute event.
   AIM: To investigate the feasibility and the clinical effects of an over-ground walking training with a wearable powered exoskeleton in sub-acute and chronic stroke patients.
   DESIGN: Prospective, pilot pre-post, open label, non-randomized experimental study.
   SETTING: A single neurological rehabilitation center for inpatients and outpatients.
   POPULATION : Twenty-three post-stroke patients were enrolled: 12 sub-acute (mean age: 43.8 +/- 13.3 years, 5 male and 7 female, 7 right hemiparesis and 5 left hemiparesis) and 11 chronic (mean age: 55.5 +/- 15.9 years, 7 male and 4 female, 4 right hemiparesis and 7 left hemiparesis) patients.
   METHODS: Patients underwent 12 sessions (60 min/session, 3 times/week) of walking rehabilitation training using Ekso T, a wearable bionic suit that enables individuals with lower extremity disabilities and minimal forearm strength to stand up, sit down and walk over a flat hard surface with a full weight-bearing reciprocal gait. Clinical evaluations were performed at the beginning of the training period (t0), after 6 sessions (t1) and after 12 sessions (t2) and were based on the Ashworth scale, Motricity Index, Trunk Control Test, Functional Ambulation Scale, 10-Meter Walking Test, 6-Minute Walking Test, and Walking Handicap Scale. Wilcoxon's test (P<0.05) was used to detect significant changes.
   RESULTS: Statistically significant improvements were observed at the three assessment periods for both groups in Motricity Index, Functional Ambulation Scale, 10-meter walking test, and 6-minute walking test. Sub-acute patients achieved statistically significant improvement in Trunk Control Test and Walking Handicap Scale at t0-t2. Sub-acute and chronic patient did not achieve significant improvement in Ashworth scale at t0-t2.
   CONCLUSIONS: Twelve sessions of over-ground gait training using a powered wearable robotic exoskeleton improved ambulatory functions in sub-acute and chronic post-stroke patients. Large, randomized multicenter studies are needed to confirm these preliminary data.
   CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT : To plan a completely new individual tailored robotic rehabilitation strategy after stroke, including task-oriented over-ground gait training.

AB  - Edge computing extends cloud computing to enhancing network performance in terms of latency and network traffic of many applications such as: The Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Machine to Machine (M2M) technologies, Industrial Internet, and Smart Cities. This extension aims at reducing data communication and transmission through the network However, data processing is the main challenge facing edge computing. In this paper, we proposed a data processing framework based on both edge computing and cloud computing, that is performed by partitioning (classification and restructuring) of data schema on the edge computing level based on feature selection. These features are detected using MapReduce algorithm and a proposed machine learning subsystem built on user requirements. Our approach mainly relies on the assumption that the data sent by edge devices can be used in two forms, as control data (i.e. real-time analytics) and as knowledge extraction data (i.e. historical analytics).We evaluated the proposed framework based on the amount of transmitted, stored data and data retrieval time, the results show that both the amount of sending data was optimized and data retrieval time was highly decreased. Our evaluation was applied experimentally and theoretically on a hypothetical system in a kidney disease center.

AB  - In a developed society, people have more concerned about their health. Thus, improvement of medical field application has been one of the greatest active study areas. Medical statistics show that heart disease is the main reason for morbidity and death in the world. The physician's job is difficult because of having too many factors to analyze in the diagnosis of heart disease. Besides, data and information gained by the physician for diagnosis are often partial and immersed. Recently, health care applications with the Internet of Things (IoT) have offered different dimensions and other online services. These applications have provided a new platform for millions of people to receive benefits from the regular health tips to live a healthy life. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on computer supported diagnosis and IoT to detect and monitor heart failure infected patients, where the data are attained from various other sources. The proposed healthcare system aims at obtaining better precision of diagnosis with ambiguous information. We suggest neutrosophic multi criteria decision making (NMCDM) technique to aid patient and physician to know if patient is suffering from heart failure. Furthermore, through dealing with the uncertainty of imprecision and vagueness resulted from the symmetrical priority scales of different symptoms of disease, users know what extent the disease is dangerous in their body. The proposed model is validated by numerical examples on real case studies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system provides a viable solution that can work at wide range, a new platform to millions of people getting benefit over the decreasing of mortality and cost of clinical treatment related to heart failure.

AB  - Background: Regular physical activity (PA) contributes to the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic diseases and reduces the risk of premature death. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a variety of chronic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint diseases (eg, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis), depression, and colon and breast cancer. Population aging and the related increase in chronic diseases have a major impact on the health care systems of most Western countries and will produce an even more significant effect in the future. Monitoring PA is a valuable method of determining whether people are performing enough PA so as to prevent chronic diseases or are showing early symptoms of those diseases. Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of wearable devices in quantifying the PA of elderly people in a real-life setting. Methods: Participants aged 70 to 90 years with the ability to walk safely without any walking aid for at least 300 meters, who had no walking disabilities or episodes of falling while walking in the last 12 months, were asked to walk 150 meters at their preferred pace wearing a v & iacute;voactive HR device (Garmin Ltd) and actual steps were monitored and tallied by a researcher using a hand-tally counter to assess the performance of the device at a natural speed. A Bland-Altman plot was used to analyze the difference between manually counted steps and wearable device-measured steps. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed (with a 95% confidence interval) between step measurements. The generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) ICCs were estimated, providing a random effect term (random intercept) for the individual measurements (gold standard and device). Both adjusted and conditional ICCs were computed for the GLMM models considering separately the effect of age, sex, BMI, and obesity. Analyses were performed using R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the rms package. Results: A total of 23 females and 26 males were enrolled in the study. The median age of the participants was 75 years. The Bland-Altman plot revealed that, excluding one observation, all differences across measurements were in the confidence bounds, demonstrating the substantial agreement between the step count measurements. The results were confirmed by an ICC equal to .98 (.96-.99), demonstrating excellent agreement between the two sets of measurements. Conclusions: The level of accuracy of wearable devices in quantifying the PA of elderly people in a real-life setting that was found in this study supports the idea of considering wrist-wearable nonmedical devices (widely available in nonspecialized stores) as reliable tools. Both health care professionals and informal caregivers could monitor the level of PA of their patients.

LA  - English
AB  - The pandemics of COVID-19 triggered out an alarm on the public health surveillance. The popularity of wearable devices enables a new perspective for the precaution of the infectious diseases. In this study, we propose a framework, which is based on the heart rate and sleep data collected from the wearable devices, to predict the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in different countries and cities. On top of a physiological anomaly detection algorithm defined based on wearable device data, an online neural network prediction modelling methodology combining both detected physiological anomaly rate and historical COVID-19 infection rate is explored. 4 models are trained separately according to geographical segmentation, i.e., North China, Central China, South China, and South-Central Europe. The de-identified sensor data from about 1.3 million wearable device users are used for verification. Experiment results indicate that the prediction models can be utilized to alert the outbreak of COVID-19 in advance, which sheds light on a health surveillance system with wearable device.

AB  - The functionality of the Internet is continually changing from the Internet of Computers (IoC) to the "Internet of Things (IoT)". Most connected systems, called Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), are formed from the integration of numerous features such as humans and the physical environment, smart objects, and embedded devices and infrastructure. There are a few critical problems, such as security risks and ethical issues that could affect the IoT and CPS. When every piece of data and device is connected and obtainable on the network, hackers can obtain it and utilise it for different scams. In medical healthcare IoT-CPS, everyday medical and physical data of a patient may be gathered through wearable sensors. This paper proposes an AI-enabled IoT-CPS which doctors can utilise to discover diseases in patients based on AI. AI was created to find a few disorders such as Diabetes, Heart disease and Gait disturbances. Each disease has various symptoms among patients or elderly. Dataset is retrieved from the Kaggle repository to execute AI-enabled IoT-CPS technology. For the classification, AI-enabled IoT-CPS Algorithm is used to discover diseases. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with existing algorithms, the proposed AI-enabled IoT-CPS algorithm detects patient diseases and fall events in elderly more efficiently in terms of Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F-measure.

AB  - PURPOSE Unplanned health care encounters (UHEs) such as emergency room visits can occur commonly during cancer chemotherapy treatments. Patients at an increased risk of UHEs are typically identified by clinicians using performance status (PS) assessments based on a descriptive scale, such as the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale. Such assessments can be bias prone, resulting in PS score disagreements between assessors. We therefore propose to evaluate PS using physical activity measurements (eg, energy expenditure) from wearable activity trackers. Specifically, we examined the feasibility of using a wristband (band) and a smartphone app for PS assessments.
   METHODS We conducted an observational study on a cohort of patients with solid tumor receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Patients were instructed to wear the band for a 60-day activity-tracking period. During clinic visits, we obtained ECOG scores assessed by physicians, coordinators, and patients themselves. UHEs occurring during the activity-tracking period plus a 90-day follow-up period were later compiled. We defined our primary outcome as the percentage of patients adherent to band-wear >= 80% of 10 AM to 8 PM for >= 80% of the activity-tracking period. In an exploratory analysis, we computed hourly metabolic equivalent of task (MET) and counted 10 AM to 8 PM hours with. 1.5 METs as nonsedentary physical activity hours.
   RESULTS Forty-one patients completed the study (56.1% female; 61.0% age 40-60 years); 68% were adherent to band-wear. ECOG score disagreement between assessors ranged from 35.3% to 50.0%. In our exploratory analysis, lower average METs and nonsedentary hours, but not higher ECOG scores, were associated with higher 150-day UHEs.
   CONCLUSION The use of a wearable activity tracker is generally feasible in a similar population of patients with cancer. A larger randomized controlled trial should be conducted to confirm the association between lower nonsedentary hours and higher UHEs. (C) 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB  - The early diagnosis of pre-existing coronary disorders helps to control complications such as pulmonary hypertension, irregular cardiac functioning, and heart failure. Machine-based learning of heart sound is an efficient technology which can help minimize the workload of manual auscultation by automatically identifying irregular cardiac sounds. Phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms provide the much-needed information for the diagnosis of these diseases. In this work, the researchers have converted the heart sound signal into its corresponding repeating pattern-based spectrogram. PhysioNet 2016 and PASCAL 2011 have been taken as the benchmark datasets to perform experimentation. The existing models, viz. MobileNet, Xception, Visual Geometry Group (VGG16), ResNet, DenseNet, and InceptionV3 of Transfer Learning have been used for classifying the heart sound signals as normal and abnormal. For PhysioNet 2016, DenseNet has outperformed its peer models with an accuracy of 89.04 percent, whereas for PASCAL 2011, VGG has outperformed its peer approaches with an accuracy of 92.96 percent.

AB  - Changing behavior related to improper lifestyle habits has attracted attention as a solution to prevent lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, arteriosclerosis, and stroke. To drive health behavior changes, wearable devices are needed, and they must not only provide accurate sensing and visualization functions but also effective intervention functions. In this paper, we propose a health support system, WaistonBelt X, that consists of a belt-type wearable device with sensing and intervention functions and a smartphone application. WaistonBelt X can automatically measure a waistline with a magnetometer that detects the movements of a blade installed in the buckle, and monitor the basic activities of daily living with inertial sensors. Furthermore, WaistonBelt X intervenes with the user to correct lifestyle habits by using a built-in vibrator. Through evaluation experiments, we confirmed that our proposed device achieves measurement of the circumference on the belt position (mean absolute error of 0.93 cm) and basic activity recognition (F1 score of 0.95) with high accuracy. In addition, we confirmed that the intervention via belt vibration effectively improves the sitting posture of the user.

AB  - To support stroke survivors in activities of daily living, wearable soft-robotic gloves are being developed. An essential feature for use in daily life is detection of movement intent to trigger actuation without substantial delays. To increase efficacy, the intention to grasp should be detected as soon as possible, while other movements are not detected instead. Therefore, the possibilities to classify reach and grasp movements of stroke survivors, and to detect the intention of grasp movements, were investigated using inertial sensing. Hand and wrist movements of 10 stroke survivors were analyzed during reach and grasp movements using inertial sensing and a Support Vector Machine classifier. The highest mean accuracies of 96.8% and 83.3% were achieved for single- and multi-user classification respectively. Accuracies up to 90% were achieved when using 80% of the movement length, or even only 50% of the movement length after choosing the optimal kernel per person. This would allow for an earlier detection of 300-750 ms, but at the expense of accuracy. In conclusion, inertial sensing combined with the Support Vector Machine classifier is a promising method for actuation of grasp-supporting devices to aid stroke survivors in activities of daily living. Online implementation should be investigated in future research.

AB  - Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is the most common cancer in children, and its diagnosis mainly includes microscopic blood tests of the bone marrow. Therefore, there is a need for a correct classification of white blood cells. The approach developed in this article is based on an optimized and small IoT-friendly neural network architecture. The application of learning transfer in hybrid artificial intelligence systems is offered. The hybrid system consisted of a MobileNet v2 encoder pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and machine learning algorithms performing the role of the head. These were the XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree algorithms. In this work, the average accuracy was over 90%, reaching 97.4%. This work proves that using hybrid artificial intelligence systems for tasks with a low computational complexity of the processing units demonstrates a high classification accuracy. The methods used in this study, confirmed by the promising results, can be an effective tool in diagnosing other blood diseases, facilitating the work of a network of medical institutions to carry out the correct treatment schedule.

AB  - Despite ample research on the association between indoor air pollution and allergic disease prevalence, public health and environmental policies still lack predictive evidence for developing a preventive guideline for patients or vulnerable populations mostly due to limitation of real-time big data and model predictability. Recent popularity of IoT and machine learning techniques could provide enabling technologies for collecting real-time big data and analyzing them for more accurate prediction of allergic disease risks for evidence-based intervention, but the effort is still in its infancy. This pilot study explored and evaluated the feasibility of a deep learning algorithm for predicting asthma risk. It is based on peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) of 14 pediatric asthma patients visiting the Korea University Medical Center and indoor particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 concentration data collected at their residence every 10 minutes using a PM monitoring device with a low-cost sensor between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. We interpolated the PEFR results collected twice a day for each patient throughout the day so that it can be matched to the PM and other weather data. The PEFR results were classified into three categories such as 'Green' (normal), 'Yellow' (mild to moderate exacerbation) and 'Red' (severe exacerbation) with reference to their best peak flow value. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was trained using the first 10 months of the linked data and predicted asthma risk categories for the next 2 months during the study period. LSTM model is found to predict the asthma risk categories better than multinomial logistic (MNL) regression as it incorporates the cumulative effects of PM concentrations over time. Upon successful modifications of the algorithm based on a larger sample, this approach could potentially play a groundbreaking role for the scientific data-driven medical decision making.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease with a high blood glucose level, leading to both seriously acute and chronic complications. The closed-loop system is an ideal system for diabetes management. However, the large size and high cost of the commercial systems restrict their widespread uses. Here, we present for the first time a microtube-based wearable closed-loop minisystem for diabetes management. The closed-loop minisystem includes a biosensing device, an electroosmotic micropump, and a printed circuit board (PCB) with an algorithm. The microtube-based sensing device coated on the outer surface of the microtube is inserted into subcutaneous tissue for detecting interstitial glucose; the current signal for sensing glucose is processed by the PCB to power the electroosmotic micropump intelligently for the delivery of insulin into the subcutaneous tissue via the microtube channel. The closed-loop minisystem worn on a diabetic SD rat can successfully maintain its blood glucose level within a safe level. It is expected that this new closed-loop paradigm could open up new prospects for clinical diabetes management.

AB  - The present paper aims to describe the project and development of an ECG monitoring system which is able to diagnose specific cardiac pathologies by adapting the processing algorithm to the monitored patient. The system can work standalone by providing the final diagnosis to the patient by a LEDs set. In addition, an IoT based architecture allows the system to share data and diagnosis with a remote cardiologist in real-time or to store data in a FTP folder, as an Holter monitor, for post-processing and further analysis. The system consists of two sections: the digital one, based on the National Instruments MyRIO, digitalises the signal and processes it in real-time to make a diagnosis on possible occurring cardiac pathologies (bradycardia, tachycardia, infarction, ischemia); the analog section, which performs the acquisition, amplification, and pre-liminary filtering of a 3-leads electrocardiographic signal. The processing algorithm has been developed in NI LabVIEW environment. The main contribution to the state of the art is due to two removable and updatable memory devices. A first memory has been used to store clinical and personal data of patient so to configure the computing algorithm and adapt it to the monitored patient. A second memory has been used to store accuracy and uncertainty specifications of the ECG system in order to improve the reliability of the final diagnosis. The system aims to provide an electrocardiographic monitoring system for healthcare applications in the smart city context. The possibility to monitor constantly the patient health state at home is an important challenge of the next future smart cities. IoT and automation are the main aspects of the proposed system. Patients having chronic heart diseases need frequent hospitalizations to check their heart health. In this scenario, the proposed system is an Ambient Assisted Living solution developed to encourage the independent life of cardiac subjects by supporting his/her care and wellness during the daily life.

AB  - Worldwide, 16.7 million people die each year due to cardiovascular disease. These statistics raise demand of devices like sensor-based pacemakers (PM) which are not just doing heart rate augmentation but also capable to transmit information via wireless link to on body sensor and support remote monitoring of such patients. As per the world health organization WHO reports there are more than 3 million functioning PMs and about 600,000 pacemakers are implanted each year in world. On an average, 70-80% of PMs are implanted in aged patients around 65 years or older. In addition to continuous monitoring of cardiovascular parameters, detection of physical movement of such patients may be helpful to assess their well-being. This paper has been formulated with an aim to highlight an approach which may be used to detect the physical movement of the patient using information signal received from implanted PM. The transmitted signal will experience a pathloss offered by wireless human body channel, which will affect the link quality parameters namely Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Bit Error Rate (BER) and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). In the current work mathematical model has been formulated considering in body and on body channel propagation conditions and received power, received energy, pathloss, SNR, BER, bit rate, energy per bit and RSSI have been evaluated using IEEE802.15.6 channel models CM2 and CM3. Data set has been created and human body movement has been detected using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Prediction accuracy of Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) and Random Forest have been compared. The analysis performed depicts that human body movement can be detected using different channel models and ML techniques such as MLP, kNN and Random Forest with an accuracy of 65.3%, 72.8% and 93.4% respectively. The critical comparison of the result indicates that the performance of Random Forest is better than MLP and kNN. This approach will be helpful in remote detection of human body movement of patients.

AB  - In this human-challenge study, participants were monitored using wearable electrocardiogram sensors integrated with accelerometers. A semisupervised machine learning algorithm detected the infection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, on average 23 hours before the onset of symptoms.
   Background The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for early detection of viral infections in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals to allow for timely clinical management and public health interventions. Methods Twenty healthy adults were challenged with an influenza A (H3N2) virus and prospectively monitored from 7 days before through 10 days after inoculation, using wearable electrocardiogram and physical activity sensors. This framework allowed for responses to be accurately referenced to the infection event. For each participant, we trained a semisupervised multivariable anomaly detection model on data acquired before inoculation and used it to classify the postinoculation dataset. Results Inoculation with this challenge virus was well-tolerated with an infection rate of 85%. With the model classification threshold set so that no alarms were recorded in the 170 healthy days recorded, the algorithm correctly identified 16 of 17 (94%) positive presymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, on average 58 hours postinoculation and 23 hours before the symptom onset. Conclusions The data processing and modeling methodology show promise for the early detection of respiratory illness. The detection algorithm is compatible with data collected from smartwatches using optical techniques but needs to be validated in large heterogeneous cohorts in normal living conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Accurately assessing people's gait, especially in real-world conditions and in case of impaired mobility, is still a challenge due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors resulting in gait complexity. To improve the estimation of gait-related digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) in real-world scenarios, this study presents a wearable multi-sensor system (INDIP), integrating complementary sensing approaches (two plantar pressure insoles, three inertial units and two distance sensors).Methods: The INDIP technical validity was assessed against stereophotogrammetry during a laboratory experimental protocol comprising structured tests (including continuous curvilinear and rectilinear walking and steps) and a simulation of daily-life activities (including intermittent gait and short walking bouts). To evaluate its performance on various gait patterns, data were collected on 128 participants from seven cohorts: healthy young and older adults, patients with Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and proximal femur fracture. Moreover, INDIP usability was evaluated by recording 2.5-h of real-world unsupervised activity.Results and discussion: Excellent absolute agreement (ICC >0.95) and very limited mean absolute errors were observed for all cohorts and digital mobility outcomes (cadence =0.61 steps/min, stride length =0.02 m, walking speed =0.02 m/s) in the structured tests. Larger, but limited, errors were observed during the daily-life simulation (cadence 2.72-4.87 steps/min, stride length 0.04-0.06 m, walking speed 0.03-0.05 m/s). Neither major technical nor usability issues were declared during the 2.5-h acquisitions. Therefore, the INDIP system can be considered a valid and feasible solution to collect reference data for analyzing gait in real-world conditions.

AB  - The rapid rates of industrialization and urbanization have induced considerable changes in family structures, increasing the number of older adults who voluntarily or involuntarily live alone. The rapid increase in the population of older adults living alone has raised many safety concerns, with fall-induced injuries and dementia presenting immediate dangers to older adults. Falls are prevalent in older adults, and not only cause injuries for the individuals, but also impose an extremely heavy burden on family members and caregivers. Furthermore, dementia is common among older adults in aging societies and is usually accompanied by dysfunctions in daily living activities, causing considerable difficulties for family members. The objective of this study was to develop a remote monitoring and control (M&C) smart floor system for detecting falls and wandering patterns in older adults with dementia in order to provide comprehensive care assistance. The proposed system integrates a floor detection sensor and Wi-Fi technology to analyze and determine the occurrence of falls and wandering in older adults with dementia. Conventionally, detection processes for falls and wandering in older adults with dementia are conducted using visual monitoring or wearable detectors, which may reduce the privacy, comfort, and convenience of older adults. By contrast, the proposed system maintains users' privacy and eliminates the inconvenience associated with wearing detectors. The system determines fall behaviors andwandering patterns in older adults with dementia; when an accident occurs, the system can issue a warning and notify medical care units or relatives for immediate attention, thus reducing the occurrence of further accidents. The remote M&C and warning functions of the proposed system were verified through experiments.

AB  - Fog computing gives various kinds of properties over the internet which allows utilizing different types of services from industries. In these cloud architectures, the key bottleneck is their restricted scalability and therefore incapacity to meet the requirements of centralized computing environments focused on the Internet of Things (IoT). The vital clarification for this is that inertness touchy applications, for example, wellbeing observing and observation frameworks currently need processing over a lot of information (Big Data) moved to concentrated data set and from data set to cloud server farms which prompts drop in execution of such frame works. Fog and edge computing latest paradigms offer revolutionary technologies by taking user services closer and delivering low latency and energy-productive information preparing arrangements contrasted with cloud areas. However the latest fog models have several drawbacks and concentrate on either outcome precision or it may down the time of response but not under narrow perspective. The proposed novel system called ABFog which integrating with edge computing devices in deep learning and it is useful to analyze Heart disease automatically in real-time application. Fog computing is enabled in cloud framework to utilize the Fog Bus which is used to convey the accuracy to present the proposed model. ABFog is useful to provide best quality of service in various configuration modes or to predict accuracy as needed to assort in different situations and for various users prerequisites.

AB  - Introduction: Screening for atrial fibrillation and timely initiation of oral anticoagulation, rhythm management, and treatment of concomitant cardiovascular conditions can improve outcomes in high-risk populations. Whether wearables can facilitate screening in older adults is not known.& nbsp;Methods and Analyses: The multicenter, international, investigator-initiated, single-arm case-finding Smartphone and wearable detected atrial arrhythmia in older adults case finding study (Smart in OAC - AFNET 9) evaluates the diagnostic yield of a validated, cloud-based analysis algorithm detecting atrial arrhythmias via a signal acquired by a smartphone-coupled wristband monitoring system in older adults. Unselected participants aged & GE;65 years without known atrial fibrillation and not receiving oral anticoagulation are enrolled in three European countries. Participants undergo continuous pulse monitoring using a wristband with a photo plethysmography (PPG) sensor and a telecare analytic service. Participants with PPG-detected atrial arrhythmias will be offered ECG loop monitoring. The study has a virtual design with digital consent and teleconsultations, whilst including hybrid solutions. Primary outcome is the proportion of older adults with newly detected atrial arrhythmias (NCT04579159).& nbsp;Discussion: Smart in OAC - AFNET 9 will provide information on wearable-based screening for PPG-detected atrial arrhythmias in Europe and provide an estimate of the prevalence of atrial arrhythmias in an unselected population of older adults.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation is the most common persistent arrhythmia. It is associated with increased mortality and morbidity such as stroke. The early detection of atrial fibrillation can significantly reduce the risk of stroke through preventive anticoagulation. Smartwatches offer the opportunity to screen for atrial fibrillation in the general population. This paper aims to analyze the ethical challenges associated with screening for atrial fibrillation using smartwatches.
   Methods: This is an ethical analysis. The methodology is based on the principle-orientated approach of Beauchamp and Childress. The principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy have to be guaranteed given the influence of private companies, privacy protection, liability and doctor-patient-relationship. The work is based on a systematic literature research.
   Results: There is currently no evidence that screening for atrial fibrillation with smartwatches improves the outcome and reduces the number of adverse events. The high number of false-positive results can lead to harm. The principle of non-maleficence is violated. The over-reliance on and the lack of adequate education by smartwatches can worsen the doctor-patient relationship. However, the relationship can also be improved by the proactive participation of the patient, which leads to greater autonomy, compliance and in the end beneficence. Since smartwatches are consumer goods, there is a risk for greater disparities in the poor and rich population. There is also a risk of discrimination against ethnic minorities due to underrepresentation in training data and study cohorts. The principle of justice is violated. The storage of sensitive medical data by private companies also raises many ethical and legal concerns.
   Conclusion: This analysis has shown that the use of smartwatches to detect atrial fibrillation is currently in an ethical perspective problematic. The lack of evidence and the high number of false-positive results can lead to harm. As smartwatches provide only little information about the possible consequences, informed consent cannot be assumed. Ethical implementation could be archived if doctors provide smartwatches to patients who have been shown to benefit from them. The implementation and education should be managed by the doctor.

AB  - This paper aims to design and implement a system capable of distinguishing between different activities carried out during a tennis match. The goal is to achieve the correct classification of a set of tennis strokes. The system must exhibit robustness to the variability of the height, age or sex of any subject that performs the actions. A new database is developed to meet this objective. The system is based on two sensor nodes using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) wireless technology to communicate with a PC that acts as a central device to collect the information received by the sensors. The data provided by these sensors are processed to calculate their spectrograms. Through the application of innovative deep learning techniques with semi-supervised training, it is possible to carry out the extraction of characteristics and the classification of activities. Preliminary results obtained with a data set of eight players, four women and four men have shown that our approach is able to address the problem of the diversity of human constitutions, weight and sex of different players, providing accuracy greater than 96.5% to recognize the tennis strokes of a new player never seen before by the system.

AB  - Upper limb impairment is one of the most common problems for people with neurological disabilities, affecting their activity, quality of life (QOL), and independence. Objective assessment of upper limb performance is a promising way to help patients with neurological upper limb disorders. By using wearable sensors, such as an egocentric camera, it is possible to monitor and objectively assess patients' actual performance in activities of daily life (ADLs). We analyzed the possibility of using Deep Learning models for depth estimation based on a single RGB image to allow the monitoring of patients with 2D (RGB) cameras. We conducted experiments placing objects at different distances from the camera and varying the lighting conditions to evaluate the performance of the depth estimation provided by two deep learning models (MiDaS & Alhashim). Finally, we integrated the best performing model for depth-estimation (MiDaS) with other Deep Learning models for hand (MediaPipe) and object detection (YOLO) and evaluated the system in a task of hand-object interaction. Our tests showed that our final system has a 78% performance in detecting interactions, while the reference performance using a 3D (depth) camera is 84%.

AB  - The electrocardiograph (ECG) signal is an essential biomedical human body signal that shows heart activity and can diagnose cardiovascular diseases. Many researchers investigate heartbeats detection and classification based on ECG to achieve a high-performance method. The main problem with improving performance is increasing the computation, such as in many existing methods. In this paper, a new artificial neural network (ANN) method named Selective-Mask Artificial Neural Network (SMANN) is proposed to improve the performance with low computational processes. Furthermore, A new mixture of features from reused the QRS-detection stage features and the others features from the RR-interval and between-RR are used to decrease the computation for features extraction. The proposed method performance evaluation is based on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database using MATLAB program for software evaluation moreover a hardware implementation. The proposed method's promising results show high accuracy of 99.9224 %, and the total classification errors for the SMANN are 80 comparing with the 583 errors for the same data with traditional ANN. The method with low error assists the clinical decision-maker in diagnosing the long-time ECG signals or the real-time monitoring. It was implemented as a prototype wearable system using Node-MCU with the internet of things (IoT). The system can operate online patient monitoring and offline for heartbeats detection and classification.

AB  - Introduction: Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce the risk of organ failure and mortality in systemic inflammatory conditions. Heart rate variability (HRV) has potential for early identification of the onset of systemic inflammation, as it may detect changes in sympathetic nervous system activity resulting from the developing inflammatory response before clinical signs appear. With the use of new methodologies, we investigated the onset and kinetics of HRV changes as well as several inflammatory parameters and symptoms during experimental human endotoxemia, a model of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo. Patients and Methods: Healthy volunteers were intravenously administered LPS (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15). HRV was determined using a wireless wearable device, and parameters low to high frequency (LF:HF) ratio, root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD), and standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN)were calculated through 1-min-rolling 6-min windows. Plasma cytokine levels and flu-like symptoms and vital signs were serially assessed. Results: The increase in LF:HF ratio, reflecting sympathetic predominance, was more pronounced in the LPS group compared to the placebo group, with the difference becoming statistically significant 65 min following LPS administration (1.63 [1.42-1.83] vs. 1.28 [1.11-1.44], P = 0.005). Significant between-group differences in RMSSD and SDNN were observed from 127 to 140 min post-LPS administration onwards, respectively. Plasma cytokine levels showed significant between-group differences staring 60 min post-LPS. For symptom score, heart rate, temperature, and diastolic blood pressure, significant differences compared with the placebo group were observed at 90, 118, 120, and 124 min post-LPS, respectively. Conclusion: In a controlled human model of systemic inflammation, elevations in the LF:HF ratio followed very shortly after elevations in plasma cytokine levels and preceded onset of flu-like symptoms and alterations in vital signs. HRV may represent a promising non-invasive tool for early detection of a developing systemic inflammatory response.

AB  - Fever in children is one of the most common symptoms of pediatric diseases and the most common complaint in pediatric clinics, especially in the emergency department. Diseases such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis are leading causes of death in children, and the early manifestations of these diseases are accompanied by fever symptoms. Accurate diagnosis and real-time monitoring of the status of febrile children, rapid and effective identification of the cause, and treatment can have a positive impact on relieving their symptoms and improving their quality of life. In recent years, wearable diagnostic sensors have attracted special attention for their high flexibility, real-time monitoring, and sensitivity. Temperature sensors and heart rate sensors have provided new advances in detecting children's body temperature and heart rate. Furthermore, some novel formulations have also received wide attention for addressing bottlenecks in medication administration for febrile children, such as difficulty in swallowing and inaccurate dosing. In this context, the present review provides recent advances of novel wearable medical sensor devices for diagnosing fever. Moreover, the application progress of innovative dosage forms of classical antipyretic drugs for children is presented. Finally, challenges and prospects of wearable sensor-based diagnostics and novel agent-based treatment of fever in children are discussed in brief.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI), usually termed as heart attack, is one of the main cardiovascular diseases that occur due to the blockage of coronary arteries. This blockage reduces the blood supply to heart muscles, and a prolonged deficiency of blood supply causes the death of heart muscles leading to a heart attack that may cause death. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to diagnose MI as it causes variations like ST-T changes in the recorded ECG. Manual inspection of these variations is a tedious task and also requires expertise as the variations produced by MI are often very short in duration with a low amplitude. Hence, these changes may be misinterpreted, leading to delayed diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Therefore, computer-aided analysis of ECG may help to detect MI automatically. In this study, a robust deep learning model is proposed to detect MI based on heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of ECG signals from a single lead. Ultrashort-term HRV analysis is performed to compute HRV analysis features from time-domain and frequency-domain parameters through power spectral density estimations. Nonlinear HRV parameters are also computed using Poincare Plot, Recurrence Analysis, and Detrended Fluctuation Analysis. A finely tuned customized artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm is applied on 23 HRV features for MI detection and classification. The K-fold validation method is used to avoid any biases in results and reported 99.1% accuracy, 100% sensitivity, 98.1% specificity, and 99.0% F1 for MI detection, whereas 98.85% accuracy, 97.40% sensitivity, 99.05% specificity, and 97.70% F1 score is achieved for classification. Furthermore, the ANN algorithm completed its execution in just 59 seconds that indicates the efficiency of the proposed ANN model. The overall performance in terms of computed evaluation matrices and execution time indicates the robustness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Thus, the proposed model can be used for high-performance MI detection, even in wearable devices.

AB  - The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19 pandemic highlights the critical importance of ubiquitous respiratory health monitoring. The two fundamental elements of monitoring respiration are respiration rate (the frequency of breathing) and tidal volume [(TV) the volume of air breathed by the lungs in each breath]. Wearable sensing systems have been demonstrated to provide accurate measurement of respiration rate, but TV remains challenging to measure accurately with wearable and unobtrusive technology. In this work, we leveraged electrocardiogram (ECG) and seismocardiogram (SCG) measurements obtained with a custom wearable sensing patch to derive an estimate of TV from healthy human participants. Specifically, we fused both an ECG-derived respiratory signal (EDR) and an SCG-derived respiratory signal (SDR) and trained a machine learning model with gas rebreathing as the ground truth to estimate TV. The respiration cycle modulates ECG and SCG signals in multiple different ways that are synergistic. Thus, here, we extract EDRs and SDRs using a multitude of different demodulation techniques. The extracted features are used to train a subject-independent machine learning model to accurately estimate TV. By fusing the extracted EDRs and SDRs, we were able to estimate the TV with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 181.45 mL and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.61, with a global subject-independent model. We further show that SDRs are better TV estimators than EDRs. Among SDRs, amplitude modulation (AM) SCG features are the most correlated with TV. We demonstrated that fusing EDRs and SDRs can result in a moderately accurate estimation of the TV using a subject-independent model. Additionally, we highlight the most informative features for estimating TV. This work presents a significant step toward achieving continuous, calibration-free, and unobtrusive TV estimation, which could advancethe state of the art in wearable respiratory monitoring.

AB  - The use of wearables is increasing and data from these devices could improve the prediction of changes in glycemic control. We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist-worn or wrist-worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist-worn wearables were used vs. waist-worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes.

AB  - An objective evaluation of patient performance status (PS) is difficult because patients spend the majority of their time outside of the clinic, self-report to providers, and undergo dynamic changes throughout their treatment experience. Real-time, objective activity data may allow for a more accurate assessment of PS and physical function, while reducing the subjectivity and bias associated with current assessments. Consenting patients with advanced cancer wore a wearble activity monitor for three consecutive visits in a prospective, single-cohort clinical trial. Provider-assessed PS (ECOG/Karnofsky) and NIH PROMIS (R) patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed at each visit. Associations between wearable activity monitor metrics (steps, distance, stairs) and PS, clinical outcomes (adverse events, hospitalizations, survival), and PROs were assessed using correlation statistics and in multivariable logistic regression models. Thirty-seven patients were evaluated (54% male, median 62 years). Patients averaged 3700 steps, 1.7 miles, and 3 flights of stairs per day. Highest correlations were observed between average daily steps and ECOG-PS and KPS (r = 0.63 and r = 0.69, respectively p < 0.01). Each 1000 steps/day increase was associated with reduced odds for adverse events (OR: 0.34, 95% CI 0.13, 0.94), hospitalizations (OR: 0.21 95% CI 0.56, 0.79), and hazard for death (HR: 0.48 95% CI 0.28-0.83). Significant correlations were also observed between activity metrics and PROs. Our trial demonstrates the feasibility of using wearable activity monitors to assess PS in advanced cancer patients and suggests their potential use to predict clinical and patient-reported outcomes. These findings should be validated in larger, randomized trials.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most lethal type of cancer for all women worldwide. At the moment, there are no effective techniques for preventing or curing breast cancer, as the source of the disease is unclear. Early diagnosis is a highly successful means of detecting and managing breast cancer, and early identification may result in a greater likelihood of complete recovery. Mammography is the most effective method of detecting breast cancer early. Additionally, this instrument enables the detection of additional illnesses and may provide information about the nature of cancer, such as benign, malignant, or normal. This article discusses an evolutionary approach for classifying and detecting breast cancer that is based on machine learning and image processing. This model combines image preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and machine learning techniques to aid in the classification and identification of skin diseases. To enhance the image's quality, a geometric mean filter is used. AlexNet is used for extracting features. Feature selection is performed using the relief algorithm. For disease categorization and detection, the model makes use of the machine learning techniques such as least square support vector machine, KNN, random forest, and Naive Bayes. The experimental investigation makes use of MIAS data collection. This proposed technology is advantageous for accurately identifying breast cancer disease using image analysis.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common condition among cancer patients, across several points in the disease trajectory. Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy.Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework, enabling to build machine learning models for the prediction and monitoring of depression without direct access to user's personal data.Discussion: Improvements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings.

AB  - The primary treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD) is supplementation of levodopa (L-dopa). With disease progression, people may experience motor and non-motor fluctuations, whereby the PD symptoms return before the next dose of medication. Paradoxically, in order to prevent wearing-off, one must take the next dose while still feeling well, as the upcoming off episodes can be unpredictable. Waiting until feeling wearing-off and then taking the next dose of medication is a sub-optimal strategy, as the medication can take up to an hour to be absorbed. Ultimately, early detection of wearing-off before people are consciously aware would be ideal. Towards this goal, we examined whether or not a wearable sensor recording autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity could be used to predict wearing-off in people on L-dopa. We had PD subjects on L-dopa record a diary of their on/off status over 24 hours while wearing a wearable sensor (E4 wristband((R))) that recorded ANS dynamics, including electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate (HR), blood volume pulse (BVP), and skin temperature (TEMP). A joint empirical mode decomposition (EMD) / regression analysis was used to predict wearing-off (WO) time. When we used individually specific models assessed with cross-validation, we obtained > 90% correlation between the original OFF state logged by the patients and the reconstructed signal. However, a pooled model using the same combination of ASR measures across subjects was not statistically significant. This proof-of-principle study suggests that ANS dynamics can be used to assess the on/off phenomenon in people with PD taking L-dopa, but must be individually calibrated. More work is required to determine if individual wearing-off detection can take place before people become consciously aware of it.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to investigate the association between sleep HRV and long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes, and further explore whether HRV features can assist the automatic CVD prediction.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed polysomnography (PSG) data obtained from 2111 participants in the Sleep Heart Health Study, who were followed up for a median of 11.8 years after PSG acquisition. During follow-up, 1252 participants suffered CVD events (CVD group) and 859 participants remained CVD-free (non-CVD group). HRV measures, derived from time-domain and frequency-domain, were calculated. Regression models were created to determine the independent predictor for long-term CVD outcomes, and to explore the association between HRV and CVD latency. Furthermore, based on HRV and other clinical features, a model was trained to automatically predict CVD outcomes using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm.
   Results: Compared with the non-CVD group, decreased HRV during sleep was found in the CVD group. HRV, particularly its component of high frequency (HF), was demonstrated to be independent predictor of CVD outcomes. Moreover, normalized HF was positively correlated with CVD latency. The proposed prediction model achieved a total accuracy of 75.3%, in which sleep HRV features served as a supplement to the well-recognized CVD risk factors, such as aging, adiposity and sleep disorders.
   Conclusions: Association between sleep HRV and long-term CVD outcomes was demonstrated here, suggesting that altered HRV during sleep might occur many years prior to the onset of CVD. Machine learning models, combining sleep HRV and other clinical characteristics, should be promising in the early prediction of CVD outcomes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Because of the scarcity of caregivers and the high cost of medical devices, it is difficult to keep track of the aging population and provide assistance. To avoid deterioration of health issues, continuous monitoring of personal health should be done prior to the intervention. If a problem is discovered, the IoT platform collects and presents the caretaker with graphical data. The death rates of older patients are reduced when projections are made ahead of time. Patients can die as a result of minor abnormalities in their ECG. The cardiac dysrhythmia/irregular heart rate is classified with several multilayer parameters using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach in this paper. The key benefit of utilizing this CNN approach is that it can handle databases that have been purposefully oversampled. Using the XGBoost approach, these are oversampled to deal with difficulties like minority class and imbalance. XGBoost is a decision tree-based ensemble learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. It uses an artificial neural network and predicts the unstructured data in a structured manner. This CNN-based supervised learning model is tested and simulated on a real-time elderly heart patient IoT dataset. The proposed methodology has a recall value of 100%, an F1-Score of 94.8%, a precision of 98%, and an accuracy of 98%, which is higher than existing approaches like decision trees, random forests, and Support Vector Machine. The results reveal that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methodologies and improves elderly heart disease patient monitoring with a low error rate.

AB  - The accurate and efficient diagnosis of breast cancer is extremely necessary for recovery and treatment in early stages in IoT healthcare environment. Internet of Things has witnessed the transition in life for the last few years which provides a way to analyze both the real-time data and past data by the emerging role of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques. The current state-of-the-art method does not effectively diagnose the breast cancer in the early stages, and most of the ladies suffered from this dangerous disease. Thus, the early detection of breast cancer significantly poses a great challenge for medical experts and researchers. To solve the problem of early-stage detection of breast cancer, we proposed machine learning-based diagnostic system which effectively classifies the malignant and benign people in the environment of IoT. In the development of our proposed system, a machine learning classifier support vector machine is used to classify the malignant and benign people. To improve the classification performance of the classification system, we used a recursive feature selection algorithm to select more suitable features from the breast cancer dataset. The training/testing splits method is applied for training and testing of the classifier for the best predictive model. Additionally, the classifier performance has been checked on by using performance evaluation metrics such as classification, specificity, sensitivity, Matthews's correlation coefficient, F1-score, and execution time. To test the proposed method, the dataset "Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer" has been used in this research study. The experimental results demonstrate that the recursive feature selection algorithm selects the best subset of features, and the classifier SVM achieved optimal classification performance on this best subset of features. The SVM kernel linear achieved high classification accuracy (99%), specificity (99%), and sensitivity (98%), and the Matthews's correlation coefficient is 99%. From these experimental results, we concluded that the proposed system performance is excellent due to the selection of more appropriate features that are selected by the recursive feature selection algorithm. Furthermore, we suggest this proposed system for effective and efficient early stages diagnosis of breast cancer. Thus, through this system, the recovery and treatment will be more effective for breast cancer. Lastly, the implementation of the proposed system is very reliable in all aspects of IoT healthcare for breast cancer.

AB  - Stumbling during gait is commonly encountered in patients who suffer from mild to serious walking problems, e.g., after stroke, in osteoarthritis, or amputees using a lower leg prosthesis. Instead of self-reporting, an objective assessment of the number of stumbles in daily life would inform clinicians more accurately and enable the evaluation of treatments that aim to achieve a safer walking pattern. An easy-to-use wearable might fulfill this need. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) placed at the shank and machine learning algorithms could be used to detect and classify stumbling events in a dataset comprising of a wide variety of daily movements. Ten healthy test subjects were deliberately tripped by an unexpected and unseen obstacle while walking on a treadmill. The subjects stumbled a total of 276 times, both using an elevating recovery strategy and a lowering recovery strategy. Subjects also performed multiple Activities of Daily Living. During data processing, an event-defined window segmentation technique was used to trace high peaks in acceleration that could potentially be stumbles. In the reduced dataset, time windows were labelled with the aid of video annotation. Subsequently, discriminative features were extracted and fed to train seven different types of machine learning algorithms. Trained machine learning algorithms were validated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were most successful, and could detect and classify stumbles with 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity, and 96.7% accuracy in the independent testing dataset. The SVM algorithms were implemented in a user-friendly, freely available, stumble detection app named Stumblemeter. This work shows that stumble detection and classification based on SVM is accurate and ready to apply in clinical practice.

AB  - Having a cognitive and self-optimizing network that proactively adapts not only to channel conditions, but also according to its users' needs can be one of the highest forthcoming priorities of future 6G Heterogeneous Networks (HetNets). In this paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary approach linking the concepts of e-healthcare, priority, big data analytics (BDA) and radio resource optimization in a multi-tier 5G network. We employ three machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely, naive Bayesian (NB) classifier, logistic regression (LR), and decision tree (DT), working as an ensemble system to analyze historical medical records of stroke out-patients (OPs) and readings from body-attached internet-of-things (IoT) sensors to predict the likelihood of an imminent stroke. We convert the stroke likelihood into a risk factor functioning as a priority in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model. Hence, the task is to optimally allocate physical resource blocks (PRBs) to HetNet users while prioritizing OPs by granting them high gain PRBs according to the severity of their medical state. Thus, empowering the OPs to send their critical data to their healthcare provider with minimized delay. To that end, two optimization approaches are proposed, a weighted sum rate maximization (WSRMax) approach and a proportional fairness (PF) approach. The proposed approaches increased the OPs' average signal to interference plus noise (SINR) by 57% and 95%, respectively. The WSRMax approach increased the system's total SINR to a level higher than that of the PF approach, nevertheless, the PF approach yielded higher SINRs for the OPs, better fairness and a lower margin of error.

AB  - Obesity is a global health issue that affects 2.1 billion people worldwide and has an economic impact of approximately $2 trillion. It is a disease that can make the aging process worse by impairing physical function, which can lead to people becoming more frail and immobile. Nevertheless, it is envisioned that technology can be used to aid in motivating behavioural changes to combat this preventable condition. The ubiquitous presence of wearable and mobile devices has enabled a continual stream of quantifiable data (e.g. physiological signals) to be collected about ourselves. This data can then be used to monitor physical activity to aid in self-reflection and motivation to alter behaviour. However, such information is susceptible to noise interference, which makes processing and extracting knowledge from such data challenging. This paper posits our approach that collects and processes physiological data that has been collected from tri-axial accelerometers and a heart-rate monitor, to detect physical activity. Furthermore, an end-user use case application has also been proposed that integrates these findings into a smartwatch visualization. This provides a method of visualising the results to the user so that they are able to gain an overview of their activity. The goal of the paper has been to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning in distinguishing physical activity. This has been achieved by (i) focusing on wearable sensors to collect data and using our methodology to process this raw lifelogging data so that features can be extracted/selected. (ii) Undertaking an evaluation between ten supervised learning classifiers to determine their accuracy in detecting human activity. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, this evaluation has been performed across a baseline method and two other methods. (iii) Undertaking an evaluation of the processing time of the approach and the smartwatch battery and network cost analysis between transferring data from the smartwatch to the phone. The results of the classifier evaluations indicate that our approach shows an improvement on existing studies, with accuracies of up to 99% and sensitivities of 100%.

AB  - Background: Previous studies have shown that the gait of patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus is abnormal compared with the healthy group. Currently, a three-dimensional motion analyzer system is commonly used for gait analysis. However, it is challenging to collect data and use in clinical study due to extensive experimental conditions and high price. In this study, we used a wearable gait analysis system (Gaitboter) to investigate the spatial and temporal parameters, and kinematic data of gait in diabetic patients, especially those with peripheral neuropathy. The aim of the study is to evaluate the wearable gait analysis system in diabetic study.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted a case-control study to analyze the gait of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Gaitboter was used to detect and collect gait data in the ward of Beijing Chao-yang Hospital, Capital Medical University from June 2018 to October 2018. We collected the gait data of participants (N = 146; 73 patients with type 2 diabetes, 16 with peripheral neuropathy and 57 without peripheral neuropathy, and 73 matched controls). The gait data (stance phase, swing phase, double-foot stance phase, single-foot stance phase, walking cadence, stride length, walking speed, off-ground angle, landing angle, maximum swing angle, minimum swing angle, and foot progression angle) in diabetic patients were recorded and compared with controls. SPSS 22.0 statistical software was used to analyzed the gait parameter data.
   Results: We found that the landing angle and the maximum swing angle of diabetes patients with or without peripheral neuropathy were significantly less than those of the control group (P < 0.05). The walking speed of diabetes patients with peripheral neuropathy is significantly less than those of the control group (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study confirms that the wearable gait analysis system (Gaitboter) is an ideal system to identify abnormal gait in patients with type 2 diabetes and provides a new device and method for diabetes-related gait research.

AB  - In this study, a novel wearable system for the identification of compensatory trunk movements (CTMs) in post-stroke hemiplegic patients is presented. The device is composed of seven soft sensing elements (SSEs) based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology. Each SSE consists of a single FBG encapsulated into a flexible matrix to enhance the sensor's robustness and improve its compliance with the human body. The FBG's small size, light weight, multiplexing capability, and biocompatibility make the proposed wearable system suitable for multi-point measurements without any movement restriction. Firstly, its manufacturing process is presented, together with the SSEs' mechanical characterization to strain. Results of the metrological characterization showed a linear response of each SSE in the operating range. Then, the feasibility assessment of the proposed system is described. In particular, the device's capability of detecting CTMs was assessed on 10 healthy volunteers and eight hemiplegic patients while performing three tasks which are representative of typical everyday life actions. The wearable system showed good potential in detecting CTMs. This promising result may foster the use of the proposed device on post-stroke patients, aiming at assessing the proper course of the rehabilitation process both in clinical and domestic settings. Moreover, its use may aid in defining tailored strategies to improve post-stoke patients' motor recovery and quality of life.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia. Although there is no current cure, medical treatment can help to control its progression. Hence, early-stage diagnosis is crucial to maximize the living standards of the patients. Biochemical markers and medical imaging in combination with neuropsychological tests represent the most extended diagnosis procedure. However, these techniques require specialized personnel and long processing time. Furthermore, the access to some of these techniques is often limited in crowded healthcare systems and rural areas. In this context, electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique to obtain endogenous brain information, has been proposed for the diagnosis of early-stage AD. Despite the valuable information provided by clinical EEG and high density montages, these approaches are impractical in conditions such as those described above. Consequently, in this study, we evaluated the feasibly of using a reduced EEG montage with only four channels to detect early-stage AD. For this purpose, we involved eight clinically diagnosed AD patients and eight healthy controls. The results we obtained reveal similar accuracies (p-value=0.66) for the reduced montage (0.86) and a 16-channel montage (0.87). This suggests that a four-channel wearable EEG system could be an effective tool for supporting early-stage AD detection.

AB  - Background: Technological progress has enabled the provision of personalised feedback across multiple dimensions of physical activity that are important for health. Whether this multidimensional approach supports physical activity behaviour change has not yet been examined. Our objective was to examine the effectiveness of a novel digital system and app that provided multidimensional physical activity feedback combined with health trainer support in primary care patients identified as at risk of chronic disease.
   Methods: MIPACT was a parallel-group, randomised controlled trial that recruited patients at medium (>= 10 and < 20%) or high (>= 20%) risk of cardiovascular disease and/or type II diabetes from six primary care practices in the United Kingdom. Intervention group participants (n = 120) received personal multidimensional physical activity feedback using a customised digital system and web-app for 3 months plus five health trainer-led sessions. All participants received standardised information regarding physical activity. Control group participants (n = 84) received no further intervention. The primary outcome was device-based assessment of physical activity at 12 months.
   Results: Mean intervention effects were: moderate-vigorous physical activity: -1.1 (95% CI, - 17.9 to 15.7) min/day; moderate-vigorous physical activity in >= 10-min bouts: 0.2 (- 14.2 to 14.6) min/day; Physical Activity Level (PAL): 0.00 (- 0.036 to 0.054); vigorous physical activity: 1.8 (- 0.8 to 4.2) min/day; and sedentary time: 10 (- 19.3 to 39.3) min/ day. For all of these outcomes, the results showed that the groups were practically equivalent and statistically ruled out meaningful positive or negative effects (>minimum clinically important difference, MCID). However, there was profound physical activity multidimensionality, and only a small proportion (5%) of patients had consistently low physical activity across all dimensions.
   Conclusion: In patients at risk of cardiovascular disease and/or type II diabetes, MIPACT did not increase mean physical activity. Using a sophisticated multidimensional digital approach revealed enormous heterogeneity in baseline physical activity in primary care patients, and practitioners may need to screen for low physical activity across dimensions rather than rely on disease-risk algorithms that are heavily influenced by age.

AB  - Objective. Bimanual humanoid platforms for home assistance are nowadays available, both as academic prototypes and commercially. Although they are usually thought of as daily helpers for non-disabled users, their ability to move around, together with their dexterity, makes them ideal assistive devices for upper-limb disabled persons, too. Indeed, teleoperating a bimanual robotic platform via muscle activation could revolutionize the way stroke survivors, amputees and patients with spinal injuries solve their daily home chores. Moreover, with respect to direct prosthetic control, teleoperation has the advantage of freeing the user from the burden of the prosthesis itself, overpassing several limitations regarding size, weight, or integration, and thus enables a much higher level of functionality. Approach. In this study, nine participants, two of whom suffer from severe upper-limb disabilities, teleoperated a humanoid assistive platform, performing complex bimanual tasks requiring high precision and bilateral arm/hand coordination, simulating home/office chores. A wearable body posture tracker was used for position control of the robotic torso and arms, while interactive machine learning applied to electromyography of the forearms helped the robot to build an increasingly accurate model of the participant's intent over time. Main results. All participants, irrespective of their disability, were uniformly able to perform the demanded tasks. Completion times, subjective evaluation scores, as well as energy- and time- efficiency show improvement over time on short and long term. Significance. This is the first time a hybrid setup, involving myoeletric and inertial measurements, is used by disabled people to teleoperate a bimanual humanoid robot. The proposed setup, taking advantage of interactive machine learning, is simple, non-invasive, and offers a new assistive solution for disabled people in their home environment. Additionnally, it has the potential of being used in several other applications in which fine humanoid robot control is required.

AB  - Identifying transient and nonpersistent abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms by continuously monitoring the high-risk populations is of great importance for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. In recent years, fabric electrodes have been widely used in wearable devices because of their non-irritating properties and better comfort than traditional AgCl electrodes. However, the motion noise caused by the relative movement between the fabric electrodes and skin affects the quality of ECGs and reduces the accuracy of diagnosis. Therefore, delineating the ECG waveforms that are recorded from wearable devices with varying levels of noise is still challenging. In this study, a signal quality assessment (SQA)-based ECG waveform delineation method that is used for wearable systems was developed. The ECG signal was first preprocessed by a bandpass filter. Five indices, including the multiscale nonlinear amplitude statistical distribution (adSQI(1), adSQI(2)), the proportion of energy-related to T wave (ptSQI), and heart rates computed from R waves and T waves (rHR and tHR, respectively), were then calculated from the preprocessed ECG signal. The signals were classified as good, acceptable, and unacceptable ECGs by combining these indices through the use of a neural network. Subsequently, the R waves or/and T waves were identified for the corresponding feature interpretations based on the SQA results. ECGs that were recorded from the chest belts from 29 volunteers at different activity statuses were divided into 4-s segments. A total of 7133 manually labeled segments were used to derive (4985 segments) and validate (2148 segments) the algorithm. The adSQI(1), adSQI(2), tHR, and rHR characteristics were significantly different among the good, acceptable, and unacceptable ECGs. The ptSQI value was considerably higher in the good ECGs than in the acceptable and unacceptable ECGs. The ECG segments of different quality levels were classified with an accuracy of 96.74% by using the proposed SQA method. The R waves and T waves were identified with accuracies of 99.95% and 99.57%, respectively, for segments that were classified as acceptable and/or good. The SQA-based ECG waveform delineation method can perform reliable analysis and has the potential to be applied in wearable ECG systems for the early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - Background:People with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) are at elevated risk of severe, potentially hazardous, hypoglycemia and would benefit from a device alerting to hypoglycemia. Heart rate variability (HRV) changes with hypoglycemia due to sympathetic activity. Since IAH is associated with suppressed sympathetic activity, we investigated whether hypoglycemia elicits a measurable change in HRV in patients with T1D and IAH. Method:Eligible participants underwent a modified hyperinsulinemic euglycemic hypoglycemic clamp (glucose nadir, 43.1 +/- 0.90 mg/dl), while HRV was measured by a VitalConnect HealthPatch. Measurements of HRV included Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) and low to high frequency (LF:HF) ratio. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for testing within-subject HRV changes. Results:We included 12 participants (8 female, mean age 57 +/- 12 years, mean HbA1c 57 +/- 5 mmol/mol (7.4 +/- 0.4%)). Symptoms increased from 4.0 (1.5-7.0) at euglycemia to 7.5 (5.0-11.0) during hypoglycemia (P = .003). In response to hypoglycemia, the LF:HF ratio and RMSSD increased when normalized for data obtained during euglycemia (both P < .01). The LF:HF ratio increased in 6 participants (50%) and declined in one other participant (8%). The RMSSD decreased in 3 (25%) and increased in 4 (33%) participants. In 2 patients, no change in HRV could be detected in response to hypoglycemia. Conclusions:This study reveals that hypoglycemia-induced changes in HRV are retained in the majority of people with T1D and IAH, and that these changes can be detected by a wearable device. Real-time HRV seems usable for detection of hypoglycemia in patients with IAH.

AB  - Wireless body sensors are increasingly used by clinicians and researchers in a wide range of applications, such as sports, space engineering, and medicine. Monitoring vital signs in real time can dramatically increase diagnosis accuracy and enable automatic curing procedures, e.g., detect and stop epilepsy or narcolepsy seizures. Breathing parameters are critical in oxygen therapy, hospital, and ambulatory monitoring, while the assessment of cough severity is essential when dealing with several diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In this paper, a low-power wireless respiratory monitoring system with cough detection is proposed to measure the breathing rate and the frequency of coughing. This system uses wearable wireless multimodal patch sensors, designed using off-the-shelf components. These wearable sensors use a low-power nine-axis inertial measurement unit to quantify the respiratory movement and a MEMs microphone to record audio signals. Data processing and fusion algorithms are used to calculate the respiratory frequency and the coughing events. The architecture of each wireless patch-sensor is presented. In fact, the results show that the small 26.67 x 65.53 mm(2) patch-sensor consumes around 12-16.2 mA and can last at least 6 h with a miniature 100-mA lithium ion battery. The data processing algorithms, the acquisition, and wireless communication units are described. The proposed network performance is presented for experimental tests with a freely behaving user in parallel with the gold standard respiratory inductance plethysmography.

AB  - Hand paralysis is one of the most common complications in stroke patients, which severely impacts their daily lives. This article presents a wearable hand rehabilitation system that supports both mirror therapy and task-oriented therapy. A pair of gloves, i.e., a sensory glove and a motor glove, was designed and fabricated with a soft, flexible material, providing greater comfort and safety than conventional rigid rehabilitation devices. The sensory glove worn on the nonaffected hand, which contains the force and flex sensors, is used to measure the gripping force and bending angle of each finger joint for motion detection. The motor glove, driven by micromotors, provides the affected hand with assisted driving force to perform training tasks. Machine learning is employed to recognize the gestures from the sensory glove and to facilitate the rehabilitation tasks for the affected hand. The proposed system offers 16 kinds of finger gestures with an accuracy of 93.32x0025;, allowing patients to conduct mirror therapy using fine-grained gestures for training a single finger and multiple fingers in coordination. A more sophisticated task-oriented rehabilitation with mirror therapy is also presented, which offers six types of training tasks with an average accuracy of 89.4x0025; in real time.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of innovative healthcare methods, including remote patient monitoring. In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning within a continuous remote patient monitoring system.

AB  - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is currently the third major cause of death -- more than three million people died from it in 2019. Given that COPD cannot be cured currently, immediate treatment is crucial. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is widely used to prevent COPD deterioration. Patients are advised to undergo a PR at home to get sufficient treatment in time. Monitoring patients during home rehabilitation can help not only improve patient adherence but also collect data on patients' recovery progress from rehabilitation team's perspective. However, how to track if proper diaphragmatic breathing, an essential part of PR, is taken by a patient has remained challenging. The current monitoring solution still appears obtrusive as it requires the patient to wear two uncomfortable respiration belts. Alternatively, therapists need to monitor the patients remotely through several cameras, which consumes substantial medical resources and causes privacy issues.
   In this work, we present BreathMentor, a smart speaker based diaphragmatic breathing monitoring system targeting early COPD stages I and II. BreathMentor is both unobtrusive and preventive of privacy invasion, so that it can solve the existing pain points and suits home care. BreathMentor converts the smart speaker into an active sonar system that continuously perceives and analyses the changes in surroundings, thereby detecting the user's respiration rate, deriving the breathing phases, and classifying whether the patient is practising diaphragmatic breathing. BreathMentor formulates breathing monitoring as a Temporal Action Localization task that enables us to detect each breathing cycle and classify its type. Our key insight is that breathing periodicity and phase duration are natural properties to localize and segment the breaths. Our key design to classify the breathing type is a hybrid architecture encompassing signal processing and deep learning techniques. Further, we evaluate the system performance on fifteen healthy subjects who would not breathe abnormally during diaphragmatic breathing under the supervision of therapists. In conclusion, BreathMentor can achieve robust performance for monitoring diaphragmatic breathing in different environments, as demonstrated in the results. The median error rate of respiration detection is 0.2 BPM, and the I/E ratio derivation is accurate with a mean absolute percentage error of less than 5.9% for breathing phase detection, together with a recall of 98.2%, and a precision of 95.5% in detecting diaphragmatic breathing. Above results indicate that BreathMentor can be used to track the patients' adherence and help monitor their breathing capacity.

AB  - Introduction Existing mobility endpoints based on functional performance, physical assessments and patient self-reporting are often affected by lack of sensitivity, limiting their utility in clinical practice. Wearable devices including inertial measurement units (IMUs) can overcome these limitations by quantifying digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) both during supervised structured assessments and in real-world conditions. The validity of IMU-based methods in the real-world, however, is still limited in patient populations. Rigorous validation procedures should cover the device metrological verification, the validation of the algorithms for the DMOs computation specifically for the population of interest and in daily life situations, and the users' perspective on the device. Methods and analysis This protocol was designed to establish the technical validity and patient acceptability of the approach used to quantify digital mobility in the real world by Mobilise-D, a consortium funded by the European Union (EU) as part of the Innovative Medicine Initiative, aiming at fostering regulatory approval and clinical adoption of DMOs. After defining the procedures for the metrological verification of an IMU-based device, the experimental procedures for the validation of algorithms used to calculate the DMOs are presented. These include laboratory and real-world assessment in 120 participants from five groups: healthy older adults; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, proximal femoral fracture and congestive heart failure. DMOs extracted from the monitoring device will be compared with those from different reference systems, chosen according to the contexts of observation. Questionnaires and interviews will evaluate the users' perspective on the deployed technology and relevance of the mobility assessment. Ethics and dissemination The study has been granted ethics approval by the centre's committees (London-Bloomsbury Research Ethics committee; Helsinki Committee, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Centre; Medical Faculties of The University of Tubingen and of the University of Kiel). Data and algorithms will be made publicly available.

AB  - Background: Abnormal prolongation or shortening of the QT interval is associated with increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. For continuous monitoring, widespread use, and prevention of cardiac events, advanced wearable technologies are emerging as promising surrogates for conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval assessment. Previous studies have shown a good agreement between QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals measured on a smartwatch ECG and a 12-lead ECG, but the clinical accuracy of computerized algorithms for QT and QTc interval measurement from smartwatch ECGs is unclear.
   Objective: The prospective observational study compared the smartwatch-recorded QT and QTc assessed using AccurKardia's AccurBeat platform with the conventional 12-lead ECG annotated manually by a cardiologist.
   Methods: ECGs were collected from healthy participants (without any known cardiovascular disease) aged >22 years. Two consecutive 30-second ECG readings followed by (within 15 minutes) a 10-second standard 12-lead ECG were recorded for each participant. Characteristics of the participants were compared by sex using a 2-sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical comparisons of heart rate (HR), QT interval, and QTc interval between the platform and the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II were done using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. Linear regression was used to predict QTc and QT intervals from the ECG based on the platform's QTc/QT intervals with adjustment for age, sex, and difference in HR measurement. The Bland-Altman method was used to check agreement between various QT and QTc interval measurements.
   Results: A total of 50 participants (32 female, mean age 46 years, SD 1 year) were included in the study. The result of the regression model using the platform measurements to predict the 12-lead ECG measurements indicated that, in univariate analysis, QT/QTc intervals from the platform significantly predicted QT/QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II, and this remained significant after adjustment for sex, age, and change in HR. The Bland-Altman plot results found that 96% of the average QTc interval measurements between the platform and QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% confidence limit of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of -10.5 (95% limits of agreement -71.43, 50.43). A total of 94% of the average QT interval measurements between the platform and the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% CI of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of -6.3 (95% limits of agreement -54.54, 41.94).
   Conclusions: QT and QTc intervals obtained by a smartwatch coupled with the platform's assessment were comparable to those from a 12-lead ECG. Accordingly, with further refinements, remote monitoring using this technology holds promise for the identification of QT interval prolongation.

AB  - With the innovation of technologies such as sensors and artificial intelligence, some nursing homes use wearable devices to monitor the movement and physiological indicators of the elderly and provide prompts for any health risks. Nevertheless, this kind of risk warning is a decision based on a particular physiological indicator. Therefore, such decisions cannot effectively predict health risks. To achieve this goal, we propose a model Lidom (A LightGBM-based Disease Prediction Model) based on the combination of the LightGBM algorithm, InterpretML framework, and sequence confrontation network (SeqGAN). The Lidom model first solves the problem of uneven samples based on the sequence confrontation network (SeqGAN), then trains the model based on the LightGBM algorithm, uses the InterpretML framework for analysis, and finally obtains the best model. This paper uses the public dataset MIMIC-III, subject data, and the early diabetes risk prediction dataset in UCI as sample data. The experimental results show that the Lidom model has an accuracy rate of 93.46% for disease risk prediction and an accuracy rate of 99.8% for early diabetes risk prediction. The results show that the Lidom model can provide adequate support for the prediction of the health risks of the elderly.

AB  - Background It was recently demonstrated that the detection of atrial fibrillation based on heart rate tracking by optical sensors is feasible and reliable using the Apple Watch and the corresponding application. There are already a number of smartwatches and other wearable devices alongside the Apple Watch that can additionally record a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and it is reasonable to expect this technology to become a standard feature, as is already the case with automated heart rate tracking. This could potentially have enormous impact regarding the early diagnosis of several cardiac diseases.
   Case summary A 61-year-old male patient without previously known coronary artery disease was admitted with subacute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) caused by occlusion of left anterior descending artery. Due to mildness of symptoms, the patient did only seek medical attention due to morphological changes in the single-lead ECG tracing acquired on his Apple Watch 5. The ECG recording of his smartwatch clearly showed ST-elevation, QRS widening, R-wave loss, and T-wave inversion. Coronary angiography revealed occlusion of the left anterior descending and recanalization was performed. The patient recovered without any complications and was discharged from the hospital 4 days after admission.
   Discussion While the potential of ECG recordings by smartwatches to detect atrial fibrillation is currently under scientific investigation, this case highlights the possible potential of these devices to detect STEMI.

AB  - Background: QTc interval monitoring, for the prevention of drug-induced arrhythmias is necessary, especially in the context of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For the provision of widespread use, surrogates for 12-lead ECG QTc assessment may be useful. This prospective observational study compared QTc duration assessed by artificial intelligence (AI-QTc) (Cardiologs?, Paris, France) on smartwatch single-lead electrocardiograms (SWECGs) with those measured on 12-lead ECGs, in patients with early stage COVID-19 treated with a hydroxychloroquine?azithromycin regimen. Methods: Consecutive patients with COVID-19 who needed hydroxychloroquine?azithromycin therapy, received a smartwatch (Withings Move ECG?, Withings, France). At baseline, day-6 and day-10, a 12-lead ECG was recorded, and a SW-ECG was transmitted thereafter. Throughout the drug regimen, a SW-ECG was transmitted every morning at rest. Agreement between manual QTc measurement on a 12-lead ECG and AI-QTc on the corresponding SW-ECG was assessed by the Bland-Altman method. Results: 85 patients (30 men, mean age 38.3 ? 12.2 years) were included in the study. Fair agreement between manual and AI-QTc values was observed, particularly at day-10, where the delay between the 12-lead ECG and the SW-ECG was the shortest (?2.6 ? 64.7 min): 407 ? 26 ms on the 12-lead ECG vs 407 ? 22 ms on SWECG, bias ?1 ms, limits of agreement ?46 ms to +45 ms; the difference between the two measures was <50 ms in 98.2% of patients. Conclusion: In real-world epidemic conditions, AI-QTc duration measured by SW-ECG is in fair agreement with manual measurements on 12-lead ECGs. Following further validation, AI-assisted SW-ECGs may be suitable for QTc interval monitoring. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrial.gov NCT04371744.

AB  - The unavailability of appropriate mechanisms for timely detection of diseases and successive treatment causes the death of a large number of people around the globe. The timely diagnosis of grave diseases like different forms of cancer and other life-threatening diseases can save a valuable life or at least extend the life span of an afflicted individual. The advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled healthcare technologies can provide effective medical facilities to the population and contribute greatly towards the recuperation of patients. The usage of IoMT in the diagnosis and study of histopathological images can enable real-time identification of diseases and corresponding remedial actions can be taken to save an affected individual. This can be achieved by the use of imaging apparatus with the capacity of auto-analysis of captured images. However, most deep learning-based image classifying models are bulk in size and are inappropriate for use in IoT based imaging devices. The objective of this research work is to design a deep learning-based lightweight model suitable for histopathological image analysis with appreciable accuracy. This paper presents a novel lightweight deep learning-based model "ReducedFireNet", for auto-classification of histopathological images. The proposed method attained a mean accuracy of 96.88% and an F1 score of 0.968 on evaluating an actual histopathological image data set. The results are encouraging, considering the complexity of histopathological images. In addition to the high accuracy the lightweight design (size in few KBs) of the ReducedFireNet model, makes it suitable for IoMT imaging equipment. The simulation results show the proposed model has computational requirement of 0.201 GFLOPS and has a mere size of only 0.391 MB.

AB  - The rising prevalence and global burden of diabetes fortify the need for more comprehensive and effective management to prevent, monitor, and treat diabetes and its complications. Applying artificial intelligence in complimenting the diagnosis, management, and prediction of the diabetes trajectory has been increasingly common over the years. This study aims to illustrate an inclusive landscape of application of artificial intelligence in diabetes through a bibliographic analysis and offers future direction for research. Bibliometrics analysis was combined with exploratory factor analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation to uncover emergent research domains and topics related to artificial intelligence and diabetes. Data were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. The results showed a rising trend in the number of papers and citations concerning AI applications in diabetes, especially since 2010. The nucleus driving the research and development of AI in diabetes is centered around developed countries, mainly consisting of the United States, which contributed 44.1% of the publications. Our analyses uncovered the top five emerging research domains to be: (i) use of artificial intelligence in diagnosis of diabetes, (ii) risk assessment of diabetes and its complications, (iii) role of artificial intelligence in novel treatments and monitoring in diabetes, (iv) application of telehealth and wearable technology in the daily management of diabetes, and (v) robotic surgical outcomes with diabetes as a comorbid. Despite the benefits of artificial intelligence, challenges with system accuracy, validity, and confidentiality breach will need to be tackled before being widely applied for patients' benefits.

AB  - Purpose: Patch-like wearable insulin delivery devices are gaining acceptance as a treatment modality for insulin delivery in patients with diabetes. These devices aim to simplify and optimize insulin delivery while reducing barriers associated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen. As clinicians aim to learn more about this method of insulin delivery, real-world evidence can provide insight for patient identification and treatment guidance. This study was performed to evaluate the change in glycemic control (A1C) and insulin total daily dose (TDD) after switching to V-Go wearable insulin delivery device in a type 2 diabetes population with suboptimal control using conventional insulin delivery regimens.
   Patients and Methods: Electronic health records were queried to identify patients meeting inclusion criteria. Study objectives evaluated change in A1C and insulin TDD compared to baseline. A total of 283 patients were enrolled across 9 diabetes specialty sites.
   Results: A1C significantly decreased from baseline at 3 months (-1.01% +/- 0.09; P=0.0001) and 7 months (-1.04% +/- 0.10; P<0.0001) after switching to V-Go. TDD of insulin significantly decreased at 3 months (-17 +/- 3 U/day; P<0.0001) and 7 months (-14 +/- 3 U/day; P<0.0001). Stratifying by prescribed baseline insulin regimen (basal-bolus, basal only or premix) or diabetes duration (<5 years to >20 years) demonstrated significant glycemic improvements from baseline with V-Go regardless of baseline regimen or duration of diabetes. After 7 months of V-Go use, the percent of patients considered high risk (A1C >9.0%) was reduced by nearly half (46% to 24%), and 52% of patients overall achieved an A1C <8%.
   Conclusion: This study represents the largest real-world study of the effectiveness of V-Go in patients with type 2 diabetes. Significant improvements in glycemic control with a reduction in insulin utilization were achieved across varying baseline insulin regimens and regardless of diabetes duration supporting the clinical benefits of this patch-like wearable insulin delivery device.

AB  - Recently, deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been widely used in the healthcare monitoring system for decision making. Disease prediction is one of the emerging applications in current practices. In the method described in this paper, lung cancer prediction is implemented using deep learning and IoT, which is a challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Because lung cancer is a dangerous medical disease that must be identified at a higher detection rate, disease-related information is obtained from IoT medical devices and transmitted to the server. The medical data are then processed and classified into two categories, benign and malignant, using a multi-layer CNN (ML-CNN) model. In addition, a particle swarm optimization method is used to improve the learning ability (loss and accuracy). This step uses medical data (CT scan and sensor information) based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For this purpose, sensor information and image information from IoMT devices and sensors are gathered, and then classification actions are taken. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with well-known existing methods, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and conventional CNN, in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and computation time. For this purpose, two lung datasets were tested to evaluate the performance: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS) datasets. Compared to alternative methods, the trial outcomes showed that the suggested technique has the potential to help the radiologist make an accurate and efficient early lung cancer diagnosis. The performance of the proposed ML-CNN was analyzed using Python, where the accuracy (2.5-10.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, precision (2.3-9.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, sensitivity (2.4-12.5%) was high when compared to several instances, the F-score (2-30%) was high when compared to the number of cases, the error rate (0.7-11.5%) was low compared to the number of cases, and the computation time (170 ms to 400 ms) was low compared to how many cases were computed for the proposed work, including previous known methods. The proposed ML-CNN architecture shows that this technique outperforms previous works.

AB  - The purpose of this exploratory study was to determine whether liver dysfunction can be generally classified using a wearable electronic nose based on semiconductor metal oxide (MOx) gas sensors, and whether the extent of this dysfunction can be quantified. MOx gas sensors are attractive because of their simplicity, high sensitivity, low cost, and stability. A total of 30 participants were enrolled, 10 of them being healthy controls, 10 with compensated cirrhosis, and 10 with decompensated cirrhosis. We used three sensor modules with a total of nine different MOx layers to detect reducible, easily oxidizable, and highly oxidizable gases. The complex data analysis in the time and non-linear dynamics domains is based on the extraction of 10 features from the sensor time series of the extracted breathing gas measurement cycles. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for distinguishing compensated and decompensated cirrhosis patients from healthy controls was 1.00. Patients with compensated and decompensated cirrhosis could be separated with a sensitivity of 0.90 (correctly classified decompensated cirrhosis), a specificity of 1.00 (correctly classified compensated cirrhosis), and an accuracy of 0.95. Our wearable, non-invasive system provides a promising tool to detect liver dysfunctions on a functional basis. Therefore, it could provide valuable support in preoperative examinations or for initial diagnosis by the general practitioner, as it provides non-invasive, rapid, and cost-effective analysis results.

AB  - Background: Wearable cardioverter-defibrillators (WCDs) are a well-established tool to bridge the recovery time of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) until the implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), as recommended by the current guidelines. Besides their function to detect and treat malignant arrhythmias, WCDs may be used as a telemonitoring system. In this study, we sought to illustrate and discuss the telemonitoring potential of WCDs and to analyze physical activity in specific patient cohorts. Methods and Results: We retrospectively included 140 patients with reduced LVEF who were prescribed WCDs in our clinic. We analyzed the patients' physical activity (n = 105 with a WCD compliance above 21 h/day), body position and resting position. We found a reduced physical activity in women and in patients over the age of 65 compared to younger patients. Furthermore, the patients who were overweight or obese showed significantly reduced physical activity compared to the patients with a normal weight (6365 +/- 3572 vs. 4972 +/- 2476 vs. 7045 +/- 3521, p = 0.02). Conclusion: WCDs may be used as a telemonitoring and intervention tool in patients with reduced LVEF. Specific patient groups may benefit from guidance from their treating physician regarding physical activity.

AB  - NH3 gas in human exhaled breath contains abundant physiological information related to human health, especially chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, up to now, most wearable NH3 sensors show inevitable defects (low sensitivity, easy to be interfered by the environment, etc.), which may lead to misdiagnosis of CKD. To solve the above dilemma, a nanoporous, heterogeneous, and dual-signal (optical and electrical) wearable NH3 sensor mask is developed successfully. More specifically, a polyacrylonitrile/ bromocresol green (PAN/BCG) nanofiber film as a visual NH3 sensor and a polyacrylonitrile/polyaniline/reduced graphene oxide (PAN/PANI/rGO) nanofiber film as a resistive NH3 sensor are constructed. Due to the high specific surface area and abundant NH3 binding sites of these two nanofiber films, they exhibit good NH3 sensing performance. However, although the visual NH3 sensor (PAN/BCG nanofiber film) is simple without the need of any detecting facilities and quite stable when temperature and humidity change, it shows poor sensitivity and resolution. In comparison, the resistive NH3 sensor (PAN/PANI/rGO nanofiber film) is of high sensitivity, fast response, and good resolution, but its electrical signal is easily interfered by the external environment (such as humidity, temperature, etc.). Considering that the sensing principles between a visual NH3 sensor and resistive NH3 sensor are significantly different, a wearable dual-signal NH3 sensor containing both a visual NH3 sensor and resistive NH3 sensor is further explored. Our data prove that the two sensing signals in this dual-signal NH3 sensor mask can not only work well without interference with each other but also complement each other to improve the sensing accuracy, indicating its potential application in non-invasive diagnosis of CKD.

This research identified a viable classification model and feature selector (CM-FS) combination for separating aggressive from non-aggressive movements using smartwatch data and determined if only one smartwatch is sufficient for this task. A ranking method was used to select relevant CM-FS models across accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The Waikato environment for knowledge analysis (WEKA) was used to run 6 machine learning classifiers (random forest, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), multilayer perceptron neural network (MP), support vector machine, naive Bayes, decision tree) coupled with three feature selectors (ReliefF, InfoGain, Correlation). Microsoft Band 2 accelerometer and gyroscope data were collected during an activity circuit that included aggressive (punching, shoving, slapping, shaking) and non-aggressive (clapping hands, waving, handshaking, opening/closing a door, typing on a keyboard) tasks. A combination of kNN and ReliefF was the best CM-FS model for separating aggressive actions from non-aggressive actions, with 99.6% accuracy, 98.4% sensitivity, 99.8% specificity, 98.9% precision, 0.987 F-score, and 0.984 MCC. kNN and random forest classifiers, combined with any of the feature selectors, generated the top models. Models with naive Bayes or support vector machines had poor performance for sensitivity, F-score, and MCC. Wearing the smartwatch on the dominant wrist produced the best single-watch results. The kNN and ReliefF combination demonstrated that this smartwatch-based approach is a viable solution for identifying aggressive behavior. This wrist-based wearable sensor approach could be used by care providers in settings where people suffer from dementia or mental health disorders, where random aggressive behaviors often occur.

AB  - Wireless body sensor network (WBSN) is also known as wearable sensors with transmission capabilities, computation, storage and sensing. In this paper, a supervised learning based decision support system for multi sensor (MS) healthcare data from wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) is proposed. Here, data fusion ensemble scheme is developed along with medical data which is obtained from body sensor networks. Ensemble classifier is taken the fusion data as an input for heart disease prediction. Feature selection is done by the squirrel search algorithm which is used to remove the irrelevant features. From the sensor activity data, we utilized the modified deep belief network (M-DBN) for the prediction of heart diseases. This work is implemented by Python platform and the performance is carried out of both proposed and existing methods. Our proposed M-DBN technique is compared with various existing techniques such as Deep Belief Network, Artificial Neural Network and Conventional Neural Network. The performance of accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, false positive rate, false negative and true negative are taken for both proposed and existing methods. Our proposed performance values for accuracy (95%), precision (98%), and recall (90%), F1 score (93%), false positive (72%), false negative (98%) and true negative (98%).

AB  - Clinical studies have shown that speech pauses can reflect the cognitive function differences between Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and non-AD patients, while the value of pause information in AD detection has not been fully explored. Herein, we propose a speech pause feature extraction and encoding strategy for only acoustic-signal-based AD detection. First, a voice activity detection (VAD) method was constructed to detect pause/non-pause feature and encode it to binary pause sequences that are easier to calculate. Then, an ensemble machine-learning-based approach was proposed for the classification of AD from the participants' spontaneous speech, based on the VAD Pause feature sequence and common acoustic feature sets (ComParE and eGeMAPS). The proposed pause feature sequence was verified in five machine-learning models. The validation data included two public challenge datasets (ADReSS and ADReSSo, English voice) and a local dataset (10 audio recordings containing five patients and five controls, Chinese voice). Results showed that the VAD Pause feature was more effective than common feature sets (ComParE: 6373 features and eGeMAPS: 88 features) for AD classification, and that the ensemble method improved the accuracy by more than 5% compared to several baseline methods (8% on the ADReSS dataset; 5.9% on the ADReSSo dataset). Moreover, the pause-sequence-based AD detection method could achieve 80% accuracy on the local dataset. Our study further demonstrated the potential of pause information in speech-based AD detection, and also contributed to a more accessible and general pause feature extraction and encoding method for AD detection.

AB  - Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. Although targeted screening programs using mammography have facilitated earlier detection and improved treatment has resulted in a significant reduction in mortality, some negative aspects related to cost, the availability of trained staff, the duration of the procedure, and its non-generalizability to all women must be taken into consideration. Breast palpation is a simple non-invasive procedure that can be performed by lay individuals for detecting possible malignant nodules in the breast. It is a simple test, based on the haptic perception of different stiffness between healthy and abnormal tissues. According to a survey we carried out, despite being safe and simple, breast self-examination is not carried by women because they are not confident of their ability to detect a lump. In this study, a non-invasive wearable device designed to mimic the process of breast self-examination using pressure sensing textiles and thus increase the confidence and self-awareness of women is proposed. Combined with other screening methods, the device can increase the odds of early detection for better prognosis. Here, we present the physical implementation of the device and a finite element analysis of the mechanics underlying its working principle. Characterization of the device using models of large and medium breast phantoms with rigid inclusions demonstrates that it can detect nodules in much the same way as does the human hand during breast self-examination.

AB  - Diabetes is considered among the major critical health conditions (chronic disease) around the world. This is due the fact that Glucose level could change drastically and lead to critical conditions reaching to death in some advance cases. To prevent this issues, diabetes patient are always advised to monitor their glucose level at least three times a day. Fingertip pricking - as the traditional method for glucose level tracking - leads patients to be distress and it might infect the skin. In some cases, tracking the glucose level might be a hard job especially if the patient is a child, senior, or even have several other health issues. In this paper, an optimum solution to this drawback by adopting the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)-based non-invasive strategies has been proposed. Near-Infrared (NIR) -as an optical method of the non-invasive technique - has been adopted to help diabetic patients in continuously monitoring their blood without pain. The proposed solution will alert the patients' parents or guardians of their situation when they about to reach critical conditions specially at night by sending alarms and notifications by Short Messages (SMS) along with the patients current location to up to three people. Moreover, a Machine Learning (ML) model is implemented to predict future events where the patient might have serious issues. This model prediction is best practice in this chronic health domain as it has never been implemented to predicted a future forecast of the patient chart. Multivariate Time-Series data set (i.e. AIM '94) has been used to train the proposed ML model. The collected data shows a high level of accuracy when predicting serious critical conditions in Glucose levels.

AB  - In the medical field, several resources of big data like patient medical reports, hospital information, information on diagnostic tests, and data on IoT (Internet of Things)-based smart medical devices form a vast asset to future analysis. Big data produced and recorded in the field of biomedical research are primarily relevant to comprehensive health services. Due to the enormous quantity of storage, appropriate administration, and computing resources, big data demands the most effective and advance data analytical tool. Thus, most of the robust algorithms or tools used to get insights from large datasets, especially to analyze, are from the Machine Learning (ML) domain. Numerous academicians and researchers have suggested ML techniques to medical-oriented data analytics in recent times to increase the accuracy of assessments. Though most of the existing approaches were employed independently and retrieved an acceptable outcome, they still lacked optimal accuracy. To improve accuracy, this article presents an ensemble learning strategy wherein the outcomes of two ML algorithms, namely 'Edge Detection Instance preference (EDIP)' and 'Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost)' are integrated. For aggregating precision, the voting technique is utilized. As a consequence of these findings, it is determined that the proposed learning technique achieves the highest level of accuracy when compared with the existing methods. The ensemble learning attains a better accuracy rate for all the four tested datasets, namely, blood cancer (98.43%), liver cancer (97.47%), heart disease (96.34%), and diabetes (98.14%).

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) includes interconnected sensors, wearable devices, medical devices, and clinical systems. At the same time, skin cancer is a commonly available type of cancer that exists all over the globe. This study projects a new segmentation based classification model for skin lesion diagnosis by combining a GrabCut algorithm and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy classifier (ANFC) model. The proposed method involves four main steps: preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Initially, the preprocessing step is carried out using a Top hat filter and inpainting technique. Then, the Grabcut algorithm is used to segment the preprocessed images. Next, the feature extraction process takes place by the use of a deep learning based Inception model. Finally, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy classifier (ANFC) system gets executed to classify the dermoscopic images into different classes. The proposed model is simulated using a benchmark International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset and the results are examined interms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The proposed model exhibits better identification and classification of skin cancer. For examining the effective outcome of the projected technique, an extensive comparison of the presented method with earlier models takes place. The experimental values indicated that the proposed method has offered a maximum sensitivity of 93.40%, specificity of 98.70% and accuracy of 97.91%.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technology has recently been applied in healthcare systems as an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect sensor information for the diagnosis and prognosis of heart disease. The main objective of the proposed research is to classify data and predict heart disease using medical data and medical images. The proposed model is a medical data classification and prediction model that operates in two stages. If the result from the first stage is efficient in predicting heart disease, there is no need for stage two. In the first stage, data gathered from medical sensors affixed to the patient's body were classified; then, in stage two, echocardiogram image classification was performed for heart disease prediction. A hybrid linear discriminant analysis with the modified ant lion optimization (HLDA-MALO) technique was used for sensor data classification, while a hybrid Faster R-CNN with SE-ResNet-101 modelwass used for echocardiogram image classification. Both classification methods were carried out, and the classification findings were consolidated and validated to predict heart disease. The HLDA-MALO method obtained 96.85% accuracy in detecting normal sensor data, and 98.31% accuracy in detecting abnormal sensor data. The proposed hybrid Faster R-CNN with SE-ResNeXt-101 transfer learning model performed better in classifying echocardiogram images, with 98.06% precision, 98.95% recall, 96.32% specificity, a 99.02% F-score, and maximum accuracy of 99.15%.

AB  - Non-coordinated physical activity may lead to hypoglycemia, which is a dangerous condition for diabetic people. Decision support systems related to type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) still lack the capability of automated therapy modification by recognizing and categorizing the physical activity. Further, this desired adaptive therapy should be achieved without increasing the administrative load, which is already high for the diabetic community. These requirements can be satisfied by using artificial intelligence-based solutions, signals collected by wearable devices, and relying on the already available data sources, such as continuous glucose monitoring systems. In this work, we focus on the detection of physical activity by using a continuous glucose monitoring system and a wearable sensor providing the heart rate-the latter is accessible even in the cheapest wearables. Our results show that the detection of physical activity is possible based on these data sources, even if only low-complexity artificial intelligence models are deployed. In general, our models achieved approximately 90% accuracy in the detection of physical activity.

AB  - In today's healthcare setting, the accurate and timely diagnosis of breast cancer is critical for recovery and treatment in the early stages. In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has experienced a transformation that allows the analysis of real-time and historical data using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches. Medical IoT combines medical devices and AI applications with healthcare infrastructure to support medical diagnostics. The current state-of-the-art approach fails to diagnose breast cancer in its initial period, resulting in the death of most women. As a result, medical professionals and researchers are faced with a tremendous problem in early breast cancer detection. We propose a medical IoT-based diagnostic system that competently identifies malignant and benign people in an IoT environment to resolve the difficulty of identifying early-stage breast cancer. The artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization are used for malignant vs. benign classification, while the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were utilized as baseline classifiers for comparison. Hyperparameters are important for machine learning algorithms since they directly control the behaviors of training algorithms and have a significant effect on the performance of machine learning models. We employ a particle swarm optimization (PSO) feature selection approach to select more satisfactory features from the breast cancer dataset to enhance the classification performance using MLP and SVM, while grid-based search was used to find the best combination of the hyperparameters of the CNN and ANN models. The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset was used to test the proposed approach. The proposed model got a classification accuracy of 98.5% using CNN, and 99.2% using ANN.

AB  - The emerging technology breakthrough of the Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to offer promising solutions for indoor/outdoor healthcare, which may contribute significantly to human health and well-being. In this paper, we investigated the technologies of healthcare service applications in telemedicine architecture. We aimed to resolve a series of healthcare problems on the frequent failures in telemedicine architecture through IoT solutions, particularly the failures of wearable body sensors (Tier 1) and a medical center server (Tier 3). For improved generalisability, we demonstrated an effective research approach, the fault-tolerant framework on mHealth or the so-called FTF-mHealth-IoT in the context of IoT, to resolve essential problems in current investigations on healthcare services. First, we propose a risk local triage algorithm known as the risk-level localization triage (RLLT), which can exclude the control process of patient triage from the medical center by using mHealth and can warn about failures related to wearable sensors. RLLT performs this initial step towards detecting a patient's emergency case and then identifying the healthcare service package of the risk-level. Second, according to the risk-level package, our framework can aid decision makers in hospital selection through multi-criteria decision making (MCDM). Accordingly, mHealth can connect directly with the servers of distributed hospitals to ascertain available healthcare services for the risk-level package in those hospitals. The time of arrival of the patient at the hospital (TAH) is considered for each hospital to reach a final decision and select the appropriate institution in case of medical center failure. This paper used two datasets. The first dataset involved 572 patients with chronic heart disease. Their triage levels were evaluated using our RLLT algorithm. The second dataset included hospital healthcare services with two levels of availability within distributed hospitals to show variety when testing the proposed framework. The former dataset is an actual dataset of services collected from 12 hospitals located in the capital Baghdad, which represents the maximum level of availability. The latter is an assumption dataset of the services within the 12 hospitals located in the capital Kuala Lumpur, which represents the minimum level of availability. Subsequently, the hospitals were prioritized using a unique MCDM method for estimating small power consumption, namely, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), based on a crossover between the "healthcare services package/TAH'' of each hospital and the "hospital list''. The results showed that the AHP is effective for solving hospital selection problems within mHealth. The implications of this study support the patients, organizations, and medical staff in a modern lifestyle.

AB  - Background: Continuous surveillance helps people with diabetes live better lives. A wide range of technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), modern communications, and artificial intelligence (AI), can assist in lowering the expense of health services. Due to numerous communication systems, it is now possible to provide customized and distant healthcare. Main problem: Healthcare data grows daily, making storage and processing challenging. We provide intelligent healthcare structures for smart e-health apps to solve the aforesaid problem. The 5G network must offer advanced healthcare services to meet important requirements like large bandwidth and excellent energy efficacy. Methodology: This research suggested an intelligent system for diabetic patient tracking based on machine learning (ML). The architectural components comprised smartphones, sensors, and smart devices, to gather body dimensions. Then, the preprocessed data is normalized using the normalization procedure. To extract features, we use linear discriminant analysis (LDA). To establish a diagnosis, the intelligent system conducted data classification utilizing the suggested advanced-spatial-vector-based Random Forest (ASV-RF) in conjunction with particle swarm optimization (PSO). Results: Compared to other techniques, the simulation's outcomes demonstrate that the suggested approach offers greater accuracy.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization, heart disease is the biggest cause of death worldwide. It may be possible to bring down the overall death rate of individuals if cardiovascular disease can be detected in its earlier stages. If the cardiac disease is detected at an earlier stage, there is a greater possibility that it may be successfully treated and managed under the guidance of a physician. Recent advances in areas such as the Internet of Things, cloud storage, and machine learning have given rise to renewed optimism over the capacity of technology to bring about a paradigm change on a global scale. At the bedside, the use of sensors to capture vital signs has grown increasingly commonplace in recent years. Patients are manually monitored using a monitor located at the patient's bedside; there is no automatic data processing taking place. These results, which came from an investigation of cardiovascular disease carried out across a large number of hospitals, have been used in the development of a protocol for the early, automated, and intelligent identification of heart disorders. The PASCAL data set is prepared by collecting data from different hospitals using the digital stethoscope. This data set is publicly available, and it is used by many researchers around the world in experimental work. The proposed strategy for doing research includes three steps. The first stage is known as the data collection phase, the data is collected using biosensors and IoT devices through wireless sensor networks. In the second step, all of the information pertaining to healthcare is uploaded to the cloud so that it may be analyzed. The last step in the process is training the model using data taken from already-existing medical records. Deep learning strategies are used in order to classify the sound that is produced by the heart. The deep CNN algorithm is used for sound feature extraction and classification. The PASCAL data set is essential to the functioning of the experimental environment. The deep CNN model is performing most accurately.

AB  - Background/Prospective data on the safety and efficacy of the wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) in a real-world setting are lacking. The Prospective Registry of Patients Using the Wearable Defibrillator (WEARIT-II) Registry was designed to provide real-world data on the WCD as a strategy during a period of risk stratification.
   Methods and Results-The WEARIT-II Registry enrolled 2000 patients with ischemic (n=805, 40%), or nonischemic cardiomyopathy (n=927, 46%), or congenital/inherited heart disease (n=268) prescribed WCD between August 2011 and February 2014. Clinical data, arrhythmia events, implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation, and improvement in ejection fraction were captured. The median age was 62 years; the median ejection fraction was 25%. The median WCD wear time was 90 days, with median daily use of 22.5 hours. There was a total of 120 sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 41 patients, of whom 54% received appropriate WCD shock. Only 10 patients (0.5%) received inappropriate WCD therapy. The rate of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias by 3 months was 3% among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and congenital/inherited heart disease, and 1% among nonischemic patients (P=0.02). At the end of WCD use, 840 patients (42%) were implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. The most frequent reason not to implant an implantable cardioverter defibrillator following WCD use was improvement in ejection fraction.
   Conclusions-The WEARIT-II Registry demonstrates a high rate of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias at 3 months in at-risk patients who are not eligible for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, and suggests that the WCD can be safely used to protect patients during this period of risk assessment.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment affect quality of life and stress and are associated with fatigue. Meditation interventions are effective strategies for patients with breast cancer but are often limited by poor access, high cost, substantial time commitment, and poor adherence. In this feasibility study, we investigated the use of a portable, wearable, electroencephalographic device for guided meditation practices by breast cancer patients during the period from breast cancer diagnosis until 3 months after surgical treatment. Methods: We enrolled women (age = 20-75 years) who had received a recent diagnosis of breast cancer and planned to undergo surgical treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to perform guided meditation with the device (intervention group) or receive CD-based stress-reduction education (control group). Surveys were used to measure stress, quality of life, and fatigue at baseline, within 4 days before surgery, up to 14 days after surgery, and at 3 months after surgery. Results: In the intervention group, 15 of 17 participants (88.2%) completed the study; in the control group, 13 of 13 participants completed the study (100%). Participants in both groups had less fatigue and stress and improved quality of life at 2 weeks and 3 months after surgery compared with baseline, but there were no significant intergroup differences at any time point. Conclusion: The use of this wearable electroencephalographic device for meditation is a feasible strategy for patients with breast cancer.

AB  - In recent times, cities are getting smart and can be managed effectively through diverse architectures and services. Smart cities have the ability to support smart medical systems that can infiltrate distinct events (i.e., smart hospitals, smart homes, and community health centres) and scenarios (e.g., rehabilitation, abnormal behavior monitoring, clinical decision-making, disease prevention and diagnosis postmarking surveillance and prescription recommendation). The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with recent technologies, for instance medical screening gadgets, are significant enough to deliver maximum performance and improved management services to handle chronic diseases. With latest developments in digital data collection, AI techniques can be employed for clinical decision making process. On the other hand, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is one of the major illnesses that increase the mortality rate across the globe. Generally, wearables can be employed in healthcare systems that instigate the development of CVD detection and classification. With this motivation, the current study develops an Artificial Intelligence Enabled Decision Support System for CVD Disease Detection and Classification in e-healthcare environment, abbreviated as AIDSS-CDDC technique. The proposed AIDSS-CDDC model enables the Internet of Things (IoT) devices for healthcare data collection. Then, the collected data is saved in cloud server for examination. Followed by, training and testing processes are executed to determine the patient's health condition. To accomplish this, the presented AIDSS-CDDC model employs data pre-processing and Improved Sine Cosine Optimization based Feature Selection (ISCO-FS) technique. In addition, Adam optimizer with Autoencoder Gated RecurrentUnit (AE-GRU) model is employed for detection and classification of CVD. The experimental results highlight that the proposed AIDSS-CDDC model is a promising performer compared to other existing models.

AB  - The accurate electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation is important for several potentially life-threatening cardiac diseases. Recently developed deep learning methods show their ability to distinguish some severe heart diseases. However, since deep neural network requires a high cost on memory consumption and computation, implementation scenarios of these interpretation methods are constrained to nonportable devices. Few commercial portable devices only have heartbeat detection ability, and therefore, only a few simple cardiac diseases can be diagnosed. In this article, to achieve diagnosing a wide range of cardiac diseases and continuous monitoring, a homecare-oriented ECG diagnosis platform is designed based on a large-scale multilabel deep conventional neural network. The accuracy of the proposed neural network model is guaranteed by our constructed large-scale ECG dataset, which is comprised of 206 468 standard 12-lead ECG recordings from 89 488 patients, with respect to 26 types of most common heart rhythms and conduction abnormalities. Meanwhile, targeting lightweight homecare or wearable applications, algorithm-hardware co-optimization is conducted to accelerate the model computation on an embedded platform with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) for continuous monitoring. Channel-level pruning and parameters quantization strategy are employed to optimize the network, and a reconfigurable accelerator hardware architecture is designed to accelerate the convolution computation on FPGA. The final quantified model achieved a promising score of 0.913 & x0025; and 86.7 & x0025; exact match ratio, in which parameters and floating-point operations per second (FLOPs) are significantly penalized compared to the original large-scale model. Real-time analysis is performed. Specifically, the average processing time for each ECG record is 2.895 s, and it can be applied to homecare or portable ECG diagnosis devices for continuous monitoring.

TI  - Atrial fibrillation detection using ambulatory smartwatch photoplethysmography and validation with simultaneous holter recording
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Background Atrial fibrillation (AF)-associated embolic stroke is preventable, and AF detection may help to prevent stroke in subjects with paroxysmal AF. We aimed to evaluate the AF detection performance of smartwatch photoplethysmog-raphy (PPG) and the feasibility of ambulatory monitoring for AF detection in the daily life.
   Design and methods Consecutive subjects who under went ambulator y Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor -ing for AF detection or AF burden evaluation were enrolled. The participants underwent 24 hours of simultaneous Holter ECG monitoring and continuous PPG recording using a Garmin smartwatch. The PPG signals were processed for noise rejection, beat detection, beat labeling, and rhythm labeling for each 5-minute segment. The accuracy of the PPG AF detection was calculated using the corresponding simultaneous Holter ECG as the AF diagnostic standard.
   Results Among the 200 available participants, 112 participants (56%) developed AF (the AF group). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicted value of AF detection in participants were 97.3%, 88.6%, and 91.6%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.90. When the performance was analyzed in these 5-minute segments, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicted values of AF detection were 97.1%, 86.8%, and 89.7%, respectively.
   Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility of ambulatory monitoring for AF detection using a commercial smartwatch in daily life. A smartwatch may be an alternative screening tool to standard ambulatory Holter monitoring.

AB  - Hypertension is a chronic disease causing risk of different types of disorders, such as hypertension attacks, cerebrovascular attacks, kidney failure, and cardiovascular diseases. To prevent such risks, statistics related to hypertension have to be monitored and analyzed in real-time. Internet of Things (IoT)-assisted fog health monitoring system can be used to monitor blood pressure (BP) and to diagnose the stage of hypertension in real-time. In this paper, IoT-fog-based healthcare system is proposed for continuous monitoring and analysis of BP statistics to predict hypertensive users. The proposed system initially identifies the stage of hypertension on the basis of user's health parameters collected using IoT sensors at fog layer. After identifying the hypertensive stage, artificial neural network is used for predicting the risk level of hypertension attack in users at remote sites. The vital point of this paper is to continuously generate emergency alerts of BP fluctuation from fog system to hypertensive users on their mobile phones. Finally, analysis results and compiled medical information of each user are stored on cloud storage for sharing with domain experts, such as clinicians, doctors, and personal caregivers. The temporal information generated from fog layer can be utilized for providing precautionary measures and suggestions well on time for patients' wellness. Experimental results reveal that proposed framework achieves low response time, high accuracy, and bandwidth efficiency.

AB  - Biomedical images are used for capturing the images for diagnosis process and to examine the present condition of organs or tissues. Biomedical image processing concepts are identical to biomedical signal processing, which includes the investigation, improvement, and exhibition of images gathered using x-ray, ultrasound, MRI, etc. At the same time, cervical cancer becomes a major reason for increased women's mortality rate. But cervical cancer is an identified at an earlier stage using regular pap smear images. In this aspect, this paper devises a new biomedical pap smear image classification using cascaded deep forest (BPSIC-CDF) model on Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The BPSIC-CDF technique enables the IoT devices for pap smear image acquisition. In addition, the pre-processing of pap smear images takes place using adaptive weighted mean filtering (AWMF) technique. Moreover, sailfish optimizer with Tsallis entropy (SFO-TE) approach has been implemented for the segmentation of pap smear images. Furthermore, a deep learning based Residual Network (ResNet50) method was executed as a feature extractor and CDF as a classifier to determine the class labels of the input pap smear images. In order to showcase the improved diagnostic outcome of the BPSICCDF technique, a comprehensive set of simulations take place on Herlev database. The experimental results highlighted the betterment of the BPSICCDF technique over the recent state of art techniques interms of different performance measures.

AB  - Continuous ambulatory cardiac monitoring plays a critical role in early detection of abnormality in at-risk patients, thereby increasing the chance of early intervention. In this study, we present an automated ECG classification approach for distinguishing between healthy heartbeats and pathological rhythms. The proposed lightweight solution uses quantized one-dimensional deep convolutional neural networks and is ideal for realtime continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, capable of providing one output prediction per second. Raw ECG data is used as the input to the classifier, eliminating the need for complex data preprocessing on lowpowered wearable devices. In contrast to many compute-intensive approaches, the data analysis can be carried out locally on edge devices, providing privacy and portability. The proposed lightweight solution is accurate (sensitivity of 98.5% and specificity of 99.8%), and implemented on a smartphone, it is energy-efficient and fast, requiring 5.85 mJ and 7.65 ms per prediction, respectively.

AB  - Poor dynamic balance and impaired gait adaptation to different contexts are hallmarks of people with neurological disorders (PwND), leading to difficulties in daily life and increased fall risk. Frequent assessment of dynamic balance and gait adaptability is therefore essential for monitoring the evolution of these impairments and/or the long-term effects of rehabilitation. The modified dynamic gait index (mDGI) is a validated clinical test specifically devoted to evaluating gait facets in clinical settings under a physiotherapist's supervision. The need of a clinical environment, consequently, limits the number of assessments. Wearable sensors are increasingly used to measure balance and locomotion in real-world contexts and may permit an increase in monitoring frequency. This study aims to provide a preliminary test of this opportunity by using nested cross-validated machine learning regressors to predict the mDGI scores of 95 PwND via inertial signals collected from short steady-state walking bouts derived from the 6-minute walk test. Four different models were compared, one for each pathology (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and stroke) and one for the pooled multipathological cohort. Model explanations were computed on the best-performing solution; the model trained on the multipathological cohort yielded a median (interquartile range) absolute test error of 3.58 (5.38) points. In total, 76% of the predictions were within the mDGI's minimal detectable change of 5 points. These results confirm that steady-state walking measurements provide information about dynamic balance and gait adaptability and can help clinicians identify important features to improve upon during rehabilitation. Future developments will include training of the method using short steady-state walking bouts in real-world settings, analysing the feasibility of this solution to intensify performance monitoring, providing prompt detection of worsening/improvements, and complementing clinical assessments.

AB  - As a key service of the future 6G network, healthcare digital twin is the virtual replica of a person, which employs Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and AI-powered models to predict the state of health and provide suggestions to a range of clinical questions. To support healthcare digital twins, the right cyber resilience technologies and policies must be applied and maintained to preserve cyber resilience. Vulnerability detection is a fundamental technology for cyber resilience in healthcare digital twins. Recently, deep learning (DL) has been applied to address the limitations of traditional machine learning in vulnerability detection. However, it is important to consider code context relationships and pay attention on the vulnerability related keywords for searching an IoT vulnerability in healthcare digital twins. Due to massive software and complexity of healthcare digital twin, a full automatic solution is really needed for assisting cyber resilience check in the real-world scenarios. This article presents a novel scheme for recognising potential vulnerable functions to support healthcare digital twins. We develop a new deep neural model to capture bi-directional context relationships among the risky code keywords. A number of well-designed experiments are carried out on a large ground truth, which consists of tens of thousands of vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions from IoT related software. The results show our new scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art DL-based methods for vulnerability detection.

AB  - Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other chronic diseases, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility at great personal and societal cost. Vast amounts of data characterizing human movement are available from research labs, clinics, and millions of smartphones and wearable sensors, but integration and analysis of this large quantity of mobility data are extremely challenging. The authors have established the Mobilize Center ( ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mobilize.stanford.edu">http://mobilize.stanford.edu) to harness these data to improve human mobility and help lay the foundation for using data science methods in biomedicine. The Center is organized around 4 data science research cores: biomechanical modeling, statistical learning, behavioral and social modeling, and integrative modeling.

AB  - Automatic Ingestion Monitor v2 (AIM-2) is an egocentric camera and sensor that aids monitoring of individual diet and eating behavior by capturing still images throughout the day and using sensor data to detect eating. The images may be used to recognize foods being eaten, eating environment, and other behaviors and daily activities. At the same time, captured images may carry privacy concerning content such as (1) people in social eating and/or bystanders (i.e., bystander privacy); (2) sensitive documents that may appear on a computer screen in the view of AIM-2 (i.e., context privacy). In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on automatic, image redaction for privacy protection by selective content removal by semantic segmentation using a deep learning neural network. The proposed method reported a bystander privacy removal with precision of 0.87 and recall of 0.94 and reported context privacy removal by precision and recall of 0.97 and 0.98. The results of the study showed that selective content removal using deep learning neural network is a much more desirable approach to address privacy concerns for an egocentric wearable camera for nutritional studies.

AB  - As many as 40% to 50% of patients do not adhere to long-term medications for managing chronic conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension. Limited opportunity for medication monitoring is a major problem from the perspective of health professionals. The availability of prompt medication error reports can enable health professionals to provide immediate interventions for patients. Furthermore, it can enable clinical researchers to modify experiments easily and predict health levels based on medication compliance. This study proposes a method in which videos of patients taking medications are recorded using a camera image sensor integrated into a wearable device. The collected data are used as a training dataset based on applying the latest convolutional neural network (CNN) technique. As for an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to analyze the medication behavior, we constructed an object detection model (Model 1) using the faster region-based CNN technique and a second model that uses the combined feature values to perform action recognition (Model 2). Moreover, 50,000 image data were collected from 89 participants, and labeling was performed on different data categories to train the algorithm. The experimental combination of the object detection model (Model 1) and action recognition model (Model 2) was newly developed, and the accuracy was 92.7%, which is significantly high for medication behavior recognition. This study is expected to enable rapid intervention for providers seeking to treat patients through rapid reporting of drug errors.

AB  - Objective: This study compared objectively measured and self-reported physical activity (PA) in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) to a healthy reference cohort (RC). Patients and Methods: From May 2017 to August 2020, 211 ACHD (39.9 +/- 9.7 years, 101 female) and 141 healthy adults (35.9 +/- 14.7 years, 76 female) participated in a wearable-based and self-reported PA assessment. Moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and the step count were recorded with the Garmin vivofit((R)) 3 device for 7 consecutive days. Additionally, subjects were asked to report the number of days they are active for >= 30 min throughout the week. Results: Only 33 (17%) ACHD and 36 (26%) healthy controls (p = 0.030) accumulated the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation of 150 min MVPA per week. ACHD were less active per week (ACHD: 40.0 [0.0; 101.0] min. MVPA vs. RC: 75.0 [22.5; 152.5] min. MVPA, p = 0.002) and walked fewer daily steps (ACHD: 8,246 [6,505; 10,434] vs. RC: 9,413 [7,621; 11,654], p = 0.001) than healthy controls. Especially, patients with moderate (p = 0.030), complex (p < 0.001), or surgically corrected (p = 0.008) congenital heart disease accumulated significantly less MVPA than healthy peers throughout the week. A large majority of 72% of ACHD and 58% of the RC overestimated their weekly active days by more than one day. Conclusions: ACHD walked quite a few steps daily but lacked intensity. ACHD was less active than healthy controls and failed to reach international recommendations. They therefore need encouragement toward more intense movement to improve the exercise capacity and lower cardiovascular risk. Self-reported PA showed no agreement to the objectively measured PA.

AB  - BackgroundCommercially available health devices are gaining momentum and represent a great opportunity for monitoring patients for prolonged periods. This study aimed at testing the feasibility of a smart device-based secondary prevention program in a cohort of patients with cryptogenic stroke. MethodsIn this proof-of-principle study, patients with non-disabling ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in the subacute phase were provided with a smartwatch and smart devices to monitor several parameters - i.e., oxygen saturation, blood pressure, steps a day, heart rate and heart rate variability - for a 4-week period (watch group). This group was compared with a standard-of-care group. Our primary endpoint was the compliance with the use of smart devices that was evaluated as the number of measures performed during the observation period. ResultsIn total, 161 patients were recruited, 87 in the WATCH group and 74 in the control group. In the WATCH group, more than 90% of patients recorded the ECG at least once a day. In total, 5,335 ECGs were recorded during the study. The median blood pressure value was 132/78 mmHg and the median oxygen saturation value was 97%. From a clinical standpoint, although not statistically significant, nine atrial fibrillation episodes (10.3%) in the WATCH group vs. 3 (4%) in the control group were detected. ConclusionOur study suggests that prevention programs for cerebrovascular disease may benefit from the implementation of new technologies.

AB  - Aims Dysglycemia, including the three domains hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and increased glycemic variability (GV), is associated with high mortality among critically ill patients. However, this association differs by diabetes status, and reports in this regard are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between the three dysglycemia domains and mortality in critically ill patients by diabetes status and determined the contributing factors for dysglycemia. Methods This retrospective study included 958 critically ill patients (admitted to the ICU) with or without DM. Dysglycemia was defined as abnormality of any of the three dimensions. We evaluated the effects of the three domains of glucose control on mortality using binary logistic regression and then adjusted for confounders. The associations between dysglycemia and other variables were investigated using cumulative logistic regression analysis. Result GV independently and similarly affected mortality in both groups after adjustment for confounders (DM: odds ratio [OR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.08; p <0.001; non-DM: OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.03-1.11; p = 0.002). Hypoglycemia was strongly associated with ICU mortality among patients without DM (3.12; 1.76-5.53; p <0.001) and less so among those with DM (1.18; 0.49-2.83; p = 0.72). Hyperglycemia was non-significantly associated with mortality in both groups. However, the effects of dysglycemia seemed cumulative. The factors contributing to dysglycemia included disease severity, insulin treatment, glucocorticoid use, serum albumin level, total parenteral nutrition, duration of diabetes, elevated procalcitonin level, and need for mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy. Conclusion The association between the three dimensions of dysglycemia and mortality varied by diabetes status. Dysglycemia in critical patients is associated with excess mortality; however, glucose management in patients should be specific to the patient's need considering the diabetes status and broader dimensions. The identified factors for dysglycemia could be used for risk assessment in glucose management requirement in critically ill patients, which may improve clinical outcomes.

AB  - Heart weakness and restricted blood flow into the cavities can cause a range of strokes from mild to severe Heart strokes are primary caused due to the fat deposited on artery walls. The process reduces the intake of blood and internally causes a pseudo vacuum of air bubbles leading to a stroke which can be identified with high-end instrumentations. In this article, a detailed evaluation is processed with a Hybrid Optimization Algorithm (HOA). In the proposed technique, data are preprocessed using a label encoder and the missing values of the dataset are filled. Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Crow Search Algorithm(CSA) extract inter-connected patterns and learning features using a dedicated Deep Neural Networking (DNN) support. The proposed Hybrid Optimization Algorithm extracts features and the resultant values demonstrate a high accuracy range of 97.34%.

AB  - In recent years, many people have been working from home due to the exceptional circumstances concerning the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It has also negatively influenced general health and quality of life. Therefore, physical activity has been gaining much attention in preventing the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. For planning an effective physical activity for different clients, physical activity intensity and load degree needs to be appropriately adjusted depending on the individual's physical/health conditions. Heart rate (HR) is one of the most critical health indicators for monitoring exercise intensity and load degree because it is closely related to the heart rate. Heart rate prediction estimates the heart rate at the next moment based on now and other influencing factors. Therefore, an accurate short-term HR prediction technique can deliver efficient early warning for human health and decrease the happening of harmful events. The work described in this article aims to introduce a novel hybrid approach to model and predict the heart rate dynamics for different exercises. The results indicate that the combination of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) and the Clayton Copula model can accurately predict HR for the short term.

AB  - Question Is population-based atrial fibrillation (AF) screening using wearable devices cost-effective? Findings In this economic evaluation of 30 million simulated individuals with an age, sex, and comorbidity profile matching the US population aged 65 years or older, AF screening using wearable devices was cost-effective, with the overall preferred strategy identified as wearable photoplethysmography, followed conditionally by wearable electrocardiography with patch monitor confirmation (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $57 894 per quality-adjusted life-year). The cost-effectiveness of screening was consistent across multiple scenarios, including strata of sex, screening at earlier ages, and with variation in the association of anticoagulation with risk of stroke associated with screening-detected AF. Meaning This study suggests that contemporary AF screening using wearable devices may be cost-effective.
   Importance Undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important cause of stroke. Screening for AF using wrist-worn wearable devices may prevent strokes, but their cost-effectiveness is unknown. Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of contemporary AF screening strategies, particularly wrist-worn wearable devices. Design, Setting, and Participants This economic evaluation used a microsimulation decision-analytic model and was conducted from September 8, 2020, to May 23, 2022, comprising 30 million simulated individuals with an age, sex, and comorbidity profile matching the US population aged 65 years or older. Interventions Eight AF screening strategies, with 6 using wrist-worn wearable devices (watch or band photoplethysmography, with or without watch or band electrocardiography) and 2 using traditional modalities (ie, pulse palpation and 12-lead electrocardiogram) vs no screening. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Secondary measures included rates of stroke and major bleeding. Results In the base case analysis of this model, the mean (SD) age was 72.5 (7.5) years, and 50% of the individuals were women. All 6 screening strategies using wrist-worn wearable devices were estimated to be more effective than no screening (range of QALYs gained vs no screening, 226-957 per 100 000 individuals) and were associated with greater relative benefit than screening using traditional modalities (range of QALYs gained vs no screening, -116 to 93 per 100 000 individuals). Compared with no screening, screening using wrist-worn wearable devices was associated with a reduction in stroke incidence by 20 to 23 per 100 000 person-years but an increase in major bleeding by 20 to 44 per 100 000 person-years. The overall preferred strategy was wearable photoplethysmography, followed conditionally by wearable electrocardiography with patch monitor confirmation, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $57 894 per QALY, meeting the acceptability threshold of $100 000 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of screening was consistent across multiple scenarios, including strata of sex, screening at earlier ages (eg, >= 50 years), and with variation in the association of anticoagulation with risk of stroke in the setting of screening-detected AF. Conclusions and Relevance This economic evaluation of AF screening using a microsimulation decision-analytic model suggests that screening using wearable devices is cost-effective compared with either no screening or AF screening using traditional methods.
   This economic evaluation uses a microsimulation decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of contemporary atrial fibrillation screening strategies, particularly wrist-worn wearable devices.

AB  - Recently, the need for fast, cost-effective, convenient, and non-invasive cardiovascular analysis techniques has been the primary and most attractive reason to use photoplethysmogram (PPG). Most wearable devices on the market today can collect PPG data and enable the measurement of important features such as heart rate, respiration rate, and blood pressure, in addition to detecting irregular pulses and cardiovascular diseases. One major drawback of PPG data is their high sensitivity to motion, resulting in distorted and meaningless signals. This paper proposes a neural network-based filtering method to remove corrupted windows from the collected PPG data in an unsupervised manner. It also proposes a PPG data summarization and augmentation strategy which optimizes the network performances. Experimental results show that the proposed approach was capable of achieving 90% precision and 95% recall when processing PPG data collected from a Shimmer3 GSR+ sensor.

AB  - Cardiac arrhythmia has been identified as a type of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) that causes approximately 12% of all deaths globally. The development of Internet-of-Things has spawned novel ways for heart monitoring but also presented new challenges for manual arrhythmia detection. An automated method is highly demanded to provide support for physicians. Current attempts for automatic arrhythmia detection can roughly be divided as feature-engineering based and deep-learning based methods. Most of the feature-engineering based methods are suffering from adopting single classifier and use fixed features for classifying all five types of heartbeats. This introduces difficulties in identification of the problematic heartbeats and limits the overall classification performance. The deep-learning based methods are usually not evaluated in a realistic manner and report overoptimistic results which may hide potential limitations of the models. Moreover, the lack of consideration of frequency patterns and the heart rhythms can also limit the model performance. To fill in the gaps, we propose a framework for arrhythmia detection from IoT-based ECGs. The framework consists of two modules: a data cleaning module and a heartbeat classification module. Specifically, we propose two solutions for the heartbeat classification task, namely Dynamic Heartbeat Classification with Adjusted Features (DHCAF) and Multi-channel Heartbeat Convolution Neural Network (MCHCNN). DHCAF is a feature-engineering based approach, in which we introduce dynamic ensemble selection (DES) technique and develop a result regulator to improve classification performance. MCHCNN is deep-learning based solution that performs multi-channel convolutions to capture both temporal and frequency patterns from heartbeat to assist the classification. We evaluate the proposed framework with DHCAF and with MCHCNN on the well-known MIT-BIH-AR database, respectively. The results reported in this paper have proven the effectiveness of our framework.

AB  - Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) imposes much mortality and morbidity worldwide. The use of "deep learning", advancements in genomics, metabolomics, proteomics and devices like wearables have the potential to unearth new insights in the field of cardiology. Currently, in Asia, there are no studies that combine the use of conventional clinical information with these advanced technologies. We aim to harness these new technologies to understand the development of cardiovascular disease in Asia.
   Methods: Singapore is a multi-ethnic country in Asia with well-represented diverse ethnicities including Chinese, Malays and Indians. The SingHEART study is the first technology driven multi-ethnic prospective population-based study of healthy Asians. Healthy male and female subjects aged 21-69 years old without any prior cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus will be recruited from the general population. All subjects are consented to undergo a detailed on-line questionnaire, basic blood investigations, resting and continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring, activity and sleep tracking, calcium score, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, whole genome sequencing and lipidomic analysis. Outcomes studied will include mortality and cause of mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, malignancy, heart failure, and the development of co-morbidities.
   Discussion: An initial target of 2500 patients has been set. From October 2015 to May 2017, an initial 683 subjects have been recruited and have completed the initial work-up the SingHEART project is the first contemporary population-based study in Asia that will include whole genome sequencing and deep phenotyping: including advanced imaging and wearable data, to better understand the development of cardiovascular disease across different ethnic groups in Asia.

AB  - In recent years, researchers designed several artificial intelligence solutions for healthcare applications, which usually evolved into functional solutions for clinical practice. Furthermore, deep learning (DL) methods are well-suited to process the broad amounts of data acquired by wearable devices, smartphones, and other sensors employed in different medical domains. Conceived to serve the role of diagnostic tool and surgical guidance, hyperspectral images emerged as a non-contact, non-ionizing, and label-free technology. However, the lack of large datasets to efficiently train the models limits DL applications in the medical field. Hence, its usage with hyperspectral images is still at an early stage. We propose a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to generate synthetic hyperspectral images of epidermal lesions, targeting skin cancer diagnosis, and overcome small-sized datasets challenges to train DL architectures. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, capable of generating synthetic data to train DL classifiers.

AB  - Background: Measuring mobility in daily life entails dealing with confounding factors arising from multiple sources, including pathological characteristics, patient specific walking strategies, environment/context, and purpose of the task. The primary aim of this study is to propose and validate a protocol for simulating real-world gait accounting for all these factors within a single set of observations, while ensuring minimisation of participant burden and safety. Methods: The protocol included eight motor tasks at varying speed, incline/steps, surface, path shape, cognitive demand, and included postures that may abruptly alter the participants' strategy of walking. It was deployed in a convenience sample of 108 participants recruited from six cohorts that included older healthy adults (HA) and participants with potentially altered mobility due to Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), proximal femoral fracture (PFF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF). A novelty introduced in the protocol was the tiered approach to increase difficulty both within the same task (e.g., by allowing use of aids or armrests) and across tasks. Results: The protocol proved to be safe and feasible (all participants could complete it and no adverse events were recorded) and the addition of the more complex tasks allowed a much greater spread in walking speeds to be achieved compared to standard straight walking trials. Furthermore, it allowed a representation of a variety of daily life relevant mobility aspects and can therefore be used for the validation of monitoring devices used in real life. Conclusions: The protocol allowed for measuring gait in a variety of pathological conditions suggests that it can also be used to detect changes in gait due to, for example, the onset or progression of a disease, or due to therapy.

Design/methodology/approach The prototype can measure blood volumetric change and temperature variation in the forefoot area simultaneously. The waveform extracted using a pulsatile-blood-flow signal was used to assess blood perfusion-related information, and hence, predict ischemic ulcers. The temperature difference between ulcerated and the reference was used to predict neuropathic ulcers. The medical device can be used as a bandage during the application wherein the sensory module is placed inside the hollow pocket of the bandage. A platform was developed through a mobile application where doctors can extract real-time information, and hence, determine the possibility of ulceration. Findings The height of the peaks in the pulsatile-blood-flow signal measured from the subject with foot ischemic ulcers is significantly less than that of the subject without ischemic ulcers. In the presence of ischemic ulcers, the captured waveform flattens. Therefore, the blood perfusion from arteries to the tissue of the forefoot is considerably low for the subject with ischemic ulcers. According to the temperature difference data measured over 25 consecutive days, the temperature difference of the subject with neuropathic ulcers occasionally exceeded the 4 degrees F range but mostly had higher values closer to the 4 degrees F range. However, the temperature difference of the subject who had no complications of neuropathic ulcers did not exceed the 4 degrees F range, and the majority of the measurements occupy a narrow range from -2 degrees F to 2 degrees F. Originality/value The proposed prototype of wearable medical apparatus can monitor both temperature variation and pulsatile-blood-flow signal on the forefoot simultaneously and thereby predict both ischemic and neuropathic diabetes using a single device. Most importantly, the wearable medical device can be used domestically without clinical assistance with a real-time data monitoring platform to predict the possibility of ulceration and the course of action thereof.

AB  - Glucose monitoring is key to the management of diabetes mellitus to maintain optimal glucose control whilst avoiding hypoglycemia. Non-invasive continuous glucose monitoring techniques have evolved considerably to replace finger prick testing, but still require sensor insertion. Physiological variables, such as heart rate and pulse pressure, change with blood glucose, especially during hypoglycemia, and could be used to predict hypoglycemia. To validate this approach, clinical studies that contemporaneously acquire physiological and continuous glucose variables are required. In this work, we provide insights from a clinical study undertaken to study the relationship between physiological variables obtained from a number of wearables and glucose levels. The clinical study included three screening tests to assess neuropathy and acquired data using wearable devices from 60 participants for four days. We highlight the challenges and provide recommendations to mitigate issues that may impact the validity of data capture to enable a valid interpretation of the outcomes.

TI  - 'My watch kept on alarming all night about my heart rate': diagnosis of asymptomatic atrial fibrillation with fast ventricular response in a patient with a recent TIA as the result of a smartwatch alarm
T2  - OXFORD MEDICAL CASE REPORTS

KW  - STROKE
AB  - Atrial fibrillation is a leading cause of stroke and early detection and treatment of the condition are critical. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic and may go undetected and untreated in the routine management of patients with ischaemic strokes or transient ischaemic attacks. Prolonged monitoring does increase the diagnosis rate of atrial fibrillation after an ischaemic cerebrovascular event. Biometric and ECG sensors have been integrated with smartphones, apps and wearable devices which may increase rates of diagnosis of arrhythmias. This case study describes an asymptomatic patient who two months after her initial transient ischaemic attack was alerted by her smartwatch about her nocturnal tachycardia and was subsequently diagnosed with atrial fibrillation ensuring appropriate secondary prophylaxis.

AB  - Global aging population, especially with the global pandemic outbreak of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has endangered human health security. Digital information technology through big data empowerment and intelligent application is widely considered a key element to solve the problems. Stroke is a life-threaten disorder. We studied individual health management and disease risk perception using human health assessment model and make full use of wearable wireless sensor, Internet of Things, big data, and Artificial Intelligence for potential risk monitoring and real-time stroke warning. We proposed an effective method of monitoring, early warning and rescue to improve the stroke treatment. The result shows that the health management empowered by big data can generate new opportunities and ideas to solve early detection and warning of stroke.

AB  - Background: The Apple watch irregular pulse detection algorithm was found to have a positive predictive value of 0.84 for identification of atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to describe the prevalence of arrhythmias other than AF in those with an irregular pulse detected on a smartwatch. Methods: The Apple Heart Study investigated a smartwatch-based irregular pulse notification algorithm to identify AF. For this secondary analysis, we analyzed participants who received an ambulatory ECG patch after index irregular pulse notification. We excluded participants with AF identified on ECG patch and described the prevalence of other arrhythmias on the remaining participant ECG patches. We also reported the proportion of participants self-reporting subsequent AF diagnosis. Results: Among 419 297 participants enrolled in the Apple Heart Study, 450 participant ECG patches were analyzed, with no AF on 297 ECG patches (66%). Non-AF arrhythmias (excluding supraventricular tachycardias <30 beats and pauses <3 seconds) were detected in 119 participants (40.1%) with ECG patches without AF. The most common arrhythmias were frequent PACs (burden >= 1% to <5%, 15.8%; >= 5% to <15%, 8.8%), atrial tachycardia (>= 30 beats, 5.4%), frequent PVCs (burden >= 1% to <5%, 6.1%; >= 5% to <15%, 2.7%), and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (4-7 beats, 6.4%; >= 8 beats, 3.7%). Of 249 participants with no AF detected on ECG patch and patient-reported data available, 76 participants (30.5%) reported subsequent AF diagnosis. Conclusions: In participants with an irregular pulse notification on the Apple Watch and no AF observed on ECG patch, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, mostly PACs and PVCs, were detected in 40% of participants. Defining optimal care for patients with detection of incidental arrhythmias other than AF is important as AF detection is further investigated, implemented, and refined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   Changes in heart rate variability (HRV) occur at the initiation of hypoglycemia due to sympathetic nervous system activity. We investigated the use of HRV detection by a wearable device as an early alert for hypoglycemia.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   This proof-of-principle study included 23 patients with type 1 diabetes (14 women, mean age 42 +/- 11 years). Patients wore a VitalConnect HealthPatch for 5 days. Hypoglycemia was defined as glucose <= 70 mg/dL (<= 3.9 mmol/L) by fingerstick measurement. HRV was analyzed in standardized periods before the hypoglycemic event.
   RESULTS
   Sixty-six hypoglycemic events were recorded. Hypoglycemia caused a typical HRV pattern in 36 (55%) of the hypoglycemic events. Eighteen events (27%) showed an atypical pattern. Ten events were unclassified (15%), and two did not display a change in HRV (3%).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Hypoglycemia causes early changes in HRV that can be detected by a wearable device. Measuring real-time HRV seems promising for early hypoglycemia detection.

AB  - Sun exposure is known to yield beneficial health outcomes, including synthesis of adequate levels of vitamin D and beneficial modulation of blood pressure, and it is a valuable factor in mental health care. However, the increasing incidence of sun/UV exposure-related illness, such as skin cancer, is seriously concerning public health authorities as well as the scientific community. Consequently, moderate sun/UV exposure is strongly recommended. A wearable nanoplasmonic patch whose original color changes upon sun exposure due to its UV-responsive capabilities that are visually detectable has been engineered. The main scaffold of this patch is made of nanopaper, which is a flexible, lightweight, optically transparent and biocompatible Material. Moreover, its UV-responsive agent is based on silver nanoparticles (AgNP), whose nanoplasmonic properties and safe use in bioapplications are widely covered, in the literature. As UV light can modulate the size of AgNP significantly, the nanoplasmonic properties of the AgNP-decorated nanopaper are also modulated leading to a change in color, which is readily observable upon sun exposure. This facilitates that the users can be alerted to moderate sun exposure and may prevent skin damage. Given. the transparent nanoplasmonic nature of the resulting device, after 15 min of artificial sunlight exposure,, the change in color of the patch was proven more observable in skins with the highest and moderate risk of developing skin cancer (skin types I, II, III, and IV) than in skin types V and VI which are reported to tolerate relatively high levels of sun exposure safely. This low-cost wearable device is amenable to facilitating healthcare in low-resource settings using biomaterials and nanoplasmonics.

AB  - Several studies have analyzed heart rate variability (HRV) using nonlinear methods, such as approximate entropy, the largest Lyapunov exponent, and correlation dimension in patients with cardiovascular disorders. However, few studies have used nonlinear methods to analyze HRV in order to determine the level of physical fatigue experienced by construction workers. As a result, to identify and categorize physical fatigue in construction workers, the current study examined the linear and nonlinear approaches of HRV analysis. Fifteen healthy construction workers (mean age, 33.2 +/- 6.9 years) were selected for this study. A textile-based wearable sensor monitored each participant's HRV after they completed 60 min of bar bending and fixing tasks. At baseline, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min into the task, participants were given the Borg-20 to measure their subjective levels of physical fatigue. Nonlinear [e.g., R-R interval (RRI) variability, entropy, detrended fluctuation analysis] and linear (e.g., time- and frequency-domain) HRV parameters were extracted. Five machine learning classifiers were used to identify and discern different physical fatigue levels. The accuracy and validity of the classifier models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. The classification models were developed by either combining or individualized HRV features derived from linear and nonlinear HRV analyses. In the individualized feature sets, time-domain features had the highest classification accuracy (92%) based on the random forest (RF) classifier. The combined feature (i.e., the time-domain and nonlinear features) sets showed the highest classification accuracy (93.5%) using the RF classifier. In conclusion, this study showed that both linear and nonlinear HRV analyses can be used to detect and classify physical fatigue in construction workers. This research offers important contributions to the industry by analyzing the variations in linear and nonlinear HRV parameters in response to construction tasks. This study demonstrates that HRV values changed significantly in response to physical work, indicating a change in the relative activity of cardiac autonomic functions as a result of fatigue. Using the ways in which HRV parameters vary in response to increased workloads provides a sensitive marker for contrasting construction workers with and without cardiovascular disease. It also allows the site manager to track how quickly workers fatigue, so that they can switch up their workload to reduce the likelihood that any one worker would get severely exhausted, or to suggest that workers who are already severely fatigued take a break to prevent further injury.

AB  - The human gait can be described as the synergistic activity of all individual components of the sensory-motor system. The central nervous system (CNS) develops synergies to execute endpoint motion by coordinating muscle activity to reflect the global goals of the endpoint trajectory. This paper proposes a new method for assessing temporal dynamic synergies. Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on the signals acquired by wearable sensors (inertial measurement units, IMU and ground reaction force sensors, GRF mounted on feet) to detect temporal synergies in the space of two-dimensional PCA cyclograms. The temporal synergy results for different gait speeds in healthy subjects and stroke patients before and after the therapy were compared. The hypothesis of invariant temporal synergies at different gait velocities was statistically confirmed, without the need to record and analyze muscle activity. A significant difference in temporal synergies was noticed in hemiplegic gait compared to healthy gait. Finally, the proposed PCA-based cyclogram method provided the therapy follow-up information about paretic leg gait in stroke patients that was not available by observing conventional parameters, such as temporal and symmetry gait measures.

AB  - Lung sounds acquired by stethoscopes are extensively used in diagnosing and differentiating respiratory diseases. Although an extensive know-how has been built to interpret these sounds and identify diseases associated with certain patterns, its effective use is limited to individual experience of practitioners. This user-dependency manifests itself as a factor impeding the digital transformation of this valuable diagnostic tool, which can improve patient outcomes by continuous long-term respiratory monitoring under real-life conditions. Particularly patients suffering from respiratory diseases with progressive nature, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, are expected to benefit from long-term monitoring. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has also shown the lack of respiratory monitoring systems which are ready to deploy in operational conditions while requiring minimal patient education. To address particularly the latter subject, in this article, we present a sound acquisition module which can be integrated into a dedicated garment; thus, minimizing the role of the patient for positioning the stethoscope and applying the appropriate pressure. We have implemented a diaphragm-less acousto-electric transducer by stacking a silicone rubber and a piezoelectric film to capture thoracic sounds with minimum attenuation. Furthermore, we benchmarked our device with an electronic stethoscope widely used in clinical practice to quantify its performance.

AB  - Diabetes, in all of its types, costs countries of all income levels unacceptably enormous personal, societal, and economic expenses. To predict type-2 diabetes, this work aimed to develop an analytical predictive model based on machine learning techniques and a web-based personalized diabetes monitoring system. The history of a patient will be collected and ready for analysis purposes based on machine learning techniques by continuously monitoring the patient's vital data. A diabetes monitoring system is proposed by utilizing the patient's QR card that allows the patients and doctors to be connected to the Internet of Things. So, they can deliver real-time information (such as insulin records) about their health status and can visit different healthcare institutions. The proposed system can help doctors to make data-driven decisions and enhance patients' treatment. Several machine learning algorithms that are Decision Tree, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Multi-layer Perceptron's, Artificial Neural Network, k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes are used. The proposed analytical model is evaluated based on two different datasets a synthetic dataset and PIMA Diabetes Dataset. The performance of the classification models was analyzed in terms of accuracy, recall, and precision based on the cross-validation strategy. The findings show that the ANN model has better prediction accuracy than other models. The evaluation findings are analyzed and compared with other existing models. The system has dashboard graphs displaying the number of patients in Saudi Arabia cities. It also contains visualized graphs that include more detailed classifications for patients' states (Normal, Pre-Diabetes, and Diabetes).

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), it becomes convenient to use mobile devices to remotely monitor the physiological signals (e.g., Arrhythmia diseases) of patients with chronic diseases [e.g., cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)]. High classification accuracy of interpatient electrocardiograms is extremely important for diagnosing Arrhythmia. The Supraventricular ectopic beat (S) is especially difficult to be classified. It is often misclassified as Normal (N) or Ventricular ectopic beat (V). Class imbalance is another common and important problem in electronic health (eHealth), as abnormal samples (i.e., samples of specific diseases) are usually far less than normal samples. To solve these problems, we propose a sustainable deep learning-based heart beat classification system, called BeatClass. It contains three main components: two stacked bidirectional long short-term memory networks (Bi-LSTMs), called Rist and Morst, and a generative adversarial network (GAN), called MorphGAN. Rist first classifies the heartbeats into five common Arrhythmia classes. The heartbeats classified as S and V by Rist are further classified by Morst to improve the classification accuracy. MorphGAN is used to augment the morphological and contextual knowledge of heartbeats in infrequent classes. In the experiment, BeatClass is compared with several state-of-the-art works for interpatient arrhythmia classification. The Fl-scores of classifying N, S, and V heartbeats are 0.6%, 16.0%, and 1.8% higher than the best baseline method. The experimental result demonstrates that taking multiple classification models to improve classification results step-by-step may significantly improve the classification performance. We also evaluate the classification sustainability of BeatClass. Based on different physical signal data sets, a trained BeatClass can be updated to classify heartbeats with different sampling rates. Finally, an engineering application indicates that BeatClass can promote the sustainable development of IoT-based eHealth.

AB  - Continuous imaging of cardiac functions is highly desirable for the assessment of long-term cardiovascular health, detection of acute cardiac dysfunction and clinical management of critically ill or surgical patients(1-4). However, conventional non-invasive approaches to image the cardiac function cannot provide continuous measurements owing to device bulkiness(5-11), and existing wearable cardiac devices can only capture signals on the skin(12-16). Here we report a wearable ultrasonic device for continuous, real-time and direct cardiac function assessment. We introduce innovations in device design and material fabrication that improve the mechanical coupling between the device and human skin, allowing the left ventricle to be examined from different views during motion. We also develop a deep learning model that automatically extracts the left ventricular volume from the continuous image recording, yielding waveforms of key cardiac performance indices such as stroke volume, cardiac output and ejection fraction. This technology enables dynamic wearable monitoring of cardiac performance with substantially improved accuracy in various environments.

AB  - The growing prevalence and high mortality rate due to valvular heart diseases (VHD) are concerned. Therefore, its accurate, rapid, and early diagnosis is important. This study processes the phonocardiogram (PCG) signals for automatic detection of VHD associated with aortic stenosis (AS), mitral stenosis (MS), mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and mitral regurgitation (MR) which is originated by the MVP. In the proposed approach, we have used Fourier-Bessel series expansion-based empirical wavelet transform (FBSE-EWT) for capturing the non-stationary nature of PCG signals. It follows by selecting significant Fourier-Bessel intrinsic mode functions (FBIMFs) and extraction of geometrical features from two-dimensional phase space reconstruction (2D-PSRs) of the FBIMFs. To reduce the real-time processing load, the feature set dimension is reduced by using metaheuristics optimization based features selection (FS) algorithms, namely, the salp swarm optimization algorithm (SSOA), emperor penguin optimization algorithm (EPOA), and tree growth optimization algorithm (TGOA). These FS methods have been tested and compared with machine learning classifiers. The result indicates the effectivity of FBSEEWT based features extraction and used FS methods in classifying the intended categories of PCG signals. With the reduced features set, obtained with SSOA, the proposed approach has resulted in the highest classification accuracies of 98.53 %, 98.84 %, 99.07 % and 99.70 % respectively for the five classes, four classes, three classes, and two classes problems. Thus, besides aiding the cardiologists, this approach is also useful for developing wearable cardiac devices (as it uses a reduced feature set) for heart health monitoring and diagnosis purposes.

AB  - Wireless localization systems have significant impact in the field of human-driven edge computing (HEC). It became very attractive among the researchers and used in applications of numerous areas such as medical, industrial, public safety, logistics, and so on. Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology used in localization systems owing to achieving high accuracy in real-time. In this paper, we exhibit a UWB based localization system based on the edge computing (EC) paradigm to analyze the wandering behavior of the patients who are suffering from dementia disease in the large-scale form. Physical changes in the brain are responsible for dementia disease. The appearance of wandering behavior is a common manner of the patients, which also a threat and interference for caregivers. We used the UWB standard appliance to symbolize various sorts of wandering patterns, including pacing, lapping, and two random movements in the large 2D map. The flow of all the movements illustrated in the X and Y-axis. Support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithms used to classify all the patterns and accuracy result is above 99 & x0025;. The result shows that the proposed system can achieve high accuracy in classification and satisfactory for applications in the medical area.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has recently experienced popularity and growth in every facet of life, and it has been applied to every industry in recent years. The healthcare system has not been left out of the equation, where various services are considered toward improved healthcare and patient delivery. It is important to emphasize that related literature on the applications of IoT in healthcare explored various services on an individual basis without considering the consolidated services as we have introduced. Here, the consolidation of those services proffers improved healthcare delivery, which impacts and collaborates in an IoT-based healthcare environment. In this paper, we have utilized the newly formed Saskatchewan Health Authority comprising of various healthcare regions as our case study. In essence, we have proposed a Smart Saskatchewan Healthcare System based on IoT technology in the context of four services, namely: business analytics and cloud services, cancer care services, emergency services, and operational services. Further, the paper highlights the design implementation of a smart healthcare system for the province of Saskatchewan for enhanced electronic medical record initiative and also to augment and support the existing healthcare delivery options to ensure the quality of life of patients by integrating IoT technology and other pertinent technologies in the contexts of those services. It also features IoT-based network mapping, designs, methodologies, frameworks, architectures, platforms, and applications for the IoT based solution for all connected things (network resources and sites) towards efficient healthcare delivery. We have combined all these services to foster faster and more efficient healthcare delivery. We have also alluded that the stream of patient health data generated by the IoT smart/connected devices will be helpful in decision making and gaining insights. The operational challenges and security concerns pertinent to the design of the smart healthcare system are discussed. Lastly, from the design network solutions, it is evident to admit that the solution arguments and delivers improved healthcare delivery using IoT/WSN technologies.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in India and globally are the major cause of mortality, as revealed by the World Health Organization (WHO). The irregularities in the pace of heartbeats, called cardiac arrhythmias or heart arrhythmias, are one of the commonly diagnosed CVDs caused by ischemic heart disease, hypertension, alcohol intake, and stressful lifestyle. Other than the listed CVDs, the abnormality in the cardiac rhythm caused by the long term mental stress (stimulated by Autonomic Nervous System (ANS)) is a challenging issue for researchers. Early detection of cardiac arrhythmias through automatic electronic techniques is an important research field since the invention of electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) and advanced machine learning algorithms. ECG (EKG) provides the record of variations in electrical activity associated with the cardiac cycle, used by cardiologists and researchers as a gold standard to study the heart function. The present work is aimed to provide an extensive survey of work done by researchers in the area of automated ECG analysis and classification of regular & irregular classes of heartbeats by conventional and modern artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The artificial intelligence (AI) based methods have emerged popularly during the last decade for the automatic and early diagnosis of clinical symptoms of arrhythmias. In this work, the literature is explored for the last two decades to review the performance of AI and other computer-based techniques to analyze the ECG signals for the prediction of cardiac (heart rhythm) disorders. The existing ECG feature extraction techniques and machine learning (ML) methods used for ECG signal analysis and classification are compared using the performance metrics like specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, positive predictivity value, etc. Some popular AI methods, which include, artificial neural networks (ANN), Fuzzy logic systems, and other machine learning algorithms (support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), etc.) are considered in this review work for the applications of cardiac arrhythmia classification. The popular ECG databases available publicly to evaluate the classification accuracy of the classifier are also mentioned. The aim is to provide the reader, the prerequisites, the methods used in the last two decades, and the systematic approach, all at one place to further purse a research work in the area of cardiovascular abnormalities detection using the ECG signal. As a contribution to the current work, future challenges for real-time remote ECG acquisition and analysis using the emerging technologies like wireless body sensor network (WBSN) and the internet of things (IoT) are identified.

AB  - Computational intelligence (CI) and artificial intelligence (AI) have incredible roles to play in the development of smart and sustainable healthcare systems by facilitating the integration of smart technologies with conventional medical procedures. The Internet of Things (IoT) and CI healthcare systems rely heavily on data collection and machine learning since miniature devices represent the foundation and paradigm shift to sustainable healthcare. With these advancements in AI techniques, we can reduce our environmental impact, while simultaneously enhancing the quality of our services. Widespread use of these devices for innovative IoT applications, however, generates massive amounts of data, which can significantly strain processing power. There is still a need for an efficient and sustainable model in the area of disease predictions, such as lung cancer, blood cancer, and breast cancer. The fundamental purpose of this research is to prove the efficacy of a secure Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in the detection and management of breast cancer via the use of gated recurrent units (GRUs), which are a more recent version of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The blockchain has been employed to achieve the secure IoMT. Unlike long short-term memory units, they do not have a cell state of their own. Therefore, we have combined GRU with RNN to achieve the best results. When training a GRU-RNN classifier, it is typically necessary to collect tagged IoT data from many sources, which raises significant concerns about the confidentiality of the data. To verify the model, the experiment is performed on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC). The experimental result shows that the GRU-RNN has been archived 95% in terms of the accuracy metric, and the efficacy of the proposed IoMT model is superior to the existing approach in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.

AB  - Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) could have independent and critical prognostic values in patients admitted for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). There are limited data in the literature regarding HRV assessment in STEMI setting. Thus, we aim to investigate the potential correlations between HRV and adverse outcomes in a contemporary cohort of patients presenting with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods: We will perform a prospective, observational cohort study in a single healthcare center. Adult patients aged >= 18 years presenting with STEMI in sinus rhythm will be enrolled for primary PCI within 12 h from symptoms onset. Time domain, frequency domain, and nonlinear HRV parameters will be measured using a medically approved wrist-wearable device for 5 min segments during myocardial revascularization by primary PCI. Additional HRV measurements will be performed one and six months from the index event. The primary composite outcome will include all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (during the hospital stay, one month, and one year following admission). Several secondary outcomes will be analyzed: individual components of the primary composite outcome, target lesion revascularization, hospitalizations for heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular diastolic function. Conclusions: Our study will enlighten the reliability and usefulness of HRV evaluation as a prognostic marker in contemporary patients with STEMI. The potential validation of HRV as a risk marker for adverse outcomes following STEMI will ensure a background for including HRV parameters in future risk scores and guidelines.

AB  - In recent years, neurological diseases have become a standout amongst all the other diseases and are the most important reasons for mortality and morbidity all over the world. The current study's aim is to conduct a pilot study for testing the prototype of the designed glove-wearable technology that could detect and analyze the heart rate and EEG for better management and avoiding stroke consequences. The qualitative, clinical experimental method of assessment was explored by incorporating use of an IoT-based real-time assessing medical glove that was designed using heart rate-based and EEG-based sensors. We conducted structured interviews with 90 patients, and the results of the interviews were analyzed by using the Barthel index and were grouped accordingly. Overall, the proportion of patients who followed proper daily heart rate recording behavior went from 46.9% in the first month of the trial to 78.2% after 3-10 months of the interventions. Meanwhile, the percentage of individuals having an irregular heart rate fell from 19.5% in the first month of the trial to 9.1% after 3-10 months of intervention research. In T5, we found that delta relative power decreased by 12.1% and 5.8% compared with baseline at 3 and at 6months and an average increase was 24.3 +/- 0.08. Beta-1 remained relatively steady, while theta relative power grew by 7% and alpha relative power increased by 31%. The T1 hemisphere had greater mean values of delta and theta relative power than the T5 hemisphere. For alpha (p<0.05) and beta relative power, the opposite pattern was seen. The distinction was statistically significant for delta (p<0.001), alpha (p<0.01), and beta-1 (p<0.05) among T1 and T5 patient groups. In conclusion, our single center-based study found that such IoT-based real-time medical monitoring devices significantly reduce the complexity of real-time monitoring and data acquisition processes for a healthcare provider and thus provide better healthcare management. The emergence of significant risks and controlling mechanisms can be improved by boosting the awareness. Furthermore, it identifies the high-risk factors besides facilitating the prevention of strokes. The EEG-based brain-computer interface has a promising future in upcoming years to avert DALY.

AB  - Within the field of robotics and autonomous systems where there is a human in the loop, intent recognition plays an important role. This is especially true for wearable assistive devices used for rehabilitation, particularly post-stroke recovery. This paper reports results on the use of tactile patterns to detect weak muscle contractions in the forearm while at the same time associating these patterns with the muscle synergies during different grips. To investigate this concept, a series of experiments with healthy participants were carried out using a tactile arm brace (TAB) on the forearm while performing four different types of grip. The expected force patterns were established by analysing the muscle synergies of the four grip types and the forearm physiology. The results showed that the tactile signatures of the forearm recorded on the TAB align with the anticipated force patterns. Furthermore, a linear separability of the data across all four grip types was identified. Using the TAB data, machine learning algorithms achieved a 99% classification accuracy. The TAB results were highly comparable to a similar commercial intent recognition system based on a surface electromyography (sEMG) sensing.

AB  - Exhaled breath contains a large amount of biochemical and physiological information concerning one's health and provides an alternative route to noninvasive medical diagnosis of diseases. In the case of lung diseases, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important biomarker associated with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer and can be detected in exhaled breath. The current method of breath analysis involves condensation of exhaled breath, is not continuous or real time, and requires two separate and bulky devices, complicating the periodic or long-term monitoring of a patient. We report the first disposable paper-based electrochemical wearable sensor that can monitor exhaled H2O2 in artificial breath calibration-free and continuously, in real time, and can be integrated into a commercial respiratory mask for on-site testing of exhaled breath. To improve precision for sensing H2O2, we perform differential electrochemical measurement by amperometry in which screen-printed Prussian Blue-mediated and nonmediated carbon electrodes are used for differential analysis. We were able to measure H(2)O(2 )in simulated breath in a concentration-dependent manner in real time, confirming its functionality. This proposed system is versatile, and by modifying the chemistry of the sensing electrodes, our method of differential sensing can be extended to continuous monitoring of other analytes in exhaled breath.

AB  - Introduction: The shift toward remote patient monitoring methods to detect clinical deterioration re-quires testing of wearable devices in real-life clinical settings. This study aimed to develop a remote early warning scoring (REWS) system based on continuous measurements using a wearable device, and compare its diagnostic performance for the detection of deterioration to the diagnostic performance of the conventional modified early warning score (MEWS).Materials and methods: The study population of this prospective, single center trial consisted of patients who underwent major abdominal cancer surgery and were monitored using routine in-hospital spotcheck measurements of the vital parameters. Heart and respiratory rates were measured continu-ously using a wireless accelerometer patch (HealthDot). The prediction by MEWS of deterioration toward a complication graded Clavien-Dindo of 2 or higher was compared to the REWS derived from continuous measurements by the wearable patch.Main results: A total of 103 patients and 1909 spot-check measurements were included in the analysis. Postoperative deterioration was observed in 29 patients. For both EWS systems, the sensitivity (MEWS: 0.20 95% CI: [0.13-0.29], REWS: 0.20 95% CI: [0.13-0.29]) and specificity (MEWS: 0.96 95% CI: [0.95-0.97], REWS: 0.96 95% CI: [0.95-0.97]) were assessed.Conclusions: The diagnostic value of the REWS method, based on continuous measurements of the heart and respiratory rates, is comparable to that of the MEWS in patients following major abdominal cancer surgery. The wearable patch could detect the same amount of deteriorations, without requiring manual spot check measurements.(c) 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart rate monitoring is useful to detect many cardiovascular diseases. It can be implemented in a small device with low power consumption, and it can exploit low-cost piezoelectric pressure sensors to measure heart rate. However, it is also desirable to transmit heartbeat waveform for emergency treatment, which significantly increases transmission power.
   OBJECTIVE: In this paper, a low-cost wireless heart condition monitoring SoC is proposed. It can monitor and transmit both heart rate and heartbeat waveform, but the hardware is extremely simplified to achieve in a small package.
   METHODS: By slight modification of successive-approximation analog-digital converter, it can count heart rate and read out heartbeat waveform with the same hardware. In the normal mode, only an 8-bit heart rate is transmitted for power reduction. If the heart rate is out of a given range, it goes to the emergency mode and a 10-bit heartbeat waveform is transmitted for fast treatment.
   RESULTS: The fabricated chip size is 1.1 mm(2) in 0.11 mu m CMOS technology, including the radio-frequency transmitter. The measured power consumption is 161.8 mu W in normal mode and 507.3 mu W in emergency mode, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: The proposed SoC achieves low-cost, small area, and low-power. It is useful as part of a disposable healthcare system.

AB  - Muscle strength is mostly measured by wearable devices. However, wearing such devices is a tedious, unpleasant, and sometimes impossible task for stroke patients. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed to estimate the strength of the upper limb muscles of a stroke patient by using Microsoft Kinect sensor. A prototype exergame is designed and developed to mimic real post-stroke rehabilitation exercises. Least-square regression matrix is used to find the relation between the kinematics of the upper limb and the strength of the corresponding muscles. Kinect sensor is used along with a force sensing resistors (FSR) glove and two straps to collect both, real-time upper limb joints data and the strength of muscles of the subjects while they are performing the exercises. The prototype of this system is tested on five stroke patients and eight healthy subjects. Results show that there is no statistically significant difference between the measured and the estimated values of the upper-limb muscles of the stroke patients. Thus, the proposed method is useful in estimating the strength of the muscles of stroke patient without the need to wear any devices.

AB  - Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive impairment are age-related disorders. Nonetheless, it is possible to maintain Alzheimer's patients' quality of life by meeting their needs and reducing the unfavorable consequences. This study introduces an Alzheimer's Intelligence Care System (AICS), which can meet various needs of such patients while adapting itself to the disease progression.
   Material and Methods: Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) was administered to measure the patients' cognitive abilities. The system, then, assigned the patients to level one or two, depending on the severity of their conditions. Afterwards, medicinal, nutritional and athletic schedules as well as a daily routine schedule were given to the patients to follow on three domains as follows: (a) improving the patients' memory through such activities as mental massage and play therapy, which all aim at boosting cognitive abilities, (b) reminding the patients to do their necessary daily jobs, and (c) tracking the patients' daily activities in order to protect them from probable hazards.
   Results: It was predicted that constantly following a rigorous schedule helps to control the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to a large extent, thereby slowing or stopping further decline of cognitive ability. Nonetheless, due to various factors contributing to the disease in the elderly, the effectiveness of the method is contingent upon many external factors.
   Conclusion: The proposed system in this article intended to meet the patients' needs in improving their memory (massage therapy, play therapy), reminding them to do their necessary daily jobs, and tracking their daily activities in order to protect them from probable hazards through different stages of the disease with capability of adjusting itself to new needs as they emerge, thereby slowing or stopping further decline of the cognitive ability. Further Research on this subject is recommended.

AB  - Interpersonal physiological synchrony has been successfully used to characterize social interactions and social processes during a variety of interpersonal interactions. There are a handful of measures of interpersonal physiological synchrony, but those that exist have only been validated on able-bodied adults. Here, we present a novel information-theory based measure of interpersonal physiological synchrony-normalized Symbolic Transfer Entropy (NSTE)-and compare its performance with a popular physiological synchrony measure-physiological concordance and single session index (SSI). Using wearable sensors, we measured the electrodermal activity (EDA) of five individuals with dementia and six able-bodied individuals as they participated in a movement activity that aimed to foster connection in persons with dementia. We calculated time-resolved NSTE and SSI measures for case studies of three dyads and compared them against moments of observed interpersonal connection in video recordings of the activity. Our findings suggest that NSTE-based measures of interpersonal physiological synchrony may provide additional advantages over SSI, including resolving moments of ambiguous SSI and providing information about the direction of information flow between participants. This study also investigated the feasibility of using interpersonal synchrony to gain insight into moments of connection experienced by individuals with dementia and further encourages exploration of these measures in other populations with reduced communicative abilities.

AB  - BackgroundPresenting symptoms of COVID-19 patients are unusual compared with many other illnesses. Blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate may stay within acceptable ranges as the disease progresses. Consequently, intermittent monitoring does not detect deterioration as it is happening. We investigated whether continuously monitoring heart rate and respiratory rate enables earlier detection of deterioration compared with intermittent monitoring, or introduces any risks.MethodsWhen available, patients admitted to a COVID-19 ward received a wireless wearable sensor which continuously measured heart rate and respiratory rate. Two intensive care unit (ICU) physicians independently assessed sensor data, indicating when an intervention might be necessary (alarms). A third ICU physician independently extracted clinical events from the electronic medical record (EMR events). The primary outcome was the number of true alarms. Secondary outcomes included the time difference between true alarms and EMR events, interrater agreement for the alarms, and severity of EMR events that were not detected.ResultsIn clinical practice, 48 (EMR) events occurred. None of the 4 ICU admissions were detected with the sensor. Of the 62 sensor events, 13 were true alarms (also EMR events). Of these, two were related to rapid response team calls. The true alarms were detected 39 min (SD = 113) before EMR events, on average. Interrater agreement was 10%. Severity of the 38 non-detected events was similar to the severity of 10 detected events.ConclusionContinuously monitoring heart rate and respiratory rate does not reliably detect deterioration in COVID-19 patients when assessed by ICU physicians.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) is an important physiological parameter to assess the status of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and diagnose cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). HRV is generally extracted from the cardiac activity monitored at the chest using electrocardiography (ECG). This article presents a novel algorithm to accurately extract HRV, from signals obtained using an innovative wearable approach based on acoustic sensing of cardiac activity at the wrist. The proposed methodology is based on the relative energy method, which utilizes the relative information between short and long-term energies of the acoustic signal to enhance the Sl's characteristics in comparison to other signal transitions. The algorithm was tested on a dataset consisting of acoustic recordings of 5-min duration obtained from 12 subjects. For the instantaneous heart rate (IHR) determination, 98.50% and 98.96% of the total samples achieved a relative error of less than +/- 5% when compared to ECG and photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, respectively. The comparison of the HRV parameters in the time-domain and the frequency-domain, with the reference signals, also demonstrated a strong statistical agreement and correlation of close to one, hence proving the feasibility of extracting the HRV from acoustic signals recorded at the wrist.

AB  - The assessment of spasticity under voluntary movement is helpful for the therapist to comprehensively assess the patient's dyskinesia. However, current researches focus on spasticity evaluation based on passive motion. We propose a new method for evaluating spasticity under active motion. Our method is based on the following three steps: (i) Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is used to reduce involuntary movement noise in patients' active movement; (ii) Extract voluntary movement segments of each muscle for feature extract and fusion; (iii) Use machine learning methods to evaluate the degree of spasm in patients. To investigates the feasibility of the method proposed in this paper, An experiment of elbow flexion and extension against gravity is designed, and the electromyographic signal of brachioradialis (BR), biceps brachialis (BB), triceps brachialis (TB) and elbow motion data of 13 subjects were collected. We compared the classification effect of filter method, window length and classifier type. Moreover, we analyze the improvement of classification effect by data fusion. The results showed that the random forest with a window length of 256 ms had the best effect (F1-score = 0.952). Compared with the electromyographic signal (F1-score = 0.756) or motion signal only (F1-score = 0.7053), the method presented in this paper had better classification accuracy. Result demonstrated the feasibility of our method. This study can assist doctors to evaluate patients' spasmodic state under active movement, and has the application potential of wearable devices.

AB  - BackgroundGait is usually assessed by clinical tests, which may have poor accuracy and be biased, or instrumented systems, which potentially solve these limitations at the cost of being time-consuming and expensive. The different versions of the Microsoft Kinect have enabled human motion tracking without using wearable sensors at a low-cost and with acceptable reliability. This study aims: First, to determine the sensitivity of an open-access Kinect v2-based gait analysis system to motor disability and aging; Second, to determine its concurrent validity with standardized clinical tests in individuals with stroke; Third, to quantify its inter and intra-rater reliability, standard error of measurement, minimal detectable change; And, finally, to investigate its ability to identify fall risk after stroke.MethodsThe most widely used spatiotemporal and kinematic gait parameters of 82 individuals post-stroke and 355 healthy subjects were estimated with the Kinect v2-based system. In addition, participants with stroke were assessed with the Dynamic Gait Index, the 1-min Walking Test, and the 10-m Walking Test.ResultsThe system successfully characterized the performance of both groups. Significant concurrent validity with correlations of variable strength was detected between all clinical tests and gait measures. Excellent inter and intra-rater reliability was evidenced for almost all measures. Minimal detectable change was variable, with poorer results for kinematic parameters. Almost all gait parameters proved to identify fall risk.ConclusionsResults suggest that although its limited sensitivity to kinematic parameters, the Kinect v2-based gait analysis could be used as a low-cost alternative to laboratory-grade systems to complement gait assessment in clinical settings.

AB  - As the risk of diseases diabetes and hypertension increases, machine learning algorithms are being utilized to improve early stage diagnosis. This study proposes a Hybrid Prediction Model (HPM), which can provide early prediction of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and hypertension based on input risk-factors from individuals. The proposed HPM consists of Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN)-based outlier detection to remove the outlier data, Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the distribution of class, and Random Forest (RF) to classify the diseases. Three benchmark datasets were utilized to predict the risk of diabetes and hypertension at the initial stage. The result showed that by integrating DBSCAN-based outlier detection, SMOTE, and RF, diabetes and hypertension could be successfully predicted. The proposed HPM provided the best performance result as compared to other models for predicting diabetes as well as hypertension. Furthermore, our study has demonstrated that the proposed HPM can be applied in real cases in the IoT-based Health-care Monitoring System, so that the input risk-factors from end-user android application can be stored and analyzed in a secure remote server. The prediction result from the proposed HPM can be accessed by users through an Android application; thus, it is expected to provide an effective way to find the risk of diabetes and hypertension at the initial stage.

AB  - It is essential to change health services from a hospital to a patient-centric platform since medical costs are steadily growing and new illnesses are emerging on a worldwide scale. This study provides an optimal decision support system based on the cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) for identifying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) to provide patients with efficient remote healthcare services. To identify the presence of medical data for CKD, the proposed technique uses an algorithm named Improved Simulated Annealing-Root Mean Square -Logistic Regression (ISA-RMS-LR). The four subprocesses that make up the proposed model are a collection of data, preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The incorporation of Simulated Annealing (SA) during Feature Selection (FS) enhances the ISA-RMS-LR model's classifier outputs. Using the CKD benchmark dataset, the ISA-RMS-LR model's efficacy has been verified. According to the experimental findings, the proposed ISA-RMS-LR model effectively classifies patients with CKD, with high sensitivity at 99.46%, accuracy at 99.26%, Specificity at 98%, F-score at 99.63%, and kappa value at 98.29%. The proposed system has many benefits including the fast transmission of medical data to the medical personnel, real-time tracking, and registration condition of the patient through a medical record. Potential enhancement of the performance measures the provider system's hospital capacity and monitoring of a significant number of patients with a concentrated average delay.

AB  - Stroke is one of the fatal diseases that affect the brain and causes death within 3 to 10 h. However, most of the deaths caused by a stroke can be avoided with the identification of the nature of stroke and react to it in a timely manner by intelligent health systems. The state-of-the-art cyber-physical systems (CPS) enable interaction between physical and computational world to identify any anomaly in the physical world and respond to it. The response of CPS may vary depending upon the context of the physical world. Extensive research has been done in this area from the perspective of wireless sensor networks, body area networks, and wearable smart devices. This paper proposes a CPS for detecting the occurrence of stroke in patients, who have a high risk of stroke or have survived a stroke before. The developed CPS sends recorded data to the doctor and alerts him when the stroke occurs. The proposed system is operating on data acquired from electroencephalography sensors from patients' brain. This article aimed at decreasing human mortality rate due to stroke and will bridge the gaps in CPS due to interdisciplinary isolation. The disciplines involved in the development of a CPS include communication networks, pattern recognition, software engineering, mathematics, and biomedical.

AB  - Air pollution is one of the most concerning and alarming problems in the modern world, and it is increasing day by day due to a large number of industries and urbanization. When pollutants are released into the air from several sources, such as the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial emissions, agricultural sources, and so on, it is referred to as air pollution. It is acknowledged as a significant risk factor for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) that include lung cancer, stroke, heart disease, and acute and chronic respiratory illnesses including asthma. An estimated seven million individuals die globally every year due to air pollution as the world health organization reported on their website. In this paper, we have proposed an Internet of Things (IoT) based air pollution detection, monitoring, and controlling system. The system detects the various air pollutants by combining the different sensors, helps users to monitor the received pollutants levels over LCD, user's mobile app, and cloud server, and controls the air quality up to a certain level when pollutants levels cross the threshold limits. NodeMCU plays an important role to exchange the data or information between the proposed system devices. We have designed a prototype for demonstrating the proposed system performance. The prototype testing and result show's that the proposed system works significantly well in terms of detection, monitoring, and controlling air pollution, especially proposed controllers exhibit impressive performance for maintaining the air quality.

AB  - Primary recognition of pulmonary cancer nodules eloquently increases the odds of survival, also leads it solider problem to resolve, as it often relies on a tomography scan filmic examination. By increasing the possibility of effective treatment, earlier tumor diagnosis decreases lung cancer mortality. Radiologists usually diagnose lung cancer on medical images by a systematic analysis that consumes more time and is unreliable often, because of the substantial improvement in the transmission of data in the healthcare sector, the protection and integrity of medical data has been a huge problem for healthcare applications. This study utilizes computational intelligence techniques. For detection and data transmission, a novel Hybrid model is therefore proposed in this paper. Two steps are involved in the proposed method where diverse image processing procedures are used to detect cancer in the first step using MATLAB and data transfer to authorized persons via the IoT cloud in the second stage. The simulated steps include preprocessing, segmentation by Otsu thresholding along with swarm intelligence algorithm, extraction of features by local binary pattern and classification using the support vector machine (SVM). This work demonstrates the dominance of swarm-intelligent framework over the conventional algorithms in terms of performance metrics like sensitivity, accuracy and specificity as well as training time. The tests carried out show that the model built can achieve up to 92.96 percent sensitivity, 93.53 percent accuracy and 98.52 percent specificity.

AB  - Background: Internet of Things (IoT) technology enables physiological measurements to be recorded at home from people living with dementia and monitored remotely. However, measurements from people with dementia in this context have not been previously studied. We report on the distribution of physiological measurements from 82 people with dementia over approximately 2 years. Objective: Our objective was to characterize the physiology of people with dementia when measured in the context of their own homes. We also wanted to explore the possible use of an alerts-based system for detecting health deterioration and discuss the potential applications and limitations of this kind of system. Methods: We performed a longitudinal community-based cohort study of people with dementia using "Minder," our IoT remote monitoring platform. All people with dementia received a blood pressure machine for systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a pulse oximeter measuring oxygen saturation and heart rate, body weight scales, and a thermometer, and were asked to use each device once a day at any time. Timings, distributions, and abnormalities in measurements were examined, including the rate of significant abnormalities ("alerts") defined by various standardized criteria. We used our own study criteria for alerts and compared them with the National Early Warning Score 2 criteria. Results: A total of 82 people with dementia, with a mean age of 80.4 (SD 7.8) years, recorded 147,203 measurements over 958,000 participant-hours. The median percentage of days when any participant took any measurements (ie, any device) was 56.2% (IQR 33.2%-83.7%, range 2.3%-100%). Reassuringly, engagement of people with dementia with the system did not wane with time, reflected in there being no change in the weekly number of measurements with respect to time (1-sample t-test on slopes of linear fit, P=.45). A total of 45% of people with dementia met criteria for hypertension. People with dementia with alpha-synuclein-related dementia had lower systolic blood pressure; 30% had clinically significant weight loss. Depending on the criteria used, 3.03%-9.46% of measurements generated alerts, at 0.066-0.233 per day per person with dementia. We also report 4 case studies, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of remote physiological monitoring in people with dementia. These include case studies of people with dementia developing acute infections and one of a person with dementia developing symptomatic bradycardia while taking donepezil. Conclusions: We present findings from a study of the physiology of people with dementia recorded remotely on a large scale. People with dementia and their carers showed acceptable compliance throughout, supporting the feasibility of the system. Our findings inform the development of technologies, care pathways, and policies for IoT-based remote monitoring. We show how IoT-based monitoring could improve the management of acute and chronic comorbidities in this clinically vulnerable group. Future randomized trials are required to establish if a system like this has measurable long-term benefits on health and quality of life outcomes.

AB  - Actigraphy is a tool used to describe limb motor activity. Some actigraphic parameters, namely Motor Activity (MA) and Asymmetry Index (AR), correlate with stroke severity. However, a long-lasting actigraphic monitoring was never performed previously. We hypothesized that MA and AR can describe different clinical conditions during the evolution of the acute phase of stroke. We conducted a multicenter study and enrolled 69 stroke patients. NIHSS was assessed every hour and upper limbs' motor activity was continuously recorded. We calculated MA and AR in the first hour after admission, after a significant clinical change (NIHSS +/- 4) or at discharge. In a control group of 17 subjects, we calculated MA and AR normative values. We defined the best model to predict clinical status with multiple linear regression and identified actigraphic cut-off values to discriminate minor from major stroke (NIHSS >= 5) and NIHSS 5-9 from NIHSS >= 10. The AR cut-off value to discriminate between minor and major stroke (namely NIHSS >= 5) is 27% (sensitivity = 83%, specificity = 76% (AUC 0.86 p < 0.001), PPV = 89%, NPV = 42%). However, the combination of AR and MA of the non-paretic arm is the best model to predict NIHSS score (R-2: 0.482, F: 54.13), discriminating minor from major stroke (sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 82%, PPV = 92%, NPV = 75%). The AR cut-off value of 53% identifies very severe stroke patients (NIHSS >= 10) (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 74% (AUC 0.86 p < 0.001), PPV = 73%, NPV = 82%). Actigraphic parameters can reliably describe the overall severity of stroke patients with motor symptoms, supporting the addition of a wearable actigraphic system to the multi-parametric monitoring in stroke units.

AB  - Chronotherapy is a pharmaceutical intervention that considers the patient's internal circadian time to adjust dosing time. Although it can dramatically improve drug efficacy and reduce toxicity, the large variability in internal time across and within individuals has prevented chronotherapies from progressing beyond clinical trials. To translate chronotherapy developments into a real-world outpatient clinical scenario, a personalized characterization and analysis of a patient's internal time is essential. Here, we describe recent advances in wearable technology that enable real-time high-resolution tracking of circadian and ultradian rhythms. We discuss how integrating wearable data into analysis platforms including systems modeling and machine learning can pave the way toward personalized adaptive chronotherapy.

AB  - In Internet of Things (IoT) era, electronic textiles (E-textiles), which combine various functional devices on a fabric, have attracted attention. Among various components for E-textiles, the human-machine interface device, for example, a keyboard, is one of the most important parts. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can be a powerful sensing component for the interface device due to its cost-effectiveness, design flexibility and self-powered operation. Previous studies reported fabric-based sensor devices with TENG, but as yet, no device that harnesses commercial compatibility with the textile industry has been reported. It is timely to explore a low-cost TENG-based keyboard made completely of commercial fabric for early commercialization. This paper proposes a TENG-based wearable keyboard that uses only cheap commercial fabrics. Each cell in the proposed keyboard generates electrical signals according to an external touch without any power supply. After an appropriate filtering process, the proposed keyboard can detect a key stroke without any ambiguity. We verify the keyboard operation by typing a word and playing music. The material dependency of the proposed keyboard is experimentally validated with various material pairs. Finally, the endurance of the proposed keyboard against folding, repeated touches and washing is experimentally confirmed for actual applications in a real environment.

AB  - Mathematics can be used to analyze and model cardiac arrhythmia. I discuss three different problems. (1) Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation based on the time intervals between subsequent beats. The probability density histograms of the differences of the intervals between consecutive beats have characteristic shapes for atrial fibrillation. (2) Curing atrial fibrillation by ablation of the core of rotors. Recent clinical studies have proposed that ablating the core of rotors in atrial tissue can cure atrial fibrillation. However, the claims are controversial. One problem that arises relates to difficulties associated with developing algorithms to identify the core of rotors. In model tissue culture systems, heterogeneity in the structure makes it difficult to unambiguously locate the core of rotors. (3) Risk stratification for sudden cardiac death (SCD). Despite numerous clinical studies, there is still a need for improved criteria to assess the risk of SCD. I discuss the possibility of using the dynamics of premature ventricular complexes to help make predictions. The development of wearable devices to record and analyze cardiac rhythms offers new prospects for the diagnosis and treatment of cardiac arrhythmia.

AB  - Deploying Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) on/in human bodies has become an increasingly active area of research due to WBANs' capability to monitor human physiological signals, which is useful in a wide range of applications. However, there is a lack of e-learning applications taking advantage of the context-medical data coming from WBANs. This study is aimed at exploring the educational usefulness of integrating data captured by wearable biomedical sensors in a simulation learning environment. To this end, a system has been designed with the aim of introducing 8-12 year old children, newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus, to the endocrine regulation of glucose metabolism processes. The system is evaluated in order to determine whether it is technically viable, and its suitability is validated for educational purposes. Technical viability is evaluated through a simulation, whereas educational usefulness is examined by a group of 13 health professionals in terms of fidelity, validity, interactivity and learning content. The results from this experience highlight the potential of the integration of biomedical sensor data in a simulation learning environment to foster the motivation of the target population and reflection about the health consequences of the patients' actual behaviors. The evaluators see potentials on this proposal and even recommended the incorporation of more biomedical sensors, and new functionalities to share the physiological state of the patients with healthcare stakeholders.

AB  - Neurorehabilitation is progressively shifting from purely in-clinic treatment to therapy that is provided in both clinical and home-based settings. This transition generates a pressing need for assessments that can be performed across the entire continuum of care, a need that might be accommodated by application of wearable sensors. A first step toward ubiquitous assessments is to augment validated and well-understood standard clinical tests. This route has been pursued for the assessment of motor functioning, which in clinical research and practice is observation-based and requires specially trained personnel. In our study, 21 patients performed movement tasks of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), one of the most widely used clinical tests of upper limb motor functioning, while trained evaluators scored each task on pre-defined criteria. We collected data with just two wrist-worn inertial sensors to guarantee applicability across the continuum of care and used machine learning algorithms to estimate the ARAT task scores from sensor-derived features. Tasks scores were classified with approximately 80% accuracy. Linear regression between summed clinical task scores (across all tasks per patient) and estimates of sum task scores yielded a good fit (R-2 = 0.93; range reported in previous studies: 0.61-0.97). Estimates of the sum scores showed a mean absolute error of 2.9 points, 5.1% of the total score, which is smaller than the minimally detectable change and minimally clinically important difference of the ARAT when rated by a trained evaluator. We conclude that it is feasible to obtain accurate estimates of ARAT scores with just two wrist worn sensors. The approach enables administration of the ARAT in an objective, minimally supervised or remote fashion and provides the basis for a widespread use of wearable sensors in neurorehabilitation.

TI  - The Prevention of Senile Diabetes by Smart Wearable Health Monitoring Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - As a chronic disease, diabetes in the elderly patients is incurable and has a long treatment time, most of the symptoms are atypical, and onset is difficult to detect. This is among the challenging issues in front of doctors and paramedical stall and needed to be addressed on a priority basis as it poses a great threat to the health and life of the elderly. At present, the corresponding home medical products and emergency medical equipment cannot provide comprehensive and real-time services for monitoring physical conditions. At present, smart wearable health monitoring products are still in an emerging field. Relying on the advantages of internet technology, actively monitoring the physical condition of elderly diabetic patients is conducive to health protection. This article uses questionnaire surveys and experimental research methods to analyze the information source channels of the elderly diabetic patients interviewed for diabetes and their concerns about using smart wearable health monitoring products and compare their satisfaction with traditional blood glucose monitoring products and smart wearable health monitoring products. According to the investigation results of 50 elderly diabetes patients in P City,, they use TV, newspapers, and magazines to learn more about relevant information. They are mainly worried that they are unfamiliar with the product and will not use the process. Compared with traditional blood glucose monitoring products, smart wearable health monitoring products are satisfied, and degree is higher. Therefore, in order to better let elderly diabetic patients understand their physical condition, they can also effectively avoid the risk factors that may be suffered in life so that the disease can be effectively controlled. Various claims of the proposed scheme are verified through a rigorous evaluation process which is carried out in the form of numerous experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme is an effective way to resolve the aforementioned issue in the hospitals.

AB  - Quantitatively assessing personal health status is gaining increasing attention due to the improvement of diagnostic technology and the increasing occurrence of chronic pathologies. Monitoring physiological parameters allows for retrieving a general overview of the personal health status. Respiratory activity can provide relevant information, especially when pathologies affect the muscles and organs involved in breathing. Among many technologies, wearables may represent a valid solution for continuous and remote monitoring of respiratory activity, thus reducing healthcare costs. The most popular wearables used in this arena are based on detecting the breathing-induced movement of the chest wall. Therefore, their use in patients with impaired chest wall motion and abnormal respiratory kinematics can be challenging, but literature is still in its infancy. This study investigates the performance of a custom wearable device for respiratory monitoring in post-stroke patients. We tested the device on six hemiplegic patients under different respiratory regimes. The estimated respiratory parameters (i.e., respiratory frequency and the timing of the respiratory phase) demonstrated good agreement with the ones provided by a gold standard device. The promising results of this pilot study encourage the exploitation of wearables on these patients that may strongly impact the treatment of chronic diseases, such as hemiplegia.

AB  - The rapid classification of micro-particles has a vast range of applications in biomedical sciences and technology. In the given study, a prototype has been developed for the rapid detection of particle size using multi-angle dynamic light scattering and a machine learning approach by applying a support vector machine. The device consisted of three major parts: a laser light, an assembly of twelve sensors, and a data acquisition system. The laser light with a wavelength of 660 nm was directed towards the prepared sample. The twelve different photosensors were arranged symmetrically surrounding the testing sample to acquire the scattered light. The position of the photosensor was based on the Mie scattering theory to detect the maximum light scattering. In this study, three different spherical microparticles with sizes of 1, 2, and 4 mu m were analyzed for the classification. The real-time light scattering signals were collected from each sample for 30 min. The power spectrum feature was evaluated from the acquired waveforms, and then recursive feature elimination was utilized to filter the features with the highest correlation. The machine learning classifiers were trained using the features with optimum conditions and the classification accuracies were evaluated. The results showed higher classification accuracies of 94.41%, 94.20%, and 96.12% for the particle sizes of 1, 2, and 4 mu m, respectively. The given method depicted an overall classification accuracy of 95.38%. The acquired results showed that the developed system can detect microparticles within the range of 1-4 mu m, with detection limit of 0.025 mg/ml. Therefore, the current study validated the performance of the device, and the given technique can be further applied in clinical applications for the detection of microbial particles.

AB  - Smoking cessation is a significant challenge for many people addicted to cigarettes and tobacco. Mobile health-related research into smoking cessation is primarily focused on mobile phone data collection either using self-reporting or sensor monitoring techniques. In the past five years with the increased popularity of smartwatch devices, research has been conducted to predict smoking movements associated with smoking behaviors based on accelerometer data analyzed from the internal sensors in a user's smartwatch. Previous smoking detection methods focused on classifying current user smoking behavior. For many users who are trying to quit smoking, this form of detection may be insufficient as the user has already relapsed. In this article, we present a smoking cessation system utilizing a smartwatch and finger sensor that is capable of detecting presmoking activities to discourage users from future smoking behavior. Presmoking activities include grabbing a pack of cigarettes or lighting a cigarette and these activities are often immediately succeeded by smoking. Therefore, through accurate detection of presmoking activities, we can alert the user before they have relapsed. Our smoking cessation system combines data from a smartwatch for gross accelerometer and gyroscope information and a wearable finger sensor for detailed finger bend-angle information. We compare the results of a smartwatch-only system with a combined smartwatch and finger sensor system to illustrate the accuracy of each system. The combined smartwatch and finger sensor system performed at an 80.6% accuracy for the classification of presmoking activities compared to 47.0% accuracy of the smartwatch-only system.

AB  - As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)-including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics-as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.

AB  - Cognitive impairment in the elderly causes a significant decline in the quality of life and a substantial economic burden on society. Yet, diagnosing cognitive impairment is apt to be missed or delayed due to its assessment being laborious. This study aimed to propose a new approach of classifying the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly using sequential gait characteristics and machine learning techniques. A total of 108 community-dwelling elderly individuals participated in this study. The participants were categorized into three groups based on their scores of the mini-mental state examination. Each participant completed both the usual- and fast-paced walking on the straight path with two gyroscopes on each foot. By analyzing the foot sagittal angular velocity signals, the temporal gait parameters were extracted from each gait cycle. Five classical machine learning models and a long short-term memory network were respectively employed to produce the classifiers that used the time-consecutive temporal gait parameters as predictors of cognitive impairment. Five-fold cross-validation was applied to 70% of the data in each group, and the remaining 30% were used as test data. An F-1-score of 0.974 was achieved in classifying the three groups by the long short-term memory network-based classifier that used the double-limb support, stance, step, and stride times at usual-paced walking and the double- and single-limb support, stance, and stride times at fast-paced walking as inputs. The proposed approach would pave the way for earlier diagnosis of cognitive impairment in non-clinical settings without professional help, which can facilitate more timely intervention.

AB  - Wearable devices have gained popularity in recent years for tracking metrics related to personal health and well-being such as vital signs, motion, and sleep. Wearable devices are considered to have a very high potential value for detecting, monitoring, and controlling the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19, based on their ability to collect data in a non-invasive and contactless manner. With the Biostrap wrist-worn device (Biostrap USA LLC, Duarte, CA, USA), a commercially available, clinically validated wearable device that uses photoplethysmography to automatically record physiological data such as resting heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and arterial stiffness (AS), we collected biometric data from 933 subjects. We present two cases of patients who have tested positive for the presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), a 24-year-old man experiencing major symptoms and another a 49-year-old man with only intermittent fatigue, and show the marked changes in biometric measurements around dates of symptom onset and positive test. We observed a pattern of sustained respiratory rate elevation in both patients, punctuated by a sharp spike in heart rate and decreased AS. The latter contradicted our expectation that during the onset of symptoms of COVID-19, an increase in AS might occur.

AB  - BackgroundPhysical frailty is a major health concern among people receiving haemodialysis (HD) for stage-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD-5). Wearable accelerometers are increasingly being recommended to objectively monitor activity levels in CKD-5 and recent research suggests they may also represent an innovative strategy to evaluate physical frailty in vulnerable populations. However, no study has yet explored whether wearable accelerometers may be utilised to assess frailty in the context of CKD-5-HD. Therefore, we aimed to examine the diagnostic performance of a research-grade wearable accelerometer in evaluating physical frailty in people receiving HD.MethodsFifty-nine people receiving maintenance HD [age = 62.3 years (SD = 14.9), 40.7% female] participated in this cross-sectional study. Participants wore a uniaxial accelerometer (ActivPAL) for seven consecutive days and the following measures were recorded: total number of daily steps and sit-to-stand transitions, number of daily steps walked with cadence < 60 steps/min, 60-79 steps/min, 80-99 steps/min, 100-119 steps/min, and >= 120 steps/min. The Fried phenotype was used to evaluate physical frailty. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed to examine the diagnostic accuracy of the accelerometer-derived measures in detecting physical frailty status.ResultsParticipants classified as frail (n = 22, 37.3%) had a lower number of daily steps (2363 +/- 1525 vs 3585 +/- 1765, p = 0.009), daily sit-to-stand transitions (31.8 +/- 10.3 vs 40.6 +/- 12.1, p = 0.006), and lower number of steps walked with cadence of 100-119 steps/min (336 +/- 486 vs 983 +/- 797, p < 0.001) compared to their non-frail counterparts. In ROC analysis, the number of daily steps walked with cadence >= 100 steps/min exhibited the highest diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.68-0.92, p < 0.001, cut-off <= 288 steps, sensitivity = 73%, specificity = 76%, PPV = 0.64, NPV = 0.82, accuracy = 75%) in detecting physical frailty.ConclusionsThis study provided initial evidence that a wearable accelerometer may be a useful tool in evaluating physical frailty in people receiving HD. While the total number of daily steps and sit-to-stand transitions could significantly discriminate frailty status, the number of daily steps walked with cadences reflecting moderate to vigorous intensity of walking may be more useful in monitoring physical frailty in people receiving HD.

AB  - This study presents a novel dynamic threshold algorithm that is applied to daily self-measured SpO(2) data for management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients in remote patient monitoring to improve accuracy of detection of exacerbation. Conventional approaches based on a fixed threshold applied to a single SpO2 reading to detect deterioration in patient condition are known to have poor accuracy and result in high false alarm rates. This study develops and evaluates use of a dynamic threshold algorithm to reduce false alarm rates. Daily data from four COPD patients with a record of clinical interventions during the period were selected for analysis. We model the SpO2 time-series data as a combination of a trend and a stochastic component (residual). We estimate the long-term trend using a locally weighed least-squares (low-pass) filter over a long-term processing window. Results show that the time evolution of the long-term trend indicated exacerbation with improved accuracy compared to a fixed threshold in our study population. Deterioration in the condition of a patient also resulted in an increase in the standard deviation of the residual (sres), from 2% or less when the patient is in a healthy condition to 4% or more when condition deteriorates. Statistical analysis of the residuals showed they had a normal distribution when the condition of the patient was stable but had a long tail on the lower side during deterioration.

AB  - The stress-free electrochemical-based sensor equipped with the Internet of Things (IoT) device for salivary creatinine determination was fabricated for point-of-care (POC) diagnosis of advanced kidney disorders. Beneficial and real-time data readout for preventive diagnosis and clinical evaluation of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) at different stages and renal dysfunction can be acquired by noninvasive monitoring of the creatinine amounts in saliva. The direct determination and real-time response of salivary creatinine can be attained using the supercapacitor-based sensor of cuprous oxide nanoparticles entrapped by the synergistically cross-linked poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) gel-Cu2+ and Nafion perfluorinated membrane fabricated on a screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). Here, we demonstrated that the degree of renal illness could be evaluated using salivary creatinine detection via a catalytic mechanism as Cu2+ ions bound irreversibly with C=N functional groups of creatinine. Besides, the computer simulation was performed to study the interaction between 5 functional groups of creatinine toward acrylic gel-Cu2+. The linear increment between the obtained anodic currents and creatinine concentrations varying from 1 to 2000 mu M was accomplished with a selectivity efficiency of 97.2%. Nyquist plots obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) validated that the increment of impedance changes strongly dependent on the amount of detected creatinine both in artificial and in human saliva. The porosity features were observed in this interconnected nanocomposite and correlated with Nafion doping. Successively, the friendly portable device was invented and integrated saliva sampling with miniaturized, low-cost IoT electronics of world-location mapping, representing the first remote medical sensor focusing on salivary creatinine sensing.

AB  - The assessment of walking function alterations is a key issue to design effective rehabilitative interventions in sub-acute stroke patients. Nevertheless, the objective quantification of these alterations remains a challenge.
   Clinical rating scales are commonly used in clinical practice, but have been proven prone to errors associated to the evaluator subjective perception. On the other hand, instrumental measurement of trunk acceleration can be exploited for an objective quantitative characterization of gait function, but it is not applied in routine clinical practice, because the resulting quantitative indexes have not been related to the clinically information, conventionally provided by the rating scales. To overcome this limitation, the relationship between the indexes, in specific clinical conditions, and rating scale must be better investigated, to support their exploitability in the clinical practice as a fast and reliable screening tool.
   Thirty-one sub-acute stroke patients (17 with and 14 without cane) participated in the study. All were assessed with 6 rating scales (MI, TCT, MRI, FAC, WHS, CIRS) and 2 functional tests (2MWT and TUG). Sample Entropy (SEN) and Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) in AP, ML and V directions were calculated over 2MWT and walking section of TUG. The influence of assessment task and cane was analysed, as well as correlation of SEN and RQA indexes with clinical rating scales.
   SEN and RQA on the medio-lateral plane resulted influenced by the use of the cane, while the correlations between indexes and clinical scales showed that SEN and RQA for antero-posterior direction correlate positively with WHS.

AB  - Background Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are one of the major long-term health conditions affecting global healthcare delivery. One of the few effective approaches is to actively manage diabetes via a healthy and active lifestyle.
   Objectives This research is focused on early detection of prediabetes and T2DM using wearable technology and Internet-of-Things-based monitoring applications.
   Methods We developed an artificial intelligence model based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference to detect prediabetes and T2DM via individualized monitoring. The key contributing factors to the proposed model include heart rate, heart rate variability, breathing rate, breathing volume, and activity data (steps, cadence, and calories). The data was collected using an advanced wearable body vest and combined with manual recordings of blood glucose, height, weight, age, and sex. The model analyzed the data alongside a clinical knowledgebase. Fuzzy rules were used to establish baseline values via existing interventions, clinical guidelines, and protocols.
   Results The proposed model was tested and validated using Kappa analysis and achieved an overall agreement of 91%.
   Conclusion We also present a 2-year follow-up observation from the prediction results of the original model. Moreover, the diabetic profile of a participant using M-health applications and a wearable vest (smart shirt) improved when compared to the traditional/routine practice.

AB  - Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) and tetanus are serious infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Tetanus, in particular, has a high mortality rate and its treatment is resource-demanding. Furthermore, HFMD often affects a large number of infants and young children. As a result, its treatment consumes enormous healthcare resources, especially when outbreaks occur. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD) is the main cause of death for both HFMD and tetanus patients. However, early detection of ANSD is a difficult and challenging problem. The authors aim to provide a proof-of-principle to detect the ANSD level automatically by applying machine learning techniques to physiological patient data, such as electrocardiogram waveforms, which can be collected using low-cost wearable sensors. Efficient features are extracted that encode variations in the waveforms in the time and frequency domains. The proposed approach is validated on multiple datasets of HFMD and tetanus patients in Vietnam. Results show that encouraging performance is achieved. Moreover, the proposed features are simple, more generalisable and outperformed the standard heart rate variability analysis. The proposed approach would facilitate both the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries, and thereby improve patient care.

AB  - The healthcare industry requires the integration of digital technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT), to their full potential, particularly during this challenging time and the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the disruptions in healthcare delivery, service operations, and shortage of healthcare personnel. However, every opportunity has barriers and bumps, and when it comes to IoT healthcare, data privacy is one of the main growing issues. Despite the recent advances in the development of IoT healthcare architectures, most of them are invasive for the data subjects. In this context, the broad applications of AI in the IoT domain have also been hindered by emerging strict legal and ethical requirements to protect individual privacy. Camera-based solutions that monitor human subjects in everyday settings, e.g., for Online Range of Motion (ROM) detection, are making this problem even worse. One actively practiced branch of such solutions is telerehabilitation, which provides remote solutions for the physically impaired to regain their strength and get back to their normal daily routines. The process usually involves transmitting video/images from the patient performing rehabilitation exercises and applying Machine Learning (ML) techniques to extract meaningful information to help therapists devise further treatment plans. Thereby, real-time measurement and assessment of rehabilitation exercises in a reliable, accurate, and Privacy-Preserving manner is imperative. To address the privacy issue of existing solutions, this paper proposes a holistic Privacy-Preserving (PP) hierarchical IoT solution that simultaneously addresses the utilization of AI-driven IoT and the demands for data protection. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed architecture is demonstrated by a novel machine learning-based system that allows immediate assessment and extraction of ROM as the critical information for analyzing the progress of patients.

AB  - In this paper, a novel hybrid texture feature set and fractional derivative filter-based breast cancer detection model is introduced. This paper also introduces the application of a histogram of linear bipolar pattern features (HLBP) for breast thermogram classification. Initially, breast tissues are separated by masking operation and filtered by Gru spacing diaeresis mwald-Letnikov fractional derivative-based Sobel mask to enhance the texture and rectify the noise. A novel hybrid feature set using HLBP and other statistical feature sets is derived and reduced by principal component analysis. Radial basis function kernel-based support vector machine is employed for detecting the abnormality in the thermogram. The performance parameters are calculated using five-fold cross-validation scheme using MATLAB 2015a simulation software. The proposed model achieves the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of 94.44%, 95.55%, 92.22%, 96.11%, respectively. A comparative investigation of different texture features with respect to fractional order alpha to classify the breast malignancy is also presented. The proposed model is also compared with a few existing state-of-art schemes which verifies the efficacy of the model. Fractional order alpha offers extra adaptability in overcoming the limitations of thermal imaging techniques and assists radiologists in prior breast cancer detection. The proposed model is more generalized which can be used with different thermal image acquisition protocols and IoT based applications.

AB  - Slowing down the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its adverse health outcomes requires the patient's self-management and attention to treatment recommendations. Information technology (IT)-based interventions are increasingly being used to support self-management in patients with chronic diseases such as CKD. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the features and effects of IT-based interventions on self-management outcomes of CKD patients. A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant papers that were published until May 2016. RCT Studies that assessed at least one automated IT tool in patients with CKD stages 1 to 5, and reported at least one self-management outcome were included. Studies were appraised for quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessment tool. Out of 12,215 papers retrieved, eight study met the inclusion criteria. Interventions were delivered via smartphones/personal digital assistants (PDAs) (three studies), wearable devices (three studies), computerized systems (one study), and multiple component (one study). The studies assessed 15 outcomes, including eight clinical outcomes and seven process of care outcomes. In 12 (80%) of the 15 outcomes, the studies had revealed the effects of the interventions as statistically significant positive. These positive effects were observed in 75% of the clinical outcomes and 86% of the process of care outcomes. The evidence indicates the potential of IT-based interventions (i.e. smartphones/PDAs, wearable devices, and computerized systems) in self-management outcomes (clinical and process of care outcomes) of CKD patients.

AB  - Introduction: Informal caregiving is an essential element of health-care delivery. Little data describes how caregivers structure care recipients' lives and impact their functional status.
   Methods: We performed observational studies of community dwelling persons with dementia (PWD) to measure functional status by simultaneous assessment of physical activity (PA) and lifespace (LS). We present data from two caregiver/care-recipient dyads representing higher and average degrees of caregiver involvement.
   Results: We acquired >42,800 (subject 1); >41,300 (subject 2) PA data points and >154,500 (subject 1); >119,700 (subject 2) LS data points over 15 months of near continuous observation. PA and LS patterns provided insights into the caregiver's role in structuring the PWD's day-to-day function and change in function over time.
   Discussion: We show that device-enabled functional monitoring (FM) can successfully gather and display data at resolutions required for dementia care studies. Objective quantification of individual caregiver/care-recipient dyads provides opportunities to implement patient-centered care.

AB  - Objective The objective of this study was to ascertain whether wearable technology coupled with action planning was effective in increasing physical activity (PA) in colorectal and endometrial cancer survivors at cardiovascular risk. Methods Sixty-eight survivors who had cardiovascular risk factors and were insufficiently active were randomized to intervention and control arms. Intervention participants were given a wearable tracker for 12 weeks, two group sessions, and a support phone call. Participants in the control arm received print materials describing PA guidelines. Assessments at baseline and 12 weeks measured triaxial and uniaxial estimates of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behaviour, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). Results The intervention group significantly increased MVPA by 45 min/wk compared with a reduction of 21 min/wk in the control group. Group by time interactions were significant for minutes of MVPA (F-1,F-126 = 5.14, P = 0.025). For those with diastolic hypertension, there was a significant group by time interaction (F-1,F-66 = 4.89, P = 0.031) with a net reduction of 9.89 mm Hg in the intervention group. Conclusions Significant improvements in MVPA were observed following the intervention. The results display promise for the use of pragmatic, low-intensity interventions using wearable technology.

AB  - In present digital era, an exponential increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices poses several design issues for business concerning security and privacy. Earlier studies indicate that the blockchain technology is found to be a significant solution to resolve the challenges of data security exist in IoT. In this view, this paper presents a new privacy-preserving Secure Ant Colony optimization with Multi Kernel Support Vector Machine (ACOMKSVM) with Elliptical Curve cryptosystem (ECC) for secure and reliable IoT data sharing. This program uses blockchain to ensure protection and integrity of some data while it has the technology to create secure ACOMKSVM training algorithms in partial views of IoT data, collected from various data providers. Then, ECC is used to create effective and accurate privacy that protects ACOMKSVM secure learning process. In this study, the authors deployed blockchain technique to create a secure and reliable data exchange platform across multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and recorded in a distributed ledger. The security analysis showed that the specific data ensures confidentiality of critical data from each data provider and protects the parameters of the ACOMKSVM model for data analysts. To examine the performance of the proposed method, it is tested against two benchmark dataset such as Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set (BCWD) and Heart Disease Data Set (HDD) from UCI AI repository. The simulation outcome indicated that the ACOMKSVM model has outperformed all the compared methods under several aspects.

AB  - A portable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system is essential for elderly and remote patients who are not able to visit the hospital regularly. The system connects a patient to his/her doctor through an Internet of Things (IoT) cloud server that provides all the information needed to diagnose heart diseases. Patients use an ECG monitoring device to collect and upload information regarding their current medical situation via the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol to the server. The IoT cloud server performs further analysis that can be useful for both the doctor and the patient. Moreover, the proposed system has an alert mechanism that sends notifications when a certain threshold is reached. The monitoring system accepts two types of input data: real-time data that are collected by an ECG device and benchmark data from the PhysioNet ECG-ID database. The system framework has four components: input, embedded device, IoT cloud server, and interface. Herein, two experiments are conducted using both types of input data. The results show that the proposed system provides reliable and trusted results that might reduce the number of required hospital visits. A comparison between the proposed system and several techniques previously reported in the literature is conducted. Finally, an implementation of the proposed system is presented to illustrate its operation.

AB  - The use of expert systems in optimizing and transforming human performance has been limited in practice due to the lack of understanding of how an individual's performance deteriorates with fatigue accumulation, which can vary based on both the worker and the workplace conditions. As a first step toward realizing the human-centered approach to artificial intelligence and expert systems, this paper lays the foundation for a data analytic approach to managing fatigue in physically-demanding workplaces. The proposed framework capitalizes on continuously collected human performance data from wearable sensor technologies, and is centered around four distinct phases of fatigue: (a) detection, where machine learning methodologies are deployed to detect the occurrence of fatigue; (b) identification, where key features relating to the fatigue occurrence is to be identified; (c) diagnosis, where the fatigue mode is identified based on the knowledge generated in the previous two phases; and (d) recovery, where a suitable intervention is applied to return the worker to mitigate the detrimental effects of fatigue on the worker. Moreover, the framework establishes criteria for feature and machine learning algorithm selection for fatigue management. Two specific application cases of the framework, for two types of manufacturing-related tasks, are presented. Based on the proposed framework and a large number of test sets used in the two case studies, we have shown that: (i) only one wearable sensor is needed for fatigue detection with an average accuracy of >= 0.850 and a random forest model comprised of < 7 features; and (ii) the selected features are task-dependent, and thus capturing different modes of fatigue. Therefore, this research presents an important foundation for future expert systems that attempt to quantify/predict changes in workers' performance as an input to prescriptive rest-break scheduling, job-rotation, and task assignment models. To encourage future work in this important area, we provide links to our data and code as Supplementary materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Rare disease
   Background: Wearable smartphone-enabled cardiac monitoring devices can aid the diagnosis of asymptomatic tachycardia in neonates and infants. This report is of a rare case of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia of Belhassen type detected in a neonate by 'smart sock' cardiac monitoring.
   Case Report: A premature baby boy at 37 weeks gestational age was discharged home after three days without complication, and was given 'smart socks' to wear. He was followed up daily for the management of hyperbilirubinemia, which was treated in the outpatient clinic with a phototherapy blanket. He was admitted to the emergency room (ER) at 6 days of age because his 'smart socks' identified a tachycardia of between 180-200 bpm. His parents reported no fever, cough, nasal congestion, or emesis. On examination in the ER, he was alert with no distress. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a sustained monomorphic and wide QRS tachycardia with a heart rate of 200 bpm, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and a superior axis that was compatible with a diagnosis of left posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia of Belhassen type. The echocardiogram showed a structurally normal heart with normal cardiac function. His tachycardia spontaneously converted to normal sinus rhythm after four hours. He was discharged home three days later without further episodes of tachycardia. Cardiac monitoring using 'smart socks' continued at home, and no further arrhythmias were detected at one year of age.
   Conclusions: The home use of smartphone-enabled technology to monitor the neonatal and infant cardiac heart rate can identify asymptomatic arrhythmias.

AB  - The mortality rate of heart disease continues to rise each year: developing mechanisms to reduce mortality from heart disease is a top concern in today's society. Heart sound auscultation is a crucial skill used to detect and diagnose heart disease. In this study, we propose a heart sound signal classification algorithm based on a convolutional neural network. The algorithm is based on heart sound data collected in the clinic and from medical books. The heart sound signals were first preprocessed into a grayscale image of 5 seconds. The training samples were then used to train and optimize the convolutional neural network; obtaining a training result with an accuracy of 95.17% and a loss value of 0.23. Finally, the convolutional neural network was used to test the test set samples. The results showed an accuracy of 94.80%, sensitivity of 94.29%, specificity of 95.54%, precision of 93.44%, F1_score of 93.84%, and an AUC of 0.943. Compared with other algorithms, the accuracy and sensitivity of the algorithms were improved. This shows that the method used in this study can effectively classify heart sound signals and could prove useful in assisting heart sound auscultation.

AB  - Due to the decline in functional capability, older adults are more likely to encounter excessively demanding environmental conditions (that result in stress and/or mobility limitation) than the average person. Current efforts to detect such environmental conditions are inefficient and are not person-centered. This study presents a more efficient and person-centered approach that involves using wearable sensors to collect continuous bodily responses (i.e., electroencephalography, photoplethysmography, electrodermal activity, and gait) and location data from older adults to detect demanding environmental conditions. Computationally, this study developed a Random Forest algorithm-considering the informativeness of the bodily response-and a hot spot analysis-based approach to identify environmental locations with high demand. The approach was tested on data collected from 10 older adults during an outdoor environmental walk. The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can detect demanding environmental conditions that are likely to result in stress and/or limited mobility for older adults.

AB  - Precision nutrition is a popular eHealth topic among several groups, such as athletes, people with dementia, rare diseases, diabetes, and overweight. Its implementation demands tight nutrition control, starting with nutritionists who build up food plans for specific groups or individuals. Each person then follows the food plan by preparing meals and logging all food and water intake. However, the discipline demanded to follow food plans and log food intake results in high dropout rates. This article presents the concepts, requirements, and architecture of a solution that assists the nutritionist in building up and revising food plans and the user following them. It does so by minimizing human-computer interaction by integrating the nutritionist and user systems and introducing off-the-shelf IoT devices in the system, such as temperature sensors, smartwatches, smartphones, and smart bottles. An interaction time analysis using the keystroke-level model provides a baseline for comparison in future work addressing both the use of machine learning and IoT devices to reduce the interaction effort of users.

AB  - Objective. Detecting different cardiac diseases using a single or reduced number of leads is still challenging. This work aims to provide and validate an automated method able to classify ECG recordings. Performance using complete 12-lead systems, reduced lead sets, and single-lead ECGs is evaluated and compared. Approach. Seven different databases with 12-lead ECGs were provided during the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2021, where 88 253 annotated samples associated with none, one, or several cardiac conditions among 26 different classes were released for training, whereas 42 896 hidden samples were used for testing. After signal preprocessing, 81 features per ECG-lead were extracted, mainly based on heart rate variability, QRST patterns and spectral domain. Next, a One-versus-Rest classification approach made of independent binary classifiers for each cardiac condition was trained. This strategy allowed each ECG to be classified as belonging to none, one or several classes. For each class, a classification model among two binary supervised classifiers and one hybrid unsupervised-supervised classification system was selected. Finally, we performed a 3-fold cross-validation to assess the system's performance. Main results. Our classifiers received scores of 0.39, 0.38, 0.39, 0.38, and 0.37 for the 12, 6, 4, 3 and 2-lead versions of the hidden test set with the Challenge evaluation metric ( CM <i ). Also, we obtained a mean G <i-score of 0.80, 0.78, 0.79, 0.79, 0.77 and 0.74 for the 12, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1-lead subsets with the public training set during our 3-fold cross-validation. Significance. We proposed and tested a machine learning approach focused on flexibility for identifying multiple cardiac conditions using one or more ECG leads. Our minimal-lead approach may be beneficial for novel portable or wearable ECG devices used as screening tools, as it can also detect multiple and concurrent cardiac conditions.

AB  - Background: Physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of numerous types of cancer and plays an important role in maintaining a healthy weight. Wearable physical activity trackers may supplement behavioral intervention and enable researchers to study how determinants like self-efficacy predict physical activity patterns over time.
   Methods: We used multistate models to evaluate how self-efficacy predicted physical activity states among overweight and obese individuals participating in a 26-week weight loss program (N = 96). We specified five states to capture physical activity patterns: (i) active (i.e., meeting recommendations for 2 weeks), (ii) insufficiently active, (iii) nonvalid wear, (iv) favorable transition (i.e., improvement in physical activity over 2 weeks), and (v) unfavorable transition. We calculated HRs of transition probabilities by self-efficacy, body mass index, age, and time.
   Results: The average prevalence of individuals in the active, insufficiently active, and nonvalid wear states was 13%, 44%, and 16%, respectively. Low self-efficacy negatively predicted entering an active state [HR, 0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.29-0.88]. Obesity negatively predicted making a favorable transition out of an insufficiently active state (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.91). Older participants were less likely to transition to the nonvalid wear state (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.93). Device nonwear increased in the second half of the intervention (HR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.07-2.81).
   Conclusions: Self-efficacy is an important predictor for clinically relevant physical activity change in overweight and obese individuals. Multistate modeling is useful for analyzing longitudinal physical activity data.
   Impact: Multistate modeling can be used for statistical inference of covariates and allow for explicit modeling of nonvalid wear.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a health apprehension of significant proportions that is negatively impacting the ageing population globally. It is characterized by neuronal loss and the formation of structures such as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the early as well as later stages of the disease. Neuroimaging modalities are routinely used in clinical practice to capture brain alterations associated with AD. On the other hand, deep learning methods are routinely used to recognize patterns in underlying data distributions effectively. This work uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures in both 2D and 3D domains to classify the initial stages of AD into AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Control (NC) classes using the positron emission tomography neuroimaging modality deploying data augmentation in a random zoomed in/out scheme. We used novel concepts such as the blurring before subsampling principle and distant domain transfer learning to build 2D CNN architectures. We performed three binaries, that is, AD/NC, AD/MCI, MCI/NC and one multiclass classification task AD/NC/MCI. The statistical comparison revealed that 3D-CNN architecture performed the best achieving an accuracy of 89.21% on AD/NC, 71.70% on AD/MCI, 62.25% on NC/MCI and 59.73% on AD/NC/MCI classification tasks using a five-fold cross-validation hyperparameter selection approach. Data augmentation helps in achieving superior performance on the multiclass classification task. The obtained results support the application of deep learning models towards early recognition of AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of disability resulting in long-term functional ambulation deficits. Conventional therapy can improve ambulation, but may not be able to provide consistent, high dose repetition of movement, resulting in variable recovery with residual gait deviations.
   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this preliminary prospective investigation is to evaluate the ability of a robotic exoskeleton (RE) to provide high dose gait training, and measure the resulting therapeutic effect on functional ambulation in adults with acute stroke.
   METHODS: Participants (n = 14) received standard of care (SOC) and RE overground gait training during their scheduled physical therapy (PT) sessions at the same inpatient rehabilitation facility. The outcome measures included distance walked during their PT training sessions (RE and SOC), and functional ambulation measures (10-meterwalk test (10MWT), 6-minute walk test (6 MWT), and timed up and go (TUG)).
   RESULTS: The average total distance walked during RE and the average distance per RE session was significantly higher than SOC sessions. Total walking distance during PT (RE+SOC) showed a strong positive correlation to the total number of steps during RE sessions and number of RE sessions. All functional ambulation measures showed significant improvement at follow-up compared to baseline. The improvement in functional ambulation measures showed a positive correlation with the increase in number of RE gait training sessions.
   CONCLUSION: The RE can be utilized for inpatient rehabilitation in conjunction with SOC gait training sessions and may result in improved functional ambulation in adults with acute stroke. This preliminary research provides information on the ability of the robotic exoskeleton to provide high dose therapy and its therapeutic effect on functional ambulation in adults with acute stroke during inpatient rehabilitation.

AB  - While the number of women with Coronary Heart Disease requiring cardiac rehabilitation (CR) continues to increase, lack of access and other barriers to center-based CR present significant challenges. A mobile phone and wearable device-based technological system can offer home-based secondary prevention program for CHD. We have designed a women-specific digital health intervention system for use in a home-based CR program. The system that we have proposed combines human-expert intelligence with machine intelligence to enhance the decision-making capability of a health coach. We have evaluated the prototype of our system with eight women with CHD for over 13 weeks. The evaluation has shown a significant positive impact of preprogrammed intervention messages on participants' walking performance on the same and the next day. Since increased walking activities directly improve heart health, we can directly infer that our proposed system is beneficial as a tool for secondary prevention among women with CHD.

AB  - A potential dramatic effect of long-term disability due to stroke is the inability to return to work. An accurate prognosis and the identification of the parameters inflating the possibility of return to work after neurorehabilitation are crucial. Many factors may influence it, such as mobility and, in particular, walking ability. In this pilot study, two emerging technologies have been combined with the aim of developing a prognostic tool for identifying patients able to return to work: a wearable inertial measurement unit for gait analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN). Compared with more conventional statistics, the ANN showed a higher accuracy in identifying patients with respect to healthy subjects (90.9 vs. 75.8%) and also in identifying the subjects unable to return to work (93.9 vs. 81.8%). In this last analysis, the duration of double support phase resulted the most important input of the ANN. The potentiality of the ANN, developed also in other fields such as marketing on social networks, could allow a powerful support for clinicians that today should manage a large amount of instrumentally recorded parameters in patients with stroke.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common sustained chronic cardiac arrhythmia in elderly population, associated with a high mortality and morbidity in stroke, heart failure, coronary artery disease, systemic thromboembolism, etc. The early detection of AF is necessary for averting the possibility of disability or mortality. However, AF detection remains problematic due to its episodic pattern. In this paper, a multiscaled fusion of deep convolutional neural network (MS-CNN) is proposed to screen out AF recordings from single lead short electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings. The MS-CNN employs the architecture of two-stream convolutional networks with different filter sizes to capture features of different scales. The experimental results show that the proposed MS-CNN achieves 96.99% of classification accuracy on ECG recordings cropped/padded to 5 s. Especially, the best classification accuracy, 98.13%, is obtained on ECG recordings of 20 s. Compared with artificial neural network, shallow single-stream CNN, and Visual-Geometry group network, the MS-CNN can achieve the better classification performance. Meanwhile, visualization of the learned features from the MS-CNN demonstrates its superiority in extracting linear separable ECG features without hand-craft feature engineering. The excellent AF screening performance of the MS-CNN can satisfy the most elders for daily monitoring with wearable devices.

AB  - Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) and analytic-based systems in the past decade have found several applications in medical informatics, and have significantly facilitated healthcare decision making. Patients' data are collected through a variety of means, including IoT sensory systems, and require efficient, and accurate processing. Topic Modelling is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for Natural Language Processing (NLP) that identifies relationships and associations within textual data. The application of Topic Modelling has been widely used on raw text data, where meaningful clusters (topics) are generated by the model. The purpose of this paper is to explore the varying methods of Topic Modelling, mostly the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, and its applicability on personalized diabetes management. The proposed study evaluates the possibility of applying topic modelling methods on diabetes literature and genomic data in order to achieve precision medicine.

AB  - Objective: Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) is a commonly underdiagnosed disease with severe consequences and an exceedingly high mortality rate. Conventional compression wraps are devised for therapeutic purpose but lack diagnostic capacity. Recent advances in flexible electronics and wearable technologies offer many possibilities for chronic disease management. In particular, vital signs have been studied to show a strong correlation with the risk of VTE patients. In this study, we aim to develop an intelligent theranostic compression device, referred to as iWRAP, with the built-in capacity of real-time vital sign monitoring together with auto-adjustable compression level. Methods: An instantaneous pneumatic feedback control with a high-resolution pressure sensor is integrated to provide a highly stabilized compression level at the prescribed interface pressure for an improved therapeutic outcome. Meanwhile, arterial pulse waveforms extracted from the pressure readings from the smart compression device can be utilized to derive the body vital signs, including heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and blood pressure (BP). Results: A reliable delivery of the targeted compression level within +/- 5% accuracy in the range of 20-60 mmHg has been achieved through the feedback of the interface pressure. Both HR and RR have been measured within clinical-grade accuracies. Moreover, BP estimated using an ALA model has been achieved at low compression levels, which is also within a clinical-acceptable accuracy. The acquired vital information has been instantaneously fit into the clinically acceptable criteria for life-threatening PE risk with timely assessments. Conclusion: The iWRAP has shown the potential to become the first theranostic wearable device with both continuous delivery of accurate and effective compression therapy and real-time monitoring of life-threatening conditions for VTE patients.

AB  - Mechanical ventilation (MV) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are the only viable treatment options for lung failure patients at the end-stage, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These treatments, however, are associated with high morbidity and mortality because of long wait times for lung transplant. Contemporary clinical literature has shown ambulation improves post-transplant outcomes in lung failure patients. Given this, we are developing the Pittsburgh Ambulatory Assist Lung (PAAL), a truly wearable artificial lung that allows for ambulation. In this study, we targeted 180 ml/min oxygenation and determined the form factor for a hollow fiber membrane (HFM) bundle for the PAAL. Based on a previously published mass transfer correlation, we modeled oxygenation efficiency as a function of fiber bundle diameter. Three benchmark fiber bundles were fabricated to validate the model through in vitro blood gas exchange at blood flow rates from 1 to 4 L/min according to ASTM standards. We used the model to determine a final design, which was characterized in vitro through a gas exchange as well as a hemolysis study at 3.5 L/min. The percent difference between model predictions and experiment for the benchmark bundles ranged from 3% to 17.5% at the flow rates tested. Using the model, we predicted a 1.75 in diameter bundle with 0.65 m(2) surface area would produce 180 ml/min at 3.5 L/min blood flow rate. The oxygenation efficiency was 278 ml/min/m(2) and the Normalized Index of Hemolysis (NIH) was less than 0.05 g/100 L. Future work involves integrating this bundle into the PAAL for which an experimental prototype is under development in our laboratory.

AB  - Designing highly active material to fabricate a high-performance noninvasive wearable glucose sensor was of great importance for diabetes monitoring. In this work, we developed CuxO nanoflakes (NFs)/Cu nanoparticles (NPs) nanocomposites to serve as the sensing materials for noninvasive sweat-based wearable glucose sensors. We involve CuCl2 to enhance the oxidation of Cu NPs to generate Cu2O/CuO NFs on the surface. Due to more active sites endowed by the CuxO NFs, the as-prepared sample exhibited high sensitivity (779 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)) for noninvasive wearable sweat sensing. Combined with a low detection limit (79.1 nM), high selectivity and the durability of bending and twisting, the CuxO NFs/Cu NPs-based sensor can detect the glucose level change of sweat in daily life. Such a high-performance wearable sensor fabricated by a convenient method provides a facile way to design copper oxide nanomaterials for noninvasive wearable glucose sensors.

AB  - The elderly is a continuous growth sector thanks to the life expectancy increase in Western society. This sector is especially at risk from the appearance of respiratory diseases and, therefore, is the most affected sector in the COVID-19 epidemic. Many of these elderly require continuous care in residences or by specialized caregivers, but these personal contacts put this sector at risk. In this work, an IoT system for elderly remote monitoring is studied, designed, developed and tested. This system is composed by a smart garment that records information from various physiological sensors in order to detect falls, sudden changes in body temperature, heart problems and heat stroke; This information is sent to a cloud server through a gateway located in the patient's residence, allowing to real-time monitor remotely patient's activity using a customized App, as well as receiving alerts in dangerous situations. This system has been tested with professional caregivers, obtaining usability and functionality surveys; and, in addition, a detailed power-consumption study has been carried out. The results, compared with other similar systems, demonstrate that the proposed one is useful, usable, works in real time and has a decent power consumption that allows the patient to carry it during all day without charging the battery.

AB  - CONSPECTUS: Wearable biosensors hold the potential of revolutionizing personalized healthcare and telemedicine. Advances in chemical sensing, flexible materials, and scalable manufacturing techniques now allow wearables to detect key physiological indicators such as temperature, vital signs, body motion, and molecular biomarkers. With these systems operating on the skin, they enable continuous and noninvasive disease diagnosis and health monitoring. Such complex devices, however, require suitable power sources in order to realize their full capacity. Emerging wearable energy harvesters are attractive for addressing the challenges of a wearable power supply. These harvesters convert various types of ambient energy sources (e.g., biomechanical energy, biochemical energy, and solar energy) into electricity. In some circumstances, the harvested electrical signals can directly be used for active sensing of physiological parameters. On the other hand, single or hybrid wearable energy harvesters, when integrated with power management circuits and energy storage devices, could power additional biosensors as well as signal processing and data transmission electronics. Self-powered sensor systems operate continuously and sustainably without an external power supply are promising candidates in the next generation of wearable electronics and the Internet of Things.
   This Account highlights recent progress in self-powered wearable sensors toward personalized healthcare, covering biosensors, energy harvesters, energy storage, and power supply strategies. The Account begins with an introduction of our wearable biosensors toward an epidermal detection of physiological information. Advances in structural and material innovations enable wearable systems to measure both biophysical and biochemical indicators conformably, accurately, and continuously. We then discuss emerging technologies in wearable energy harvesting, classified according to their capability to scavenge energy from various sources. These include examples of using energy harvesters themselves as active biosensors. Through seamless integration and efficient power management, self-powered wireless wearable sensor systems allow real-time data acquisition, processing, and transmission for health monitoring. The final section of the Account covers the existing challenges and new opportunities for self-powered wearable sensors in health monitoring and human-machine interfaces toward personalized and precision medicine.

AB  - Single resident life style is increasing among the elderly due to the issues of elderly care cost and privacy invasion. However, the single life style cannot be maintained if they have dementia. Thus, the early detection of dementia is crucial. Systems with wearable devices or cameras are not preferred choice for the long-term monitoring. Main intention of this paper is to propose deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) classifier for indoor travel patterns of elderly people living alone using open data set collected by device-free non-privacy invasive binary (passive infrared) sensor data. Travel patterns are classified as direct, pacing, lapping, or random according to Martino-Saltzman (MS) model. MS travel pattern is highly related with person's cognitive state, and thus can be used to detect early stage of dementia. We have utilized an open data set that was presented by Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems project, Washington State University. The data set was collected by monitoring a cognitively normal elderly person by wireless passive infrared sensors for 21 months. First, 117 320 travel episodes are extracted from the data set and classified by MS travel pattern classifier algorithm for the ground truth. Later, 12 000 episodes (3000 for each pattern) were randomly selected from the total episodes to compose training and testing data set. Finally, DCNN performance was compared with seven other classical machine-learning classifiers. The random forest and DCNN yielded the best classification accuracies of 94.48% and 97.84%, respectively. Thus, the proposed DCNN classifier can be used to infer dementia through travel pattern matching.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has tremendously spread worldwide, and it influenced the world through easy connectivity, interoperability, and interconnectivity using IoT devices. Numerous techniques have been developed using IoT-enabled health care systems for cancer detection, but some limitations exist in transmitting the health data to the cloud. The limitations can be accomplished using the proposed chronological-based social optimization algorithm (CBSOA) that effectively transmits the patient's health data using IoT network, thereby detecting lung cancer in an effective way. Initially, nodes in the IoT network are simulated such that patient's health data are collected, and for transmission of such data, routing is performed in order to transmit the health data from source to destination through a gateway based on cloud service using CBSOA. The fitness is newly modeled by assuming the factors like energy, distance, trust, delay, and link quality. Finally, lung cancer detection is carried out at the destination point. At the destination point, the acquired input data is fed to preprocessing phase to make the data acceptable for further mechanism using data normalization. Once the feature selection is done using Canberra distance, then the lung cancer detection is performed using shepard convolutional neural network (ShCNN). The process of routing as well as training of ShCNN is performed using the CBSOA algorithm, which is devised by the inclusion of the chronological concept into the social optimization algorithm. The proposed approach has achieved a maximum accuracy of 0.940, maximum sensitivity of 0.941, maximum specificity of 0.928, and minimum energy of 0.452.

AB  - The clinical treatment planning of coronary heart disease requires hemodynamic parameters to provide proper guidance. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is gradually used in the simulation of cardiovascular hemodynamics. However, for the patient-specific model, the complex operation and high computational cost of CFD hinder its clinical application. To deal with these problems, we develop cardiovascular hemodynamic point datasets and a dual sampling channel deep learning network, which can analyze and reproduce the relationship between the cardiovascular geometry and internal hemodynamics. The statistical analysis shows that the hemodynamic prediction results of deep learning are in agreement with the conventional CFD method, but the calculation time is reduced 600-fold. In terms of over 2 million nodes, prediction accuracy of around 90%, computational efficiency to predict cardiovascular hemodynamics within 1 second, and universality for evaluating complex arterial system, our deep learning method can meet the needs of most situations. Anzai et al. propose a deep learning approach to estimate the 3D hemodynamics of complex aorta-coronary artery geometry in the context of coronary artery bypass surgery. Their method reduces the calculation time 600-fold, while allowing high resolution and similar accuracy as traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method.

AB  - Background: Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) experience severe side effects during radiotherapy (RT). Ongoing technological advances in wearable biometric sensors allow for the collection of objective data (eg, physical activity and heart rate), which might, in the future, help detect and counter side effects before they become severe. A smartwatch such as the Apple Watch allows for objective data monitoring outside the hospital with minimal effort from the patient. To determine whether such tools can be implemented in the oncological setting, feasibility studies are needed.
   Objective: This protocol describes the design of the OncoWatch 1.0 feasibility study that assesses the adherence of patients with HNC to an Apple Watch during RT.
   Methods: A prospective, single-cohort trial will be conducted at the Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet (Copenhagen, Denmark) Patients aged >= 18 years intended for primary or postoperative curatively intended RT for HNC will be recruited. Consenting patients will be asked to wear an Apple Watch on the wrist during and until 2 weeks after RT. The study will include 10 patients. Data on adherence, data acquisition, and biometric data will be collected. Demographic data, objective toxicity scores, and hospitalizations will be documented.
   Results: The primary outcome is to determine if it is feasible for the patients to wear a smartwatch continuously (minimum 12 hours/day) during RT. Furthermore, we will explore how the heart rate and physical activity change over the treatment course.
   Conclusions: The study will assess the feasibility of using the Apple Watch for home monitoring of patients with HNC. Our findings may provide novel insights into the patient's activity levels and variations in heart rate during the treatment course. The knowledge obtained from this study will be essential for further investigating how biometric data can be used as part of symptom monitoring for patients with HNC.

AB  - Freezing of gait (FOG), a debilitating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), can be safely studied using the stepping in place (SIP) task. However, clinical, visual identification of FOG during SIP is subjective and time consuming, and automatic FOG detection during SIP currently requires measuring the center of pressure on dual force plates. This study examines whether FOG elicited during SIP in 10 individuals with PD could be reliably detected using kinematic data measured from wearable inertial measurement unit sensors (IMUs). A general, logistic regression model (area under the curve = 0.81) determined that three gait parameters together were overall the most robust predictors of FOG during SIP: arrhythmicity, swing time coefficient of variation, and swing angular range. Participant-specific models revealed varying sets of gait parameters that best predicted FOG for each participant, highlighting variable FOG behaviors, and demonstrated equal or better performance for 6 out of the 10 participants, suggesting the opportunity for model personalization. The results of this study demonstrated that gait parameters measured from wearable IMUs reliably detected FOG during SIP, and the general and participant-specific gait parameters allude to variable FOG behaviors that could inform more personalized approaches for treatment of FOG and gait impairment in PD.

AB  - Background: New models of scalable population-based data collection that integrate digital and mobile health (mHealth) data are necessary.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to describe a cardiovascular digital and mHealth electronic cohort (e-cohort) embedded in a traditional longitudinal cohort study, the Framingham Heart Study (FHS).
   Methods: We invited eligible and consenting FHS Generation 3 and Omni participants to download the electronic Framingham Heart Study (eFHS) app onto their mobile phones and co-deployed a digital blood pressure (BP) cuff. Thereafter, participants were also offered a smartwatch (Apple Watch). Participants are invited to complete surveys through the eFHS app, to perform weekly BP measurements, and to wear the smartwatch daily.
   Results: Up to July 2017, we enrolled 790 eFHS participants, representing 76% (790/1044) of potentially eligible FHS participants. eFHS participants were, on average, 53 +/- 8 years of age and 57% were women. A total of 85% (675/790) of eFHS participants completed all of the baseline survey and 59% (470/790) completed the 3-month survey. A total of 42% (241/573) and 76% (306/405) of eFHS participants adhered to weekly digital BP and heart rate (HR) uploads, respectively, over 12 weeks.
   Conclusions: We have designed an e-cohort focused on identifying novel cardiovascular disease risk factors using a new smartphone app, a digital BP cuff, and a smartwatch. Despite minimal training and support, preliminary findings over a 3-month follow-up period show that uptake is high and adherence to periodic app-based surveys, weekly digital BP assessments, and smartwatch HR measures is acceptable.

AB  - Objective Moderate-to-severe hemorrhage is a life-threatening condition, which is challenging to detect in a timely fashion using traditional vital signs because of the human body's robust physiologic compensatory mechanisms. Measuring and trending blood flow could improve diagnosis of clinically significant exsanguination. A lightweight, wireless, wearable Doppler ultrasound patch that captures and trends blood flow velocity could enhance hemorrhage detection. Methods In 11 healthy volunteers undergoing simulated hemorrhage and resuscitation during graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and release, we studied the relationship between stroke volume (SV) and common carotid artery velocity time integral (VTI) and corrected flow time (FTc). We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of 2 variations of a novel metric, the Doppler shock index (ie, the DSIVTI and DSIFTc), at capturing moderate-to-severe central hypovolemia defined as a 30% reduction in SV. The DSIVTI and DSIFTc are calculated as the heart rate divided by either the VTI or FTc, respectively. Results A total of 17,822 cardiac cycles were analyzed across 22 LBNP protocols. The average SV reduction to the lowest tolerated LBNP stage was 40%; there was no clinically significant fall in the mean arterial pressure. Correlations between changing SV and the common carotid artery VTI and FTc were strong (R-2 of 0.87, respectively) and concordant. The DSIVTI and DSIFTc accurately detected moderate-to-severe central hypovolemia with values for the area under the receiver operator curves of 0.96 and 0.97, respectively. Conclusion In a human model of hemorrhage and resuscitation, measures from a wearable Doppler ultrasound patch correlated strongly with SV and identified moderate-to-severe central hypovolemia with excellent diagnostic accuracy.

AB  - The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the "Internet of Medical Things" (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning.

AB  - center dot There has been a technological boom in the field of digital health care that includes wearables and sensor-based technologies. This has been brought to the forefront especially in the field of cardiovascular medicine and more specifically in the care of patients with heart failure (HF) cohort with a renewed approach at disease monitoring and risk stratification of the patients with HF. center dot Although there continues to be a deluge of software platforms for remote patient monitoring (RPM), clinical trials have offered discrepant results as to whether this strategy truly impacts major outcomes such as HF hospitalizations or cardiovascular mortality as compared with standard of care. center dot The HF population is particularly challenging given the high degree of disease heterogeneity, an elderly and aging patient cohort, and the difficulty of fully capturing the overall risk trajectory of thepatients with HF with any single data parameter offered by a digital device. center dot We propose a new framework of "Digital Phenotypes in HF" for how new devices and sensors and their respective datasets can be leveraged to guide tailored therapy and predict disease progression within this complex patient population to advance HF care delivery. center dot We seek to illustrate the patient, technical, and clinical workflow barriers that must be overcome to provide maximum clinical value and provide a framework to properly construct a digital phenotype that aims to risk stratify patients with HF and impact outcomes by leveraging the individualized monitoring and treatment strategies offered by these technologies.

AB  - Purpose Sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) is a prevalent sleep disorder in which apnea and hypopnea occur frequently during sleep and result in increase of the risk of lifestyle-related disease development as well as daytime sleepiness. Although SAS is a common sleep disorder, most patients remain undiagnosed because the gold standard test polysomnography (PSG), is high-cost and unavailable in many hospitals. Thus, an SAS screening system that can be used easily at home is needed.
   Methods Apnea during sleep affects changes in the autonomic nervous function, which causes fluctuation of the heart rate. In this study, we propose a new SAS screening method that combines heart rate measurement and long short-term memory (LSTM) which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). We analyzed the data of intervals between adjacent R waves (R-R interval; RRI) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) records, and used an LSTM model whose inputs are the RRI data is trained to discriminate the respiratory condition during sleep.
   Results The application of the proposed method to clinical data showed that it distinguished between patients with moderate-to-severe SAS with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100%, results which are superior to any other existing SAS screening methods.
   Conclusion Since the RRI data can be easily measured by means of wearable heart rate sensors, our method may prove to be useful as an SAS screening system at home.

AB  - Rationale:
   A sedentary lifestyle is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Smartwatches enable accurate daily activity monitoring for physical activity measurement and intervention. Few studies, however, have examined physical activity measures from smartwatches in relation to traditional risk factors associated with future risk for CVD.
   Objective:
   To investigate the association of habitual physical activity measured by smartwatch with predicted CVD risk in adults.
   Methods and Results:
   We enrolled consenting FHS (Framingham Heart Study) participants in an ongoing eFHS (electronic Framingham Heart Study) at the time of their FHS research center examination. We provided participants with a smartwatch (Apple Watch Series 0) and instructed them to wear it daily, which measured their habitual physical activity as the average daily step count. We estimated the 10-year predicted risk of CVD using the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2013 pooled cohort risk equation. We estimated the association between physical activity and predicted risk of CVD using linear mixed effects models adjusting for age, sex, wear time, and familial structure. Our study included 903 eFHS participants (mean age 53 +/- 9 years, 61% women, 9% non-White) who wore the smartwatch >= 5 hours per day for >= 30 days. Median daily step count was similar among men (7202 with interquartile range 3619) and women (7260 with interquartile range 3068; P=0.52). Average 10-year predicted CVD risk was 4.5% (interquartile range, 6.1%) for men and 1.2% (interquartile range, 2.2%) for women (P=1.3x10(-26)). Every 1000 steps higher habitual physical activity was associated with 0.18% lower predicted CVD risk (P=3.2x10(-4)). The association was attenuated but remained significant after further adjustment for body mass index (P=0.01).
   Conclusions:
   In this community-based sample of adults, higher daily physical activity measured by a study smartwatch was associated with lower predicted risk of CVD. Future research should examine the longitudinal association of prospectively measured daily activity and incident CVD.

AB  - In this article, a novel and an efficient methodology is presented for real-time monitoring of ECG signals. The method involves fast Fourier transform (FFT) based discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for extracting the features from the heartbeats which involves less computational complexity in terms of additions and multiplications operations for higher order filter lengths. These features extracted are recognized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) tuned twin support vector machines (TSVM) classifier. The TSVM classifier is four times faster than the standard SVM while the PSO technique is employed to gradually tune the classifier parameters to achieve more accuracy. The proposed methodology is implemented on IoT based microcontroller platform and validated on the benchmark Physionet data to classify 16 categories of ECG signals. Once an abnormality is detected, the platform generates a pop-up message as a warning and sends the information to a remote platform allowing hospitals to take preventive measures. The platform reported a higher overall accuracy of 95.68% than the existing studies. Further, such implementation can be utilized as a warning system in both homecare as well as tele-monitoring applications to continuously monitor the cardiac condition of a subject anywhere to the state-of-art heart disease diagnosis.

AB  - The main purpose of the present study was to assess the effects of foot drop stimulators (FDS) in individuals with stroke by means of spatio-temporal and step-to-step symmetry, harmonic ratio (HR), parameters obtained from trunk accelerations acquired using a wearable inertial sensor. Thirty-two patients (age: 56.84 +/- 9.10 years; 68.8% male) underwent an instrumental gait analysis, performed using a wearable inertial sensor before and a day after the 10-session treatment (PRE and POST sessions). The treatment consisted of 10 sessions of 20 min of walking on a treadmill while using the FDS device. The spatio-temporal parameters and the HR in the anteroposterior (AP), vertical (V), and mediolateral (ML) directions were computed from trunk acceleration data. The results showed that time had a significant effect on the spatio-temporal parameters; in particular, a significant increase in gait speed was detected. Regarding the HRs, the HR in the ML direction was found to have significantly increased (+20%), while those in the AP and V directions decreased (approximately 13%). Even if further studies are necessary, from these results, the HR seems to provide additional information on gait patterns with respect to the traditional spatio-temporal parameters, advancing the assessment of the effects of FDS devices in stroke patients.

AB  - ObjectiveWhile interest in the use of wearable large-volume injectors for subcutaneous drug delivery is increasing, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions these emerging dosing options are preferred over more frequent but shorter administration of smaller doses using handheld autoinjectors. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the characteristics of patients diagnosed with cancer, diabetes, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases, and treatment attributes that determine device preferences.MethodsBased on a cross-sectional online choice experiment, 191 participants expressed their preferences without being physically exposed to the devices or performing injections. Logistic hierarchical regression models were used to assess which patient characteristics, and how changes in treatment attributes, drive device preferences.ResultsParticipant quality of life reduced the likelihood of preferring wearable large-volume injectors to handheld autoinjectors. Moreover, reducing injection frequency from biweekly to monthly to quarterly injections, and shortening injection duration from 33 to 8 min, significantly increased the likelihood of patients preferring large-volume injectors to autoinjectors (p < 0.001).ConclusionThe study revealed patient quality of life as predictor of device preference and identified critical inflection points in injection duration and injection frequency, at which patient preferences shift from handheld autoinjectors to wearable large-volume injectors.

AB  - Objective: To improve measurement of upper extremity (UE) use in the community by evaluating the feasibility of using body-worn sensor data and machine learning models to distinguish productive prehensile and bimanual UE activity use from extraneous movements associated with walking.
   Design: Comparison of machine learning classification models with criterion standard of manually scored videos of performance in UE prosthesis users.
   Setting: Rehabilitation hospital training apartment.
   Participants: Convenience sample of UE prosthesis users (n=5) and controls (n =13) similar in age and hand dominance (N=18).
   Interventions: Participants were filmed executing a series of functional activities; a trained observer annotated each frame to indicate either UE movement directed at functional activity or walking. Synchronized data from an inertial sensor attached to the dominant wrist were similarly classified as indicating either a functional use or walking. These data were used to train 3 classification models to predict the functional versus walking state given the associated sensor information. Models were trained over 4 trials: on UE amputees and controls and both within subject and across subject. Model performance was also examined with and without preprocessing (centering) in the across-subject trials.
   Main Outcome Measure: Percent correct classification.
   Results: With the exception of the amputee/across-subject trial, at least 1 model classified >95% of test data correctly for all trial types. The top performer in the amputee/across-subject trial classified 85% of test examples correctly.
   Conclusions: We have demonstrated that computationally lightweight classification models can use inertial data collected from wrist-worn sensors to reliably distinguish prosthetic UE movements during functional use from walking-associated movement. This approach has promise in objectively measuring real-world UE use of prosthetic limbs and may be helpful in clinical trials and in measuring response to treatment of other UE pathologies.

AB  - There is a need to monitor patients with cancer of the head and neck postradiation therapy, as diminished swallowing activity can result in disuse atrophy and fibrosis of the swallowing muscles. This paper describes a flexible strain sensor comprising palladium nanoislands on single-layer graphene. These piezoresistive sensors were tested on 14 disease-free head and neck cancer patients with various levels of swallowing function: from nondysphagic to severely dysphagic. The patch-like devices detected differences in (1) the consistencies of food boluses when swallowed and (2) dysphagic and nondysphagic swallows. When surface electromyography (sEMG) is obtained simultaneously with strain data, it is also possible to differentiate swallowing vs nonswallowing events. The plots of resistance vs time are correlated to specific events recorded by video X-ray fluoroscopy. Finally, we developed a machine learning algorithm to automate the identification of bolus type being swallowed by a healthy subject (86.4%. accuracy). The algorithm was also able to discriminate between swallows of the same bolus from either the healthy subject or a dysphagic patient (94.7% accuracy). Taken together, these results may lead to noninvasive and home-based systems for monitoring of swallowing function and improved quality of life.

AB  - The etiology of cardiovascular disease is still an unsolved world problem, and high morbidity, disability, and mortality are the main characteristics of cardiovascular diseases. There is, therefore, a need for effective and rapid early prediction of likely outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a catalyst for enhancing the capabilities of AI applications. Data are collected through IoT sensors and analyzed and predicted using machine learning (ML). Existing traditional ML models do not handle data inequities well and have relatively low model prediction accuracy. To address this problem, considering the data observation mechanism and training methods of different algorithms, this paper proposes an ensemble framework based on stacking model fusion, from Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Extra Tree (ET), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) (10 classifiers to select the optimal base learners). In order to avoid the overfitting phenomenon generated by the base learners, we use the Logistic Regression (LR) simple linear classifier as the meta learner. We validated the proposed algorithm using a fused Heart Dataset from several UCI machine learning repositories and another publicly available Heart Attack Dataset, and compared it with 10 single classifier models. The experimental results show that the proposed stacking classifier outperforms other classifiers in terms of accuracy and applicability.

AB  - Personalised healthcare has seen significant improvements due to the introduction of health monitoring technologies that allow wearable devices to unintrusively monitor physiological parameters such as heart health, blood pressure, sleep patterns, and blood glucose levels, among others. Additionally, utilising advanced sensing technologies based on flexible and innovative biocompatible materials in wearable devices allows high accuracy and precision measurement of biological signals. Furthermore, applying real-time Machine Learning algorithms to highly accurate physiological parameters allows precise identification of unusual patterns in the data to provide health event predictions and warnings for timely intervention. However, in the predominantly adopted architectures, health event predictions based on Machine Learning are typically obtained by leveraging Cloud infrastructures characterised by shortcomings such as delayed response times and privacy issues. Fortunately, recent works highlight that a new paradigm based on Edge Computing technologies and on-device Artificial Intelligence significantly improve the latency and privacy issues. Applying this new paradigm to personalised healthcare architectures can significantly improve their efficiency and efficacy. Therefore, this paper reviews existing IoT healthcare architectures that utilise wearable devices and subsequently presents a scalable and modular system architecture to leverage emerging technologies to solve identified shortcomings. The defined architecture includes ultrathin, skin-compatible, flexible, high precision piezoelectric sensors, low-cost communication technologies, on-device intelligence, Edge Intelligence, and Edge Computing technologies. To provide development guidelines and define a consistent reference architecture for improved scalable wearable IoT-based critical healthcare architectures, this manuscript outlines the essential functional and non-functional requirements based on deductions from existing architectures and emerging technology trends. The presented system architecture can be applied to many scenarios, including ambient assisted living, where continuous surveillance and issuance of timely warnings can afford independence to the elderly and chronically ill. We conclude that the distribution and modularity of architecture layers, local AI-based elaboration, and data packaging consistency are the more essential functional requirements for critical healthcare application use cases. We also identify fast response time, utility, comfort, and low cost as the essential non-functional requirements for the defined system architecture.

AB  - Pressure coupled with shear stresses are the critical external factors for diabetic foot ulceration assessment and prevention. To date, a wearable system capable of measuring in-shoe multi-directional stresses for out-of-lab analysis has been elusive. The lack of an insole system capable of measuring plantar pressure and shear hinders the development of an effective foot ulcer prevention solution that could be potentially used in a daily living environment. This study reports the development of a first-of-its-kind sensorised insole system and its evaluation in laboratory settings and on human participants, indicating its potential as a wearable technology to be used in real-world applications. Laboratory evaluation revealed that the linearity error and accuracy error of the sensorised insole system were up to 3% and 5%, respectively. When evaluated on a healthy participant, change in footwear resulted in approximately 20%, 75% and 82% change in pressure, medial-lateral and anterior-posterior shear stress, respectively. When evaluated on diabetic participants, no notable difference in peak plantar pressure, as a result of wearing the sensorised insole, was measured. The preliminary results showed that the performance of the sensorised insole system is comparable to previously reported research devices. The system has adequate sensitivity to assist footwear assessment relevant to foot ulcer prevention and is safe to use for people with diabetes. The reported insole system presents the potential to help assess diabetic foot ulceration risk in a daily living environment underpinned by wearable pressure and shear sensing technologies.

AB  - As Internet of Things (IoT) networks expand globally with an annual increase of active devices, providing better safeguards to threats is becoming more prominent. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most viable solution that mitigates the threats of cyberattacks. Given the many constraints of the ever-changing network environment of IoT devices, an effective yet lightweight IDS is required to detect cyber anomalies and categorize various cyberattacks. Additionally, most publicly available datasets used for research do not reflect the recent network behaviors, nor are they made from IoT networks. To address these issues, in this paper, we have the following contributions: (1) we create a dataset from IoT networks, namely, the Center for Cyber Defense (CCD) IoT Network Intrusion Dataset V1 (CCD-INID-V1); (2) we propose a hybrid lightweight form of IDS-an embedded model (EM) for feature selection and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for attack detection and classification. The proposed method has two models: (a) RCNN: Random Forest (RF) is combined with CNN and (b) XCNN: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is combined with CNN. RF and XGBoost are the embedded models to reduce less impactful features. (3) We attempt anomaly (binary) classifications and attack-based (multiclass) classifications on CCD-INID-V1 and two other IoT datasets, the detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT dataset (Balot) and the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset (DoH20), to explore the effectiveness of these learning-based security models. Using RCNN, we achieved an Area under the Receiver Characteristic Operator (ROC) Curve (AUC) score of 0.956 with a runtime of 32.28 s on CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 71.46 s on Balot, and 0.986 with a runtime of 35.45 s on DoH20. Using XCNN, we achieved an AUC score of 0.998 with a runtime of 51.38 s for CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 72.12 s for Balot, and 0.999 with a runtime of 72.91 s for DoH20. Compared to KNN, XCNN required 86.98% less computational time, and RCNN required 91.74% less computational time to achieve equal or better accurate anomaly detections. We find XCNN and RCNN are consistently efficient and handle scalability well; in particular, 1000 times faster than KNN when dealing with a relatively larger dataset-Balot. Finally, we highlight RCNN and XCNN's ability to accurately detect anomalies with a significant reduction in computational time. This advantage grants flexibility for the IDS placement strategy. Our IDS can be placed at a central server as well as resource-constrained edge devices. Our lightweight IDS requires low train time and hence decreases reaction time to zero-day attacks.

AB  - Evaluating an illness's economic impact is critical for developing and executing appropriate policies. South Korea has mandatory national health insurance in the form of NHIS that provides propitious conditions for assessing the national financial burden of illnesses. The purpose of our study is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the economic impact of PM2.5 exposure in the subway and a comparative analysis of cause-specific mortality outcomes based on the prevalent health-risk assessment of the health effect endpoints (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and ischemic heart disease (IHD)). We used the National Health Insurance database to calculate the healthcare services provided to health-effect endpoints, with at least one primary diagnosis in 2019. Direct costs associated with health aid or medicine, treatment, and indirect costs (calculated based on the productivity loss in health effect endpoint patients, transportation, and caregivers, including morbidity and mortality costs) were both considered. The total cost for the exposed population for these endpoints was estimated to be USD 437 million per year. Medical costs were the largest component (22.08%), followed by loss of productivity and premature death (15.93%) and other costs such as transport and caregiver costs (11.46%). The total incurred costs (per 1000 persons) were accounted to be USD 0.1771 million, USD 0.42 million, and USD 0.8678 million for COPD, Asthma, and IHD, respectively. Given that the economic burden will rise as the prevalence of these diseases rises, it is vital to adopt effective preventative and management methods strategies aimed at the appropriate population.

AB  - Background. The Motoric Cognitive Risk (MCR) syndrome is defined in non-demented older adults by cognitive complaints and slow gait. Individuals with MCR are at higher risk of dementia and other poor clinical outcomes, such as falls. However, no data are available as regards functional mobility alterations associated with MCR. The main purpose of the present study is to quantitatively investigate such an aspect using the instrumented Timed-Up-and-Go (iTUG) test carried out using a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU).
   Methods. Fifty-one women aged over 65 years underwent a geriatric and neuropsychologic assessment (which included the Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE and Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination Revised, ACE-R), instrumented gait analysis and iTUG performed using an IMU located on the lower back. Based on subjective cognitive complaints and slow gait, they were assigned either to the MCR (n = 24) or non-MCR (n = 27) group. IMU data allowed calculation of overall and sub-phases iTUG times.
   Results. Women with MCR were characterized by a significantly higher body mass and body mass index, lower normalized handgrip strength, and similar values of MMSE compared to non-MCRs. A trend was observed in terms of lower overall and sub-domain ACE-R score. They also performed iTUG at a significantly slower speed (22.4 s vs 14.1 of the non-MCR group, p < 0.001) and exhibited increased sub-phase times (29 to 31% higher with respect to non-MCRs).
   Conclusions. The findings of the present study suggest that the MCR syndrome impairs functional mobility, probably due reduced muscular strength and coordination, fear of falling and increased instability. The instrumental evaluation of functional mobility appears useful in the management of women with MCR, particularly in monitoring the progression of the motor impairments, verifying the effectiveness of interventions targeted in alleviating the impact on daily life of mobility limitations associated with MCR and in defining tailored rehabilitation programs.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology that enables ubiquitous devices to connect with the Internet. IoT technology has revolutionized the medical and healthcare industry by interconnecting smart devices and sensors. IoT-based devices and biosensors are ideal to detect diabetes disease by collecting the accurate value of glucose continuously. Diabetes is one of the well-known and major chronic diseases that has a worldwide social impact on community life. Blood glucose monitoring is a challenging task, and there is a need to propose a proper architecture of the noninvasive glucose sensing and monitoring mechanism, which could make diabetic people aware of self-management techniques. This survey presents a rigorous discussion of diabetes types and presents detection techniques based on IoT technology. In this research, an IoT-based healthcare network infrastructure has been proposed for monitoring diabetes disease based on big data analytics, cloud computing, and machine learning. The proposed infrastructure could handle the symptoms of diabetes, collect data, analyze it, and then transmit the results to the server for the next action. Besides, presented an inclusive survey on IoT-based diabetes monitoring applications, services, and proposed solutions. Furthermore, based on IoT technology the diabetes disease management taxonomy has also been presented. Finally, presented the attacks taxonomy as well as discussed challenges, and proposed a lightweight security model in order to secure the patient's health data.

AB  - Among the many vital parameters of human body, breath rate monitoring is paramount to detect the symptoms of several respiratory diseases such as sleep apnea syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma. Hence, this paper puts forward a novel framework to measure the respiration rate (RR) using the reflective type photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals acquired using an inexpensive and easy-to-use wearable de -vice. Extracting the respiration induced amplitude variations (RIAV) from PPG signal using the incremental merge segmentation (IMS) algorithm, the proposed approach shows that robust RR estimation in realtime is feasible through low cost Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Using the sliding window approach augmented with adaptive thresholding technique that can deal with motion artifacts, we show that robust RR estimation is viable using reflectance type PPG, which is largely unexplored. Moreover, to handle the non-uniform nature of RIAV signal, this work employs uniform interval interpolation technique and removes the non-respiratory frequencies using finite impulse response (FIR) band-pass filter. Through the fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis of regular interval RIAV sequence, the dominant frequency corresponding to the RR is extracted. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated not only on two publicly available PPG datasets but also on a custom designed experimental setup integrated with the smartphone. The experimental results highlight that our approach can achieve a RR estimation accuracy of 1 bpm deviation against the ground truth.

AB  - Purpose Previous research has not examined the utility of the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) to predict physical activity (PA) change in cancer survivors. The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of a HAPA-based model in predicting temporal change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in cancer survivors. Methods Participants enrolled in the Wearable Activity Technology and Action Planning (WATAAP) trial completed validated questionnaires (n = 64) to assess HAPA constructs (action and maintenance self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, action planning, risk perceptions, and intention) and wore an ActiGraph to measure PA at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks later. Data were analyzed using variance-based structural equation modeling with residualized change scores for model variables. Results Consistent with predictions, changes in action self-efficacy (beta = 0.490, p < 0.001, ES = 0.258) and risk perceptions (beta = 0.312, p = 0.003, ES = 0.099) were statistically significant predictors of intention change over time. Changes in intention (beta = 0.217, p = 0.029, ES = 0.040) and action planning (beta = 0.234, p = 0.068, ES = 0.068) predicted changes in MVPA. Overall, the model accounted for significant variance in intention (R-2 = 0.380) and MVPA (R-2 = 0.228) change. Conclusions Changes in intention and action planning were important correlates of MVPA change over 24 weeks. Further, changes in action self-efficacy and risk perceptions predicted changes in intention. Implications for cancer survivors: interventions that foster risk perceptions and self-efficacy, strengthen intentions, and promote action planning may be effective in promoting sustained PA change in cancer survivors.

AB  - Objective: The objectives of this paper are to develop and test the ability of a wearable physiological sensors system, based on ECG, EDA, and EEG, to capture human stress and to assess whether the detected changes in physiological signals correlate with changes in salivary cortisol level, which is a reliable, objective biomarker of stress. Methods: 15 healthy participants, eight males and seven females, mean age 40.8 +/- 9.5 years, wore a set of three commercial sensors to record physiological signals during the Maastricht Acute Stress Test, an experimental protocol known to elicit robust physical and mental stress in humans. Salivary samples were collected throughout the different phases of the test. Statistical analysis was performed using a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm. A correlation analysis between extracted physiological features and salivary cortisol levels was also performed. Results: 15 features extracted from heart rate variability, electrodermal, and electroencephalography signals showed a high degree of significance in disentangling stress from a relaxed state. The classification algorithm, based on significant features, provided satisfactory outcomes with 86% accuracy. Furthermore, correlation analysis showed that the observed changes in physiological features were consistent with the trend of salivary cortisol levels (R-2 = 0.714). Conclusion: The tested set of wearable sensors was able to successfully capture human stress and quantify stress level. Significance: The results of this pilot study may be useful in designing portable and remote control systems, such as medical devices used to turn on interventions and prevent stress consequences.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may occur with old age and is associated with increased cognitive deterioration compared to what is normal. This may affect the person's quality of life, health, and independence. In this ageing worldwide context, early diagnosis and personalized assistance for MCI therefore become crucial. This paper makes two important contributions: (1) a system (RO-SmartAgeing) to address MCI, which was developed for Romania; and (2) a set of criteria for evaluating its impact on remote health monitoring. The system aims to provide customized non-invasive remote monitoring, health assessment, and assistance for the elderly within a smart environment set up in their homes. Moreover, it includes multivariate AI-based predictive models that can detect the onset of MCI and its development towards dementia. It was built iteratively, following literature reviews and consultations with health specialists, and it is currently being tested in a simulated home environment. While its main strength is the potential to detect MCI early and follow its evolution, RO-SmartAgeing also supports elderly people in living independently, and it is safe, comfortable, low cost, and privacy protected. Moreover, it can be used by healthcare institutions to continuously monitor a patient's vital signs, position, and activities, and to deliver reminders and alarms.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the feasibility of using a wireless wearable device (WD) in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) patients undergoing radionuclide therapy with I-131 (RAI) and protected hospitalization, this study compared the measurements of residual radioactivity obtained with those registered by a permanent environmental home device (HD). Methods: Twenty consecutive patients undergoing RAI hospitalized in restricted, controlled areas were enrolled. The patients underwent comprehensive monitoring of vital/nonvital parameters. We obtained 45580 similar to 13 measurements from the WD, detecting the residual radioactivity for each patient during approximately 56 hours of hospitalization, collecting data 53 times per hour. The samples, collected during daily activities, were averaged every two hours, and the results correlated with those from the HD. Bland-Altman analysis was also used to evaluate the agreement between the two techniques. Results: A significant relationship between theWDand HD was observed (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001). Bland-Altman analysis recognized the agreement between measurements by theWDand HD. The mean value at the end of the first day of hospitalization was 80.81 microSv/h and 60.77 microSv/h (p = ns for WD and HD), whereas those at the end of the second day were 47.08 and 24.96 (p = ns). In the generalized linear model (GLM), a similar trend in performance across time was found with the two techniques. Conclusion: This study demonstrates good agreement between the residual radioactivity measures estimated by the WD and HD modalities, rendering them interchangeable. This approach will allow both the optimization of medical staff exposure and safer patient discharge.

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), its communication and information enabling technologies are revolutionizing the production and services applications. In the healthcare domain, electronic health (eHealth) is evolving towards healthcare 4.0 through the Internet of things, big data analytics, Cloud and Fog computing technologies. There is need for early cancer detection, which can be achieved by new imaging technologies for example Terahertz imaging and Infrared thermography. The integration of such new imaging modalities and wearable sensor networks with computer aided diagnosis systems (CAD) and IoT systems with interconnectivity and interoperability could enable continuous, remote observation of cancer diagnosed patients by experts to monitor the success of treatment procedures, side effects of drugs, statistical analysis and making predictions of cancer based on age and demographics etc. for timely intervention and personalized care. In the healthcare 4.0 paradigm, there is need not only for smart diagnosis but also care through remote patient monitoring. The vital signs associated with cancer and clinical information can be integrated to make the system culminate into a smart system with health records. This work proposes an IoT enabled deep learning framework for classification of breast images; we propose the development of both custom CNN model and fine-tuned, pretrained CNN models capable of multimodal image classification. IoT simulation and cloud processing is performed in the ThingSpeak cloud platform with email alert capability. The performance of the CNN models has been evaluated using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics which achieved 98.44%, 98.44% and 98.45% respectively for the custom CNN model together with the receiver operating characteristics curves and confusion matrices.

AB  - Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that has multi-system involvement with co-occurring epilepsy, breathing problems and autonomic dysregulation. Autonomic dysregulation can increase the risk of cardiorespiratory vulnerability in this patient group. Assessment of heart rate variability (HRV) provides an overview of autonomic health in RTT and offers insight into how the sympathetic and parasympathetic components of the nervous system function. However, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated HRV in Rett patients to assess how the dynamics of autonomic function vary with age and changes during the day and/or night. Using non-invasive wearable sensors, we measured HRV in 45 patients with RTT and examined the time and frequency domain sympathetic and parasympathetic indices. Among the HRV indices assessed, heart rate decreases with age and is lower in the night across all ages studied. The sympathetic index (SDNN) and the parasympathetic indices (RMSSD and pNN50) are not seen to change with age. Nevertheless, these indices were all higher during the day when compared to the night. Our findings appear to show that Rett patients are less adaptable to autonomic changes during the night. In the clinical setting, this might be more relevant for patients with severe psychopathology.

AB  - Background: Thyrotoxicosis is a common disease caused by an excess of thyroid hormones. The prevalence of thyrotoxicosis about 2% and 70-90% of thyrotoxicosis cases are caused by Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease, which has a high recurrence rate when treated with antithyroid drugs such as methimazole or propylthiouracil. The clinical symptoms and signs of thyrotoxicosis include palpitation, weight loss, restlessness, and difficulty sleeping. Although these clinical changes in thyrotoxicosis can be detected by currently available wearable activity trackers, there have been few trials of the clinical application of wearable devices in patients with thyrotoxicosis.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the clinical applicability of wearable device-generated data to the management of thyrotoxicosis. We are analyzing continuously monitored data for heart rate, physical activity, and sleep in patients with thyrotoxicosis during their clinical course after treatment.
   Methods: Thirty thyrotoxic patients and 10 control subjects were enrolled in this study at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. Heart rate, physical activity, and sleep are being monitored using a Fitbit Charge HR or Fitbit Charge 2. Clinical data including anthropometric measures, thyroid function test, and hyperthyroidism symptom scale are recorded.
   Results: Study enrollment began in December 2016, and the intervention and follow-up phases are ongoing. The results of the data analysis are expected to be available by September 2017.
   Conclusions: This study will provide a foundational feasibility trial of the clinical applications of biosignal measurements to the differential diagnosis, prediction of clinical course, early detection of recurrence, and treatment in patients with thyrotoxicosis.

AB  - Early diagnosis can be crucial to limit both the mortality and economic burden of cardiovascular diseases. Recent developments have focused on the continuous monitoring of cardiac activity for a prompt diagnosis. Nowadays, wearable devices are gaining broad interest for a continuous monitoring of the heart rate (HR). One of the most promising methods to estimate HR is the seismocardiography (SCG) which allows to record the thoracic vibrations with high non-invasiveness in out-of-laboratory settings. Despite significant progress on SCG, the current state-of-the-art lacks both information on standardized sensor positioning and optimization of wearables design. Here, we introduce a soft wearable system (SWS), whose novel design, based on a soft polymer matrix embedding an array of fiber Bragg gratings, provides a good adhesion to the body and enables the simultaneous recording of SCG signals from multiple measuring sites. The feasibility assessment on healthy volunteers revealed that the SWS is a suitable wearable solution for HR monitoring and its performance in HR estimation is strongly influenced by sensor positioning and improved by a multi-sensor configuration. These promising characteristics open the possibility of using the SWS in monitoring patients with cardiac pathologies in clinical (e.g., during cardiac magnetic resonance procedures) and everyday life settings.

AB  - Heat-related illness is a growing concern for workers in temperate climates as rising temperatures and heatwaves put them at risk of exertional heat stroke. Monitoring biometrics that predict heat stroke, such as core temperature, is increasingly important. To monitor biometrics, wearable sensing technologies have been proposed as an alternative to the ingestible telemetric pill. However, limited studies have validated the accuracy of these sensors in different temperature conditions. Therefore, this study aims to assess the validity of wearable devices placed on different areas of the body for measuring core body temperature (CT) during repetitive physical activity in high temperature conditions. Ten male participants performed dumbbell curling exercises at 33 degrees C and roughly 50% relative humidity, and data from the pill (the criterion standard) were compared to data from two wearable sensors-Slate Safety and Zephyr. Results showed that Slate Safety [Bias (Precision) = 0.20 (0.35) degrees C) and Zephyr [Bias (Precision) = -0.03 (0.35) degrees C] recorded bias and precision within acceptable limits. The correlation analysis showed that wearable sensors are suitable for real-time monitoring of an individual's level of heat stress in high temperatures. However, there was a proportional bias with these CT measuring devices, meaning that the reported temperature values are consistently deviated from the true values. The results of this study contribute to the ongoing discussion of the most appropriate methods for monitoring heat stress and provide valuable information for practitioners working in this field.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of wearable sensors and low-cost mobile devices have prompted the development of systems for automated diagnosis. Here we focus on models and algorithms for the early detection of strokes that are implanted in a wearable device that generates warning alarms and automatically connects to e-health services, ensuring timely interventions at the onset of a stroke. The proposed approach employs two wearable devices to monitor movement data that involve two main stages: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and alarm generation. Two different HAR methods capable of classifying current human activity are developed and compared: one uses genetic fuzzy finite-state machines, and the other relies on Time Series (TS) analysis. Furthermore, an algorithm using Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) TS representation is proposed for alarm generation purposes, which is triggered by the detection of anomalous movements. The proposed methods are evaluated using realistic data gathered from healthy individuals. A discussion of topics related to the learning issues involved in these techniques is included. It is worth mentioning that the proposed algorithms can be easily transferred to embedded systems and can benefit from reduced learning costs.

AB  - Introduction: Agitation, experienced by patients with dementia, is difficult to manage and stressful for caregivers. Currently, agitation is primarily assessed by caregivers or clinicians based on self-report or very brief periods of observation. This limits availability of comprehensive or sensitive enough reporting to detect early signs of agitation or identify its precipitants. The purpose of this article is to provide proof of concept for characterizing and predicting agitation using a system that continuously monitors patients' activities and living environment within memory care facilities.
   Methods: Continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of a participant is achieved using behavioral sensors, which include passive infrared motion sensors, door contact sensors, a wearable actigraphy device, and a bed pressure mat sensor installed in the living quarters of the participant. Environmental sensors are also used to continuously assess temperature, light, sound, and humidity. Episodes of agitation are reported by nursing staff. Data collected for 138 days were divided by 8-hour nursing shifts. Features from agitated shifts were compared to those from non-agitated shifts using t-tests.
   Results: A total of 37 episodes of agitation were reported for a male participant, aged 64 with Alzheimer's disease, living in a memory care unit. Participant activity metrics (eg, transitions within the living room, sleep scores from the bedmat, and total activity counts from the actigraph) significantly correlated with occurrences of agitation at night (P <0.05). Environmental variables (eg, humidity) also correlated with the occurrences of agitation at night (P < 0.05). Higher activity levels were also observed in the evenings before agitated nights.
   Discussion: A platform of sensors used for unobtrusive and continuous monitoring of participants with dementia and their living space seems feasible and shows promise for characterization of episodes of agitation and identification of behavioral and environmental precipitants of agitation.

AB  - Wearable bendable bandage-based sensor and a minimally invasive microneedle biosensor are described toward rapid screening of skin melanoma. These wearable electrochemical sensors are capable of detecting the presence of the tyrosinase (TYR) enzyme cancer biomarker in the presence of its catechol substrate, immobilized on the transducer surface. In the presence of the surface TYR biomarker, the immobilized catechol is rapidly converted to benzoquinone that is detected amperometrically, with a current signal proportional to the TYR level. The flexible epidermal bandage sensor relies on printing stress-enduring inks which display good resiliency against mechanical deformations, whereas the hollow microneedle device is filled with catechol-coated carbon paste for assessing tissue TYR levels. The bandage sensor can thus be used directly on the skin whereas microneedle device can reach melanoma tissues under the skin. Both wearable sensors are interfaced to an ultralight flexible electronic board, which transmits data wirelessly to a mobile device. The analytical performance of the resulting bandage and microneedle sensing systems are evaluated using TYR-containing agarose phantom gel and porcine skin. The new integrated conformal portable sensing platforms hold considerable promise for decentralized melanoma screening, and can be extended to the screening of other key biomarkers in skin moles.

AB  - Diagnosis of arrhythmic disorders is challenging because of their short-lasting, intermittent character. Conventional technologies of noninvasive ambulatory rhythm monitoring are limited by modest sensitivity. We present a novel form of wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors providing an alternative tool for long-term rhythm monitoring with the potential of increased sensitivity to detect intermittent or subclinical arrhythmia. The objective was to assess the signal quality and R-R coverage of a wearable ECG sensor system compared to a standard 3-lead Holter. In this phase-1 trial, healthy individuals underwent 24-h simultaneous rhythm monitoring using the OMsignal system together with a 3-lead Holter recording. The OMsignal system consists of a garment (bra or shirt) with integrated sensors recording a single-lead ECG and an acquisition module for data storage and processing. Head-to-head signal quality was assessed regarding adequate P-QRS-T distinction and was performed by three electrophysiologists blinded to the recording technology. The accuracy of signal coverage was assessed using Bland-Altman analysis. Fifteen individuals underwent simultaneous 24-h recording. Signal quality and accuracy of the OMgaments was equivalent to Holter-monitoring (84% vs. 93% electrophysiologists rating, p = 0.06). Signal coverage of R-R intervals showed a very close overlay between the OMsignal system and Holter signals, mean difference in heart rate of 2 +/- 5 bpm. The noise level of OMgarments was comparable to Holter recording. OMgarments provide high signal quality for adequate rhythm analysis, representing a promising novel technology for long-term non-invasive ECG monitoring.

AB  - The recent developments in wearable devices and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allow real-time monitoring and recording of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, continuous monitoring of ECG signals is challenging in low-power wearable devices due to energy and memory constraints. Therefore, in this article, we present a novel and energy-efficient methodology for continuously monitoring the heart for low-power wearable devices. The proposed methodology is composed of three different layers: 1) a noise/artifact detection layer to grade the quality of the ECG signals; 2) a normal/abnormal beat classification layer to detect the anomalies in the ECG signals; and 3) an abnormal beat classification layer to detect diseases from ECG signals. Moreover, a distributed multioutput convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is used to decrease the energy consumption and latency between the edge-fog/cloud. Our methodology reaches an accuracy of 99.2% on the well-known MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Data Set. Evaluation on real hardware shows that our methodology is suitable for devices having a minimum RAM of 32 kb. Moreover, the proposed methodology achieves 7x more energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art works.

AB  - Background: Emerging digital health approaches could play a role in better personalized palliative care.Aim: We conducted a feasibility study testing wearable sensor (WS)-triggered ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and electronic patient-reported outcomes in community palliative care with patient-caregiver dyads.Design: All wore consumer-grade WS for five weeks. Sensor-detected "stress" (heart rate variability algorithm) that passed individualized thresholds triggered a short smartphone survey. Daily sleep surveys, weekly symptom surveys (Integrated Palliative care Outcome Scale), and a poststudy experience survey were conducted.Setting/Participants: Fifteen dyads (n = 30) were recruited from an outpatient palliative care clinic for people with cancer.Results: Daytime sensor wear-time had 73% adherence. Participants perceived value in this support. Quantity and severity of "stress" events were higher in patients. Sleep disturbance was similar but for different reasons: patients (physical symptoms) and caregivers (worrying about the patient).Conclusions: EMAs are feasible and valued in community palliative care.

AB  - Objective: Our goal is to measure real-world effects of at-risk driver physiology on safety-critical tasks like driving by monitoring driver behavior and physiology in real-time. Drivers with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an elevated crash risk that is linked to abnormal blood glucose, particularly hypoglycemia. We tested the hypotheses that (1) T1D drivers would have overall impaired vehicle control behavior relative to control drivers without diabetes, (2) At-risk patterns of vehicle control in T1D drivers would be linked to at-risk, in-vehicle physiology, and (3) T1D drivers would show impaired vehicle control with more recent hypoglycemia prior to driving. Methods: Drivers (18 T1D, 14 control) were monitored continuously (4 weeks) using in-vehicle sensors (e.g., video, accelerometer, speed) and wearable continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) that measured each T1D driver?s real-time blood glucose. Driver vehicle control was measured by vehicle acceleration variability (AV) across lateral (AV(Y), steering) and longitudinal (AV(X), braking/accelerating) axes in 45-second segments (N?=?61,635). Average vehicle speed for each segment was modeled as a covariate of AV and mixed-effects linear regression models were used. Results: We analyzed 3,687 drives (21,231 miles). T1D drivers had significantly higher overall AV(X, Y) compared to control drivers (B-X?=?2.5???10(?2) B-Y?=?1.6???10(?2), p?<?0.01)?which is linked to erratic steering or swerving and harsh braking/accelerating. At-risk vehicle control patterns were particularly associated with at-risk physiology, namely hypo- and hyperglycemia (higher overall AV(X,Y)). Impairments from hypoglycemia persisted for hours after hypoglycemia resolved, with drivers who had hypoglycemia within 2?3?h of driving showing higher AV(X) and AV(Y). State Department of Motor Vehicle records for the 3?years preceding the study showed that at-risk T1D drivers accounted for all crashes (N?=?3) and 85% of citations (N?=?13) observed. Conclusions: Our results show that T1D driver risk can be linked to real-time patterns of at-risk driver physiology, particularly hypoglycemia, and driver risk can be detected during and prior to driving. Such naturalistic studies monitoring driver vehicle controls can inform methods for early detection of hypoglycemia-related driving risks, fitness to drive assessments, thereby helping to preserve safety in at-risk drivers with diabetes.

AB  - AimThis paper presents the preliminary results from the ongoing REMOTE trial. It aims to explore the opportunities and hurdles of using insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) and photoplethysmography-based mobile health (PPG-based mHealth) using a smartphone or smartwatch to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in cryptogenic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. Methods and ResultsCryptogenic stroke or TIA patients (n = 39) received an ICM to search for AF and were asked to use a blinded PPG-based mHealth application for 6 months simultaneously. They were randomized to smartphone or smartwatch monitoring. In total, 68,748 1-min recordings were performed using PPG-based mHealth. The number of mHealth recordings decreased significantly over time in both smartphone and smartwatch groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Insufficient signal quality was more frequently observed in smartwatch (43.3%) compared to smartphone recordings (17.8%, p < 0.001). However, when looking at the labeling of the mHealth recordings on a patient level, there was no significant difference in signal quality between both groups. Moreover, the use of a smartwatch resulted in significantly more 12-h periods (91.4%) that were clinically useful compared to smartphone users (84.8%) as they had at least one recording of sufficient signal quality. Simultaneously, continuous data was collected from the ICMs, resulting in approximately 6,660,000 min of data (i.e., almost a 100-fold increase compared to mHealth). The ICM algorithm detected AF and other cardiac arrhythmias in 10 and 19 patients, respectively. However, these were only confirmed after adjudication by the remote monitoring team in 1 (10%) and 5 (26.3%) patients, respectively. The confirmed AF was also detected by PPG-based mHealth. ConclusionBased on the preliminary observations, our paper illustrates the potential as well as the limitations of PPG-based mHealth and ICMs to detect AF in cryptogenic stroke and TIA patients in four elements: (i) mHealth was able to detect AF in a patient in which AF was confirmed on the ICM; (ii) Even state-of-the-art ICMs yielded many false-positive AF registrations; (iii) Both mHealth and ICM still require physician revision; and (iv) Blinding of the mHealth results impairs compliance and motivation.

AB  - Stroke or cerebrovascular accidents are among the three leading causes of death worldwide. Furthermore, strokes are a major cause of morbidity, hospitalizations, and acquired disabilities. Stroke diagnoses are usually made based on the set of symptoms exhibited and, more specifically, on the results of neuroimaging exams. Among the different types of neuroimaging, computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used because it can show the extent and severity of the accident. Furthermore, CT exams are faster, more accessible than other systems, and are financially viable. Thus, due to its emergency nature, CAD systems that can analyze CT images are essential to obtain information that can accelerate the diagnosis and definition of appropriate treatment. This work presents a new feature extractor from CT images of the brain to assist in the detection and classification of strokes, called Parzen Analysis of Brain Tissue Densities. The proposed method can reduce the subjectivity present in the brain tissue bands using Parzen Window Estimation by calculating the probability that each pixel belongs to a preconfigured range. In addition, the method is fully integrated with an Internet of Things framework and can be used remotely to assist medical specialists in the diagnosis and treatment of strokes. The method presented promising results, reaching the highest values of accuracy, 98.41%, F1-Score, 97.61%, negative predictive value, 98.80%, and positive predictive value, 95.45%, among all the methods evaluated here. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in extracting relevant features from brain CTs to describe if there is a stroke as well as determining its type. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BackgroundThe WEARIT-II Registry demonstrated efficacy and safety of the wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) for at-risk cardiac patients. However, 1-year outcomes in this population have not been reported.
   MethodsThe WEARIT-II Registry enrolled 2,000 U.S. patients prescribed the WCD. One-year mortality data from start of WCD use were prospectively collected for 1,846 patients (93%). Outcome data were analyzed by disease etiology and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation following WCD use.
   ResultsDuring 12 months of follow-up, 73 patients died (4%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed differences in all-cause mortality from WCD prescription between patients with ischemic versus nonischemic cardiomyopathy versus congenital/inherited heart disease (4%vs 3%vs 7%, P=0.013). Patients with ventricular arrhythmia events during WCD use had a higher 1-year mortality (10%vs 3%, P=0.042). Renal disease, increasing age, prior syncope, and nonbeta-blocker use predicted mortality. One-year mortality was similar in patients who did versus did not receive an ICD following WCD use in ischemic (3%vs 4%, P=0.470) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy (3%vs 3%, P=0.892). Patients with congenital/inherited heart disease with no implanted ICD had a trend toward a higher rate of mortality than those who received an ICD (8%vs 3%, P=0.082). Multivariate models confirmed these findings.
   ConclusionOne-year follow-up from the WEARIT-II Registry shows an overall good survival in patients prescribed the WCD. Short-term use of WCD allows appropriate risk stratification for decision on an ICD implantation in at-risk ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy patients. Congenital/inherited heart disease patients had a higher risk of 1-year mortality even without an implanted ICD post-WCD.

AB  - Objective: Current rating scales for Tourette syndrome (TS) are limited by recollection bias or brief assessment periods. This proof-of-concept study aimed to develop a sensor-based paradigm to detect and classify tics. Methods: We recorded both electromyogram and acceleration data from seventeen TS patients, either when voluntarily moving or experiencing tics and during the modified Rush Video Tic Rating Scale (mRVTRS). Spectral properties of voluntary and tic movements from the sensor that captured the dominant tic were calculated and used as features in a support vector machine (SVM) to detect and classify movements retrospectively. Results: Across patients, the SVM had an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.69 +/- 4.84%, 98.24 +/- 4. 79%, and 96.03 +/- 6.04%, respectively, when classifying movements in the test dataset. Furthermore, each patient's SVM was validated using data collected during the mRVTRS. Compared to the expert consensus, the tic detection accuracy was 85.63 +/- 15.28% during the mRVTRS, while overall movement classification accuracy was 94.23 +/- 5.97%. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that wearable sensors can capture physiological differences between tic and voluntary movements and are comparable to expert consensus. Significance: Ultimately, wearables could individualize and improve care for people with TS, provide a robust and objective measure of tics, and allow data collection in real-world settings.

AB  - Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.

AB  - Background Wearable Cardioverter Defibrillators (WCD) have been effectively used for more than a decade in North America and Europe for prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular arrhythmias. This device has only recently been available in Australia.
   Method At Westmead hospital, WCD has been used since 2013 as a bridging therapy to an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for those at high risk, but are temporarily not suitable for an implantable device. Indications for use were explanted infected ICD, dilated cardiomyopathy, post partum cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease and myocarditis. The default device settings were: ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold of 150 bpm and 200 bpm respectively and response times were 60 secs for VT and 25 secs for VF.
   Outcome WCD was used in eight patients. Duration of use ranged from five to 180 days with median of 77 days. Daily usage averaged 23.4 +/- 0.6 hours. All except one were compliant with the device and none of our patients received shock or died during device usage. Four of the eight patients received ICD, two declined ICD, one was judged to no longer require ICD and one remains under assessment.
   Conclusion WCD is easy to use, well tolerated and is effective for SCD prevention in patients who are temporarily not suitable for ICD. However patients need to be actively followed-up to reduce the duration of WCD usage and thereby be cost effective.

AB  - Regardless of age, it is always important to detect deviations in long-term blood pressure from normal levels. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure throughout the day is even more important for elderly people with cardiovascular diseases or a high risk of stroke. The traditional cuff-based method for blood pressure measurements is not suitable for continuous real-time applications and is very uncomfortable. To address this problem, continuous blood pressure measurement methods based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) have been developed. However, these methods use specialized high-performance hardware and sensors, which are not available for common users. This paper proposes the continuous systolic blood pressure (SBP) estimation method based on PPG pulse wave steepness for low processing power wearable devices and evaluates its suitability using the commercially available CMS50FW Pulse Oximeter. The SBP estimation is done based on the PPG pulse wave steepness (rising edge angle) because it is highly correlated with systolic blood pressure. The SBP estimation based on this single feature allows us to significantly reduce the amount of data processed and avoid errors, due to PPG pulse wave amplitude changes resulting from physiological or external factors. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed SBP estimation method allows the use of off-the-shelf wearable PPG measurement devices with a low sampling rate (up to 60 Hz) and low resolution (up to 8-bit) for precise SBP measurements (mean difference MD = -0.043 and standard deviation SD = 6.79). In contrast, the known methods for continuous SBP estimation are based on equipment with a much higher sampling rate and better resolution characteristics.

AB  - Background: Wearable sensors have been increasingly used in behavioral research for real-time assessment and intervention purposes. The rapid advancement of biomedical technology typically used in clinical settings has made wearable sensors more accessible to a wider population. Yet the acceptability of this technology for nonclinical purposes has not been examined.
   Objective: The aim was to assess the acceptability of wearing a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) device among a sample of nondiabetic individuals, and to compare the acceptability of a CGM between a mobile diet tracking app (MyFitnessPal) and an accelerometer.
   Methods: A total of 30 nondiabetic adults went through a 7-day observational study. They wore a CGM sensor, tracked their diet and physical activity using the CGM receiver and MyFitnessPal, and wore an accelerometer on their waist. After the monitoring period, they completed a 10-item survey regarding acceptability of each of the study tools. Two-tailed paired-sample t tests were conducted to examine whether the summary acceptability scores were comparable between the CGM sensor/receiver and MyFitnessPal/accelerometer.
   Results: More than 90% of the study participants agreed that the CGM sensor and receiver were easy to use (28/30 and 27/30, respectively), useful (28/30 and 29/30, respectively), and provided relevant information that was of interest to them (27/30 and 28/30, respectively). The summary acceptability scores (out of a 5-point Likert scale) were mean 4.06 (SD 0.55) for the CGM sensor, mean 4.05 (SD 0.58) for the CGM receiver, mean 4.10 (SD 0.68) for MyFitnessPal, and mean 3.73 (SD 0.76) for the accelerometer.
   Conclusions: The high acceptability of using a CGM from this study suggests a great potential for using CGMs in nondiabetic adults in research settings. Although potential selection bias might contribute to the high acceptability in this study, the continued advancements in wearable sensor technology will make the barriers to tracking and collecting personal physiological data more and more minimal.

AB  - Microfluidic paper-based devices (mu PADs) and wearable devices have been highly studied to be used as diagnostic tools due to their advantages such as simplicity and ability to provide instrument-free fast results. Diseases such as periodontitis and diabetes mellitus can potentially be detected through these devices by the detection of important biomarkers. This study describes the development of mu PADs through craft cutter printing for glucose and nitrite salivary diagnostics. In addition, the use of mu PADs integrated into a mouthguard as a wearable sensor for glucose monitoring is also presented. mu PADs were designed to contain two detection zones for glucose and nitrite assays and a sampling zone interconnected by microfluidic channels. Initially, the analytical performance of the proposed mu PADs was investigated and it provided linear behavior (r(2)>= 0.994) in the concentration ranges between 0 to 2.0mmolL(-1) and 0 to 400 mu molL(-1) for glucose and nitrite, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection achieved for glucose and nitrite were 27 mu molL(-1) and 7 mu molL(-1), respectively. Human saliva samples were collected from healthy individuals and patients previously diagnosed with periodontitis or diabetes and then analyzed on the proposed mu PADs. The results found using mu PADs revealed higher glucose concentration values in saliva collected from patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and greater nitrite concentrations in saliva collected from patients diagnosed with periodontitis, as expected. The results obtained on mu PADs did not differ statistically from those measured by spectrophotometry. With the aim of developing paper-based wearable sensors, mu PADs were integrated, for the first time, into a silicone mouthguard using a 3D-printed holder. The proof of concept was successfully demonstrated through the monitoring of the glucose concentration in saliva after the ingestion of chocolate. According to the results reported herein, paper-based microfluidic devices offer great potential for salivary diagnostics, making their integration into a silicone mouthguard possible, generating simple, low-cost, instrument-free, and powerful wearable sensors.

AB  - Pulmonary cancer is considered as one of the major causes of death worldwide. For the detection of lung cancer, computer-assisted diagnosis (CADx) systems have been designed. Internet-of-Things (IoT) has enabled ubiquitous interne access to biomedical datasets and techniques; in result, the progress in CADx is significant. Unlike the conventional CADx, deep learning techniques have the basic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature as they have the ability to learn mid and high level image representations. We proposed a Computer-Assisted Decision Support System in Pulmonary Cancer by using the novel deep learning based model and metastasis information obtained from MBAN (Medical Body Area Network). The proposed model, DFCNet, is based on the deep fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) which is used for classification of each detected pulmonary nodule into four lung cancer stages. The performance of proposed work is evaluated on different datasets with varying scan conditions. Comparison of proposed classifier is done with the existing CNN techniques. Overall accuracy of CNN and DFCNet was 77.6% and 84.58%, respectively. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method for the detection and classification of lung cancer nodules. These results demonstrate the potential for the proposed technique in helping the radiologists in improving nodule detection accuracy with efficiency.

AB  - Purpose: Ultrasound scanning has been widely used for preliminary diagnosis as it is non-invasive and has good scope for the doctors to analyze many diseases. Due to lack of trained radiologists in remote areas, tele-radiology is used to diagnose the scanned ultrasound data. Availability of online radiographers and having communication facility for the portable ultrasound are issues in tele-radiology for using ultrasound scanning in remote health-care. In these situations, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) will be beneficial in diagnosing the patients with minimal manual intervention.
   Methods: We proposed FPGA based CAD algorithm for abnormality detection of kidney in ultrasound images. The proposed algorithm works in the following way: as a pre-processing, an ultrasound image is denoised and region of interest of kidney in ultrasound image is segmented. Intensity histogram features and Haralick features are extracted from the segmented kidney region. Based on extracted features, the classification algorithm is implemented in two stages. In first stage, a Look Up Table (LUT) based approach is used to differentiate between normal and abnormal kidney images. In second stage, after confirming the abnormality, Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier trained with extracted features is used to further classify the presence of stone or cyst in kidney. The proposed algorithm is implemented on a FPGA based Xilinx Kintex-7 board.
   Results: The proposed algorithm gave an accuracy of 98.14%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96.82% in detecting the exact abnormality present in kidney ultrasound images.
   Conclusion: the proposed algorithm and its hardware implementation will be beneficial for diagnosing the kidney in absence of radiologists and internet connectivity. (C) 2016 AGBM. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work proposes a new intelligent disease prediction system for predicting the disease and also knowing the current status of the dead diseases such as diabetic, heart and cancer diseases. More number of people are affecting and losing their life early due to these diseases so that these are also called as dead diseases. The proposed disease prediction and monitoring system consists of two phases such as feature selection and classification phases. In the feature selection phase, a newly proposed feature selection algorithm called conditional random field and mutual information-based feature selection algorithm is used for identifying the most contributed features that are used to enhance the prediction accuracy. In the classification phase, a newly proposed fuzzy-aware multilayer backpropagation neural network is applied for predicting and monitoring the diabetic disease and heart disease effectively. Here, newly generated fuzzy rules are also incorporated for making effective decision on patient records. The proposed prediction and monitoring system is used to predict and monitor the heart, diabetic and cancer diseases. The experiments have been conducted for evaluating the performance of the proposed disease prediction and monitoring system by using UCI Machine Learning Repository datasets and also proved that as better than the existing disease prediction systems in terms of precision, recall, F-measure and prediction accuracy.

AB  - Diabetes is a chronic endocrine disease that occurs due to an imbalance in glucose levels and altering carbohydrate metabolism. It is a leading cause of morbidity, resulting in a reduced quality of life even in developed societies, primarily affected by a sedentary lifestyle and often leading to mortality. Keeping track of blood glucose levels noninvasively has been made possible due to diverse breakthroughs in wearable sensor technology coupled with holistic digital healthcare. Efficient glucose management has been revolutionized by the development of continuous glucose monitoring sensors and wearable, non/minimally invasive devices that measure glucose concentration by exploiting different physical principles, e.g., glucose oxidase, fluorescence, or skin dielectric properties, and provide real-time measurements every 1-5 min. This paper presents a highly novel and completely non-invasive sweat sensor platform technology that can measure and report glucose concentrations from passively expressed human eccrine sweat using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and affinity capture probe functionalized sensor surfaces. The sensor samples 1-5 mu L of sweat from the wearer every 1-5 min and reports sweat glucose from a machine learning algorithm that samples the analytical reference values from the electrochemical sweat sensor. These values are then converted to continuous time-varying signals using the interpolation methodology. Supervised machine learning, the decision tree regression algorithm, shows the goodness of fit R-2 of 0.94 was achieved with an RMSE value of 0.1 mg/dL. The output of the model was tested on three human subject datasets. The results were able to capture the glucose progression trend correctly. Sweet sensor platform technology demonstrates a dynamic response over the physiological sweat glucose range of 1-4 mg/dL measured from 3 human subjects. The technology described in the manuscript shows promise for real-time biomarkers such as glucose reporting from passively expressed human eccrine sweat.

AB  - Neonatal period represents first 28 days of life, which is the most vulnerable time for a child's survival especially for the preterm babies. High neonatal mortality is a prominent and persistent problem across the globe. Non-availability of trained staff and infrastructure are the major recognized hurdles in the quality care of these neonates. Hourly progress growth charts and reports are still maintained manually by nurses along with continuous calculation of drug dosage and nutrition as per the changing weight of the baby. iNICU (integrated Neonatology Intensive Care Unit) leverages Beaglebone and Intel Edison based IoT integration with biomedical devices in NICU i.e. monitor, ventilator and blood gas machine. iNICU is hosted on IBM Softlayer based cloud computing infrastructure and map NICU workflow in Java based responsive web application to provide translational research informatics support to the clinicians. iNICU captures real time vital parameters i.e. respiration rate, heart rate, lab data and PACS amounting for millions of data points per day per child. Stream of data is sent to Apache Kafka layer which stores the same in Apache Cassandra NoSQL. iNICU also captures clinical data like feed intake, urine output, and daily assessment of child in PostgreSQL database. It acts as first Big Data hub (of both structured and unstructured data) of neonates across India offering temporal (longitudinal) data of their stay in NICU and allow clinicians in evaluating efficacy of their interventions. iNICU leverages drools based clinical rule based engine and deep learning based big data analytical model coded in R and PMML. iNICU solution aims to improve care time, fills skill gap, enable remote monitoring of neonates in rural regions, assists in identifying the early onset of disease, and reduction in neonatal mortality.

AB  - Performing regular physical activity positively affects individuals' quality of life in both the short- and long-term and also contributes to the prevention of chronic diseases. However, exerted effort is subjectively perceived from different individuals. Therefore, this work explores an out-of-laboratory approach using a wrist-worn device to classify the perceived intensity of physical effort based on quantitative measured data. First, the exerted intensity is classified by two machine learning algorithms, namely the Support Vector Machine and the Bagged Tree, fed with features computed on heart-related parameters, skin temperature, and wrist acceleration. Then, the outcomes of the classification are exploited to validate the use of the Electrodermal Activity signal alone to rate the perceived effort. The results show that the Support Vector Machine algorithm applied on physiological and acceleration data effectively predicted the relative physical activity intensities, while the Bagged Tree performed best when the Electrodermal Activity data were the only data used.

AB  - To date, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have proved to play a key role in many medical applications, for example, the rehabilitation of stroke patients. For post-stroke rehabilitation, the BCIs require the EEG electrodes to precisely translate the brain signals of patients into intended movements of the paralyzed limb for months. However, the gold standard silver/silver-chloride electrodes cannot satisfy the requirements for long-term sta-bility and preparation-free recording capability in wearable EEG devices, thus limiting the versatility of EEG in wearable BCI applications over time outside the rehabilitation center. Here, we design a long-term stable and low electrode-skin interfacial impedance conductive polymer-hydrogel EEG electrode that maintains a lower impedance value than gel-based electrodes for 29 days. With this technology, EEG-based long-term and wearable BCIs could be realized in the near future. To demonstrate this, our designed electrode is applied for a wireless single-channel EEG device that detects changes in alpha rhythms in eye-open/eye-close conditions. In addition, we validate that the designed electrodes could capture oscillatory rhythms in motor imagery protocols as well as low-frequency time-locked event-related potentials from healthy subjects, with similar or better performance than gel-based electrodes. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the designed electrode in online BCI-based func-tional electrical stimulation, which could be used for post-stroke rehabilitation.

AB  - In medical imaging applications, the accurate diagnosis of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at an early stage is a challenging task to researchers nowadays. The early detection of the tumor reduces the mortality rate from brain cancer-related deaths. Among various medical imaging techniques, the MRI is utilized due to low ionization and radiation, but manual inspection takes a lot of time. This proposed work introduces a machine learning technique (MLT) to recognize and classify the tumorous or non-tumorous regions based on the brain MRI dataset. There are four steps to carry out the MLT such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification procedures. In the first stage, the skull is removed manually to reduce the time complexity by avoiding the process of the unwanted area of the brain image, and median filtering is utilized to filter the noise factor. Next, Chan-Vese (C-V) technique is used to segment the active tumor by selecting the exact initial point. In the very next step, the features of the tumor area are extracted using the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and then important statistical features were chosen. Finally, a two-class classifier is implemented using the support vector machine (SVM) and its performance is then validated with k nearest neighbor (KNN). The accomplishment of the proposed flow work was evaluated in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision by performing on the BRATS 2017 benchmark dataset. The simulation results reveal that the proposed system outer performs over existing methods with high accuracy.

AB  - Stroke patients are monitored hourly by physicians and nurses in an attempt to better understand their physical state. To quantify the patients' level of mobility, hourly movement (i.e. motor) assessment scores are performed, which can be taxing and time-consuming for nurses and physicians. In this paper, we attempt to find a correlation between patient motor scores and continuous accelerometer data recorded in subjects who are unilaterally impaired due to stroke. The accelerometers were placed on both upper and lower extremities of four severely unilaterally impaired patients and their movements were recorded continuously for 7 to 14 days. Features that incorporate movement smoothness, strength, and characteristic movement patterns were extracted from the accelerometers using time-frequency analysis. Support vector classifiers were trained with the extracted features to test the ability of the long term accelerometer recordings in predicting dependent and antigravity sides, and significantly above baseline performance was obtained in most instances (P < 0.05). Finally, a leave-one-subject-out approach was carried out to assess the generalizability of the proposed methodology, and above baseline performance was obtained in two out of the three tested subjects. The methodology presented in this paper provides a simple, yet effective approach to perform long term motor assessment in neurocritical care patients.

AB  - Lung cancer is a high-risk disease that causes mortality worldwide; nevertheless, lung nodules are the main manifestation that can help to diagnose lung cancer at an early stage, lowering the workload of radiologists and boosting the rate of diagnosis. Artificial intelligence-based neural networks are promising technologies for automatically detecting lung nodules employing patient monitoring data acquired from sensor technology through an Internet-of-Things (IoT)-based patient monitoring system. However, the standard neural networks rely on manually acquired features, which reduces the effectiveness of detection. In this paper, we provide a novel IoT-enabled healthcare monitoring platform and an improved grey-wolf optimization (IGWO)-based deep convulution neural network (DCNN) model for lung cancer detection. The Tasmanian Devil Optimization (TDO) algorithm is utilized to select the most pertinent features for diagnosing lung nodules, and the convergence rate of the standard grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is modified, resulting in an improved GWO algorithm. Consequently, an IGWO-based DCNN is trained on the optimal features obtained from the IoT platform, and the findings are saved in the cloud for the doctor's judgment. The model is built on an Android platform with DCNN-enabled Python libraries, and the findings are evaluated against cutting-edge lung cancer detection models.

AB  - Recent advances in wearable sensor technology and machine learning (ML) have allowed for the seamless and objective study of human motion in clinical applications, including Parkinson's disease, and stroke. Using ML to identify salient patterns in sensor data has the potential for widespread application in neurological disorders, so understanding how to develop this approach for one's area of inquiry is vital. We previously proposed an approach that combined wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) and ML to classify motions made by stroke patients. However, our approach had computational and practical limitations. We address these limitations here in the form of a primer, presenting how to optimize a sensor-ML approach for clinical implementation. First, we demonstrate how to identify the ML algorithm that maximizes classification performance and pragmatic implementation. Second, we demonstrate how to identify the motion capture approach that maximizes classification performance but reduces cost. We used previously collected motion data from chronic stroke patients wearing off-the-shelf IMUs during a rehabilitation-like activity. To identify the optimal ML algorithm, we compared the classification performance, computational complexity, and tuning requirements of four off-the-shelf algorithms. To identify the optimal motion capture approach, we compared the classification performance of various sensor configurations (number and location on the body) and sensor type (IMUs vs. accelerometers). Of the algorithms tested, linear discriminant analysis had the highest classification performance, low computational complexity, and modest tuning requirements. Of the sensor configurations tested, seven sensors on the paretic arm and trunk led to the highest classification performance, and IMUs outperformed accelerometers. Overall, we present a refined sensor-ML approach that maximizes both classification performance and pragmatic implementation. In addition, with this primer, we showcase important considerations for appraising off-the-shelf algorithms and sensors for quantitative motion assessment.

AB  - Based on the advantages of Internet of things, this paper focuses on the research of intelligent recommendation model for cancer patients' rehabilitation, and designs a user-friendly intelligent recommendation system of cancer rehabilitation scheme. In view of the uncertainty of the cause and time of recurrence of cancer patients, the convolutional neural network algorithm was used to predict both of them. The prediction results of the model showed that the prediction accuracy was high, reaching 92%. To solve the problem of the optimal nutrition program for the rehabilitation of cancer patients, we took the recurrence time as the objective function, and established the recommendation model of the optimal nutrition support program for the rehabilitation by using BAS algorithm. Finally, under the framework of Internet of things technology, the intelligent recommendation model of cancer rehabilitation prediction model and nutrition support program was integrated to realize the recommendation system of intelligent recommendation of rehabilitation nutrition support program for cancer rehabilitation patients according to their different characteristics. After the system simulation experiment, it was found that under the condition that the predicted recurrence location was almost unchanged (49% of simulation results and 50% of actual results), the nutritional support scheme recommended by the intelligent recommendation system could extend the postoperative recurrence time of patients by more than 95%.

AB  - Background: Cancer treatments can cause a variety of symptoms that impair quality of life and functioning but are frequently missed by clinicians. Smartphone and wearable sensors may capture behavioral and physiological changes indicative of symptom burden, enabling passive and remote real-time monitoring of fluctuating symptoms
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether smartphone and Fitbit data could be used to estimate daily symptom burden before and after pancreatic surgery.
   Methods: A total of 44 patients scheduled for pancreatic surgery participated in this prospective longitudinal study and provided sufficient sensor and self-reported symptom data for analyses. Participants collected smartphone sensor and Fitbit data and completed daily symptom ratings starting at least two weeks before surgery, throughout their inpatient recovery, and for up to 60 days after postoperative discharge. Day-level behavioral features reflecting mobility and activity patterns, sleep, screen time, heart rate, and communication were extracted from raw smartphone and Fitbit data and used to classify the next day as high or low symptom burden, adjusted for each individual's typical level of reported symptoms. In addition to the overall symptom burden, we examined pain, fatigue, and diarrhea specifically.
   Results: Models using light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were able to correctly predict whether the next day would be a high symptom day with 73.5% accuracy, surpassing baseline models. The most important sensor features for discriminating high symptom days were related to physical activity bouts, sleep, heart rate, and location. LightGBM models predicting next-day diarrhea (79.0% accuracy), fatigue (75.8% accuracy), and pain (79.6% accuracy) performed similarly.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that digital biomarkers may be useful in predicting patient-reported symptom burden before and after cancer surgery. Although model performance in this small sample may not be adequate for clinical implementation, findings support the feasibility of collecting mobile sensor data from older patients who are acutely ill as well as the potential clinical value of mobile sensing for passive monitoring of patients with cancer and suggest that data from devices that many patients already own and use may be useful in detecting worsening perioperative symptoms and triggering just-in-time symptom management interventions.

AB  - The recently evolving remote healthcare technology could potentially aid the realization of cost-effective and lasting solutions to life-threatening diseases such as heart failure. Such a remote healthcare system should integrate an effectual heart failure risk monitoring and prediction platform. However, developing a heart failure risk (HFR) prediction method that objectively incorporate individual contributive characteristics of HFR risk factors, that are required for adequate prediction remains a challenge. Towards addressing this research gap, a new approach driven by hierarchical neighborhood component-based-learning (HNCL) and adaptive multi-layer networks (AMLN) is proposed. In the proposed method, the HNCL module firstly learns the interrelations among the HFR attributes/risk factors to construct a set of informative features, regarded as the global weight vector that reflects individual contribution of each risk factor. Subsequently, the constructed global weight vector is applied in building an AMLN model for the prediction of HFR. Moreover, the proposed method's performances were extensively validated with a benchmark clinical database of potential heart failure patients and compared with previous studies using prediction accuracies, performance plots, receiving operating characteristic analysis, error-histogram analysis, specificity, and sensitivity metrics. From the experimental results, we found that the proposed method (AMLN-HNCL) achieved significantly higher and stable predictions with an improvement of approximately 11.10% over the commonly applied method. Additionally, the proposed method recorded 9.09% and 12.48% improvements for specificity and sensitivity, respectively compared to the commonly applied method. The superiority in performances achieved by the proposed method should be because the interrelations amongst the risk factors were adequately learnt and their individual contribution was objectively accounted for in the prediction task. Thus, we believe that the proposed method could potentially facilitate the practical implementation of accurately robust HFR prediction module in the context of the currently emerging remote healthcare system, especially in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems. Also, the method may be applied in wearable mobile health-care gadgets capable of monitoring the heart failure status in individuals. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Early detection of atrial fibrillation or Flutter (AF) may enable prevention of downstream morbidity. Consumer wrist-worn wearable technology is capable of detecting AF by identifying irregular pulse waveforms using photoplethysmography (PPG). The validity of PPG-based software algorithms for AF detection requires prospective assessment. Methods The Fitbit Heart Study (NCT04380415) is a single-arm remote clinical trial examining the validity of a novel PPG-based software algorithm for detecting AF. The proprietary Fitbit algorithm examines pulse waveform intervals during analyzable periods in which participants are sufficiently stationary. Fitbit consumers with compatible wrist-worn trackers or smartwatches were invited to participate. Enrollment began May 6, 2020 and as of October 1, 2020, 455,699 participants enrolled. Participants in whom an irregular heart rhythm was detected were invited to attend a telehealth visit and eligible participants were then mailed a one-week single lead electrocardiographic (ECG) patch monitor. The primary study objective is to assess the positive predictive value of an irregular heart rhythm detection for AF during the ECG patch monitor period. Additional objectives will examine the validity of irregular pulse tachograms during subsequent heart rhythm detections, self-reported AF diagnoses and treatments, and relations between irregular heart rhythm detections and AF episode duration and time spent in AF. Conclusions The Fitbit Heart Study is a large-scale remote clinical trial comprising a unique software algorithm for detection of AF. The study results will provide critical insights into the use of consumer wearable technology for AF detection, and for characterizing the nature of AF episodes detected using consumer-based PPG technology.

AB  - Background and objective: In this work, we address the problem of detecting and discriminating acute psychological stress (APS) in the presence of concurrent physical activity (PA) using wristband biosignals. We focused on signals available from wearable devices that can be worn in daily life because the ultimate objective of this work is to provide APS and PA information in real-time management of chronic conditions such as diabetes by automated personalized insulin delivery. Monitoring APS noninvasively throughout free-living conditions remains challenging because the responses to APS and PA of many physiological variables measured by wearable devices are similar. Methods: Various classification algorithms are compared to simultaneously detect and discriminate the PA (sedentary state, treadmill running, and stationary bike) and the type of APS (non-stress state, mental stress, and emotional anxiety). The impact of APS inducements is verified with commonly used self-reported questionnaires (The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)). To aid the classification algorithms, novel features are generated from the physiological variables reported by a wristband device during 117 hours of experiments involving simultaneous APS inducement and PA. We also translate the APS assessment into a quantitative metric for use in predicting the adverse outcomes. Results: An accurate classification of the concurrent PA and APS states is achieved with an overall classification accuracy of 99% for PA and 92% for APS. The average accuracy of APS detection during sedentary state, treadmill running, and stationary bike is 97.3, 94.1, and 84.5%, respectively. Conclusions: The simultaneous assessment of APS and PA throughout free-living conditions from a convenient wristband device is useful for monitoring the factors contributing to an elevated risk of acute events in people with chronic diseases like cardiovascular complications and diabetes.

AB  - Background and Objectives:
   Caregiver burden associated with dementia-related agitation is one of the commonest reasons a community-dwelling person with dementia (PWD) transitions to a care facility. Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention for Dementia Caregiver Empowerment (BESI) is a system of body-worn and in-home sensors developed to provide continuous, noninvasive agitation assessment and environmental context monitoring to detect early signs of agitation and its environmental triggers.
   Research Design and Methods:
   This mixed methods, remote ethnographic study is explored in a 3-phase, multiyear plan. In Phase 1, we developed and refined the BESI system and completed usability studies. Validation of the system and the development of dyad-specific models of the relationship between agitation and the environment occurred in Phase 2.
   Results:
   Phases 1 and 2 results facilitated targeted changes in BESI, thus improving its overall usability for the final phase of the study, when real-time notifications and interventions will be implemented.
   Conclusion:
   Our results show a valid relationship between the presence of dementia related agitation and environmental factors and that persons with dementia and their caregivers prefer a home-based monitoring system like BESI.

AB  - BACKGROUND The electronic Framingham Heart Study (eFHS) is an ongoing nested study, which includes FHS study participants, examining associations between health data from mobile devices with cardiovascular risk factors and disease.
   OBJECTIVE To describe application (app) design, report user characteristics, and describe usability and survey response rates.
   METHODS Eligible FHS participants were consented and offered a smartwatch (Apple Watch), a digital blood pressure (BP) cuff, and the eFHS smartphone app for administering surveys remotely. We assessed usability of the new app using 2 domains (functionality, aesthetics) of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) and assessed survey completion rates at baseline and 3 months.
   RESULTS A total of 196 participants were recruited using the enhanced eFHS app. Of these, 97 (49.5%) completed the MARS instrument. Average age of participants was 53 +/- 9 years, 51.5% were women, and 93.8% were white. Eighty-six percent of participants completed at least 1 measure on the baseline survey, and 50% completed the 3-month assessment. Overall subjective score of the app was 4.2 +/- 0.7 on a scale from 1 to 5 stars. Of those who shared their health data with others, 46% shared their BP and 7.7% shared their physical activity with a health care provider.
   CONCLUSION Participants rated the new, enhanced eFHS app positively overall. Mobile app survey completion rates were high, consistent with positive in-app ratings from participants. These mobile data collection modalities offer clinicians new opportunities to engage in conversations about health behaviors.

AB  - Background: A noninvasive, wearable continuous glucose monitor would be a major advancement in diabetes therapy. This trial investigated a novel noninvasive glucose monitor which analyzes spectral variations in radio frequency/microwave signals reflected from the wrist. Methods: A single-arm, open-label, experimental study compared glucose values from a prototype investigational device with laboratory glucose measurements from venous blood samples (Super GL Glucose Analyzer, Dr. Muller Geratebau GmbH) at varying levels of glycemia. The study included 29 male participants with type 1 diabetes (age range = 19-56 years). The study comprised three stages with the following aims: (1) demonstrate initial proof-of-principle, (2) test an improved device design, and (3) test performance on two consecutive days without device recalibration. The co-primary endpoints in all trial stages were median and mean absolute relative difference (ARD) calculated across all data points. Results: In stage 1, the median and mean ARDs were 30% and 46%, respectively. Stage 2 produced marked performance improvements with a median and mean ARD of 22% and 28%, respectively. Stage 3 showed that, without recalibration, the device performed as well as the initial prototype (stage 1) with a median and mean ARD of 35% and 44%, respectively. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study shows that a novel noninvasive continuous glucose monitor was capable of detecting glucose levels. Furthermore, the ARD results are comparable to first models of commercially available minimally invasive products without the need to insert a needle. The prototype has been further developed and is being tested in subsequent studies.

AB  - Introduction: Wearable robots controlled using electromyography could motivate greater use of the affected upper extremity after stroke and enable bimanual activities of daily living to be completed independently.
   Methods: We have developed a myoelectric untethered robotic glove (My-HERO) that provides five-finger extension and grip assistance.
   Results: The myoelectric controller detected the grip and release intents of the 9 participants after stroke with 84.7% accuracy. While using My-HERO, all 9 participants performed better on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Hand (8.4 point increase, scale out of 14, p < 0.01) and the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (8.2 point increase, scale out of 91, p < 0.01). Established criteria for clinically meaningful important differences were surpassed for both the hand function and daily living task assessments. The majority of participants provided satisfaction and usability questionnaire scores above 70%. Seven participants desired to use My-HERO in the clinic and at home during their therapy and daily routines.
   Conclusions: People with hand impairment after stroke value that myoelectric untethered robotic gloves enhance their motion and bimanual task performance and motivate them to use their muscles during engaging activities of daily living. They desire to use these gloves daily to enable greater independence and investigate the effects on neuromuscular recovery.

AB  - The ageing of the global population is creating a crisis in chronic disease management. In the USA, 29 million people (or 9.3% of the population) suffer from the chronic disease of diabetes; according to the WHO, globally around 200 million people are diabetic. Left unchecked, diabetes can lead to acute and long-term complications and ultimately death. Diabetes prevalence tends to be the highest among those aged 65 and older (nearly 20.6%), a population which often lacks the cognitive resources to deal with the daily self-management regimens. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of an Internet-of-Things (IoT) and wireless sensor system which patients use in their own homes to capture daily activity, an important component in diabetes management. Following Fogg's 2009 persuasion theory, we mine the activity data and provide motivational messages to the subjects with the intention of changing their activity and dietary behaviour. We introduce a novel idea called "persuasive sensing" and report results from two home implementations that show exciting promise. With the captured home monitoring data, we also develop analytic models that can predict blood glucose levels for the next day with an accuracy of 94%. We conclude with lessons learned from these two home case studies and explore design principles for creating novel IoT systems.

AB  - Recently, the mobile health care (m-healthcare) applications with Internet of Things (IoT) are providing the various dimensionalities and the online services. These applications have provided a new platform to the millions of people for getting benefit over the health tips frequently for living a healthy life. After the introduction of IoT technology and the related devices which are used in medical field, strengthened the various features of these healthcare online applications. The huge volume of big data is generated by IoT devices in healthcare environment. Cloud computing technology is used to handle the large volume of data and also provide the ease of use. In this scenario, cloud based applications are playing major role in this fast world. These medical applications are also used the Cloud Computing technology for secured storage and accessibility. For availing better services to the people over the online healthcare applications, we propose a new Cloud and IoT based Mobile Health care application for monitoring and diagnosing the serious diseases. Here, a new framework is developed for the public. In this work, a new systematic approach is used for the diabetes diseases and the related medical data is generated by using the UCI Repository dataset and the medical sensors for predicting the people who has affected with diabetes severely. In addition, we propose a new classification algorithm called Fuzzy Rule based Neural Classifier for diagnosing the disease and the severity. The experiments have been conducted by the standard UCI Repository dataset and the real health records which are collected from various hospitals. The experimental results show that the performance of the proposed work which outperforms the existing systems for disease prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - IntroductionEffectively engaging people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) earlier in their health journeys is critical to prevent downstream complications. Digitally based diabetes programs are a growing component of care delivery that have the potential to engage individuals outside of traditional clinic-based settings and use personalized data to pair people to tailored diabetes self-management interventions. Knowing an individuals' diabetes empowerment and health-related motivation can help drive appropriate recommendations for personalized interventions. We aimed to characterize diabetes empowerment and motivation towards changing health behaviors among participants in Level2, a T2D specialty care organization in the USA that combines wearable technology with personalized clinical support.MethodsA cross-sectional online survey was conducted among people enrolled in Level2 (February-March 2021). Distributions of respondent-reported diabetes empowerment and health motivation were analyzed using Motivation and Attitudes Toward Changing Health (MATCH) and Diabetes Empowerment Scale Short Form (DES-SF) scales, respectively. Associations between MATCH and DES-SF scores with Level2 engagement measures and glycemic control were analyzed.ResultsThe final analysis included 1258 respondents with T2D (mean age 55.7 +/- 8.4 years). Respondents had high average MATCH (4.19/5) and DES-SF (4.02/5) scores. The average MATCH subscores for willingness (4.43/5) and worthwhileness (4.39/5) were higher than the average ability subscore (3.73/5). Both MATCH and DES-SF scores showed very weak correlations with Level2 engagement measures and glycemic control (rho = - 0.18-0.19).ConclusionsLevel2 survey respondents had high average motivation and diabetes empowerment scores. Further research is needed to validate sensitivity of these scales to detect changes in motivation and empowerment over time and to determine whether differences in scores can be used to pair people to personalized interventions.

AB  - Background: In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) without clinical seizures, up to half have epileptiform discharges on long-term in-patient electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Long-term in-patient monitoring is obtrusive, and expensive as compared to outpatient monitoring. No studies have so far investigated if long-term outpatient EEG monitoring is able to identify epileptiform discharges in AD. Our aim is to investigate if epileptiform discharges as measured with ear-EEG are more common in patients with AD compared to healthy elderly controls (HC).Methods: In this longitudinal observational study, 24 patients with mild to moderate AD and 15 age-matched HC were included in the analysis. Patients with AD underwent up to three ear-EEG recordings, each lasting up to two days, within 6 months.Results: The first recording was defined as the baseline recording. At baseline, epileptiform discharges were detected in 75.0% of patients with AD and in 46.7% of HC (p-value = 0.073). The spike frequency (spikes or sharp waves/24 h) was significantly higher in patients with AD as compared to HC with a risk ratio of 2.90 (CI: 1.77-5.01, p < 0.001). Most patients with AD (91.7%) showed epileptiform discharges when combining all ear -EEG recordings.Conclusions: Long-term ear-EEG monitoring detects epileptiform discharges in most patients with AD with a three-fold increased spike frequency compared to HC, which most likely originates from the temporal lobes. Since most patients showed epileptiform discharges with multiple recordings, elevated spike frequency should be considered a marker of hyperexcitability in AD.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
KW  - DIABETES MANAGEMENT
AB  - This work introduces novel body-matched, vasculature-inspired, quasi-antenna-arrays that act as electromagnetic sensors to instantaneously, continuously, and wirelessly sense glucose variations in the bloodstream. The proposed sensors are personalized, leverage electromagnetic waves, and are coupled with a custom machine-learning-based signal-processing module. These sensors are flexible, and embedded in wearable garments such as socks, which provide conformity to curved skin surfaces and movement resilience. The entire wearable system is calibrated against temperature, humidity, and movement resulting in high accuracy in glucose variations tracking. In-Vivo experiments on diabetic rats and pigs exhibit a 100% diagnostic accuracy over a wide range of glucose variations. Human trials on patients with diabetes and healthy individuals reveal a clinical accuracy of continuous glucose monitoring of 99.01% in twenty-eight subjects who underwent Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests. Hence, our approach ensures the continuous tracking of glucose variations from hypo-to-hyper glycemic levels with great fidelity.

AB  - Many women diagnosed by traditional screening methods, such as palpation, mammography, and MRI, do not discover their cancer until it is relatively advanced. This makes treatment more difficult and reduces the chance of a cure. To deal with this issue, we have developed a noninvasive embedded thermography system that allows for an early detection of breast cancer. Indeed, the surface temperature distribution of the breast, which we will call the thermal image, can be used as a preventive indicator of the subsequent development of a cancerous tumor. This is due to the metabolic activity of the immune system, which induces, in the presence of cancer cells, a local increase of temperature even before the tumor tissue is differentiated and detectable by conventional imaging systems. The proposed system is designed as a network of bioheat microsensors applied to the breast, to measure periodically the temperature gradients on the surface. All the bioheat microsensors are addressed by a microcontroller via the I2C protocol. To calibrate and evaluate the proposed system, we have proposed an experimental model of the breast, inside which we have placed Joule effect heating elements.

AB  - Mobile Edge Computing and Communication (MECC) can be deployed in close proximity with sensing devices and act as middleware between cloud and local networks. The health and fitness movement has become extremely popular recently. Endurance activities, such as marathons, triathlons, and cycling have also grown in popularity. However, with more people participating in these activities, more accidents and injuries occur-ranging from heat stroke, to heart attacks, shock, or hypoxia. All physical training activities include a risk of injury and accidents. Therefore, any research that offers a means of reducing injury risk will significantly contribute to the personal fitness field. Moreover, with the growing popularity of wearable devices and the rise of the MECC, the development and application of wearable devices that can connect to the MECC has become widespread, producing many new innovations. Although many wearable devices, such as wrist straps and smart watches, are available and able to detect individual physiological data, they cannot monitor the human body in a state of motion. Therefore, this study proposes a set of monitoring parameters for a novel wearable device connected to the MECC based on fitness management to assist fitness trainers in effective prompted strength training, and to offer timely warnings in the event of an injury risk. The data collected by the monitoring device using fuzzy theory include risk factor, body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen concentration. The proposed system can display in real-time the current physiological state of a wearer/user. The introduction of this device will hopefully enable trainers to immediately and effectively control and monitor the intensity of a training session, while increasing training safety, and offer crucial and immediate diagnostic information so that the correct treatment can be applied without delay in the event of injury.

AB  - Objective: Development of wearable medical technology for remote monitoring of patients suffering from chronic lung diseases may improve the care, therapy and outcome of these patients. Approach: A multimodal system using wearable sensors for the acquisition of multiple biosignals (electrical bioimpedance of the chest for electrical impedance tomography and respiratory rate assessment, peripheral oxygen saturation, chest sounds, electrocardiography for heart rate measurement, body activity, and posture) was developed and validated in a prospective, monocentric study on 50 healthy subjects. The subjects were studied under different types of ventilation (tidal and deep breathing, forced full expiration maneuver) and during increased body activity and posture changes. The major goals were to assess the functionality by determining the presence and plausibility of the signals, comfort of wearing and safety of the vest. Main results: All intended signals were recorded. Streaming of selected signals and wireless download of complete data sets were functional. Electrical impedance tomography recordings revealed good to excellent quality of detection of ventilation-related impedance changes in 34 out of 50 participants. Respiratory and heart rates were reliably detected and generally in physiological ranges. Peripheral oxygen saturation values were unphysiologically low. The chest sound recordings did not show waveforms allowing meaningful analysis of lung sounds. Body activity and posture were correctly identified. The comfort of wearing and the vest properties were positively rated. No adverse events occurred. Significance: Albeit the full functionality of the current vest design was not established, the study confirmed the feasibility of remote functional chest monitoring with a marked increase in clinically relevant information compared to existing systems.

AB  - Background: The monitoring of caloric intake is an important challenge for the maintenance of individual and public health. The instruments used so far for dietary monitoring (eg, food frequency questionnaires, food diaries, and telephone interviews) are inexpensive and easy to implement but show important inaccuracies. Alternative methods based on wearable devices and wrist accelerometers have been proposed, yet they have limited accuracy in predicting caloric intake because analytics are usually not well suited to manage the massive sets of data generated from these types of devices.
   Objective: This study aims to develop an algorithm using recent advances in machine learning methodology, which provides a precise and stable estimate of caloric intake.
   Methods: The study will capture four individual eating activities outside the home over 2 months. Twenty healthy Italian adults will be recruited from the University of Padova in Padova, Italy, with email, flyers, and website announcements. The eligibility requirements include age 18 to 66 years and no eating disorder history. Each participant will be randomized to one of two menus to be eaten on weekdays in a predefined cafeteria in Padova (northeastern Italy). Flows of raw data will be accessed and downloaded from the wearable devices given to study participants and associated with anthropometric and demographic characteristics of the user (with their written permission). These massive data flows will provide a detailed picture of real-life conditions and will be analyzed through an up-to-date machine learning approach with the aim to accurately predict the caloric contribution of individual eating activities. Gold standard evaluation of the energy content of eaten foods will be obtained using calorimetric assessments made at the Laboratory of Dietetics and Nutraceutical Research of the University of Padova.
   Results: The study will last 14 months from July 2017 with a final report by November 2018. Data collection will occur from October to December 2017. From this study, we expect to obtain a series of relevant data that, opportunely filtered, could allow the construction of a prototype algorithm able to estimate caloric intake through the recognition of food type and the number of bites. The algorithm should work in real time, be embedded in a wearable device, and able to match bite-related movements and the corresponding caloric intake with high accuracy.
   Conclusions: Building an automatic calculation method for caloric intake, independent on the black-box processing of the wearable devices marketed so far, has great potential both for clinical nutrition (eg, for assessing cardiovascular compliance or for the prevention of coronary heart disease through proper dietary control) and public health nutrition as a low-cost monitoring tool for eating habits of different segments of the population.

AB  - Epitel has developed Epilog, a miniature, wireless, wearable electroencephalography (EEG) sensor. Four Epilog sensors are combined as part of Epitel's Remote EEG Monitoring platform (REMI) to create 10 channels of EEG for remote patient monitoring. REMI is designed to provide comprehensive spatial EEG recordings that can be administered by non-specialized medical personnel in any medical center. The purpose of this study was to determine how accurate epileptologists are at remotely reviewing Epilog sensor EEG in the 10-channel "REMI montage," with and without seizure detection support software. Three board certified epileptologists reviewed the REMI montage from 20 subjects who wore four Epilog sensors for up to 5 days alongside traditional video-EEG in the EMU, 10 of whom experienced a total of 24 focal-onset electrographic seizures and 10 of whom experienced no seizures or epileptiform activity. Epileptologists randomly reviewed the same datasets with and without clinical decision support annotations from an automated seizure detection algorithm tuned to be highly sensitive. Blinded consensus review of unannotated Epilog EEG in the REMI montage detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Consensus detection of individual focal onset seizures resulted in a mean sensitivity of 61%, precision of 80%, and false detection rate (FDR) of 0.002 false positives per hour (FP/h) of data. With algorithm seizure detection annotations, the consensus review mean sensitivity improved to 68% with a slight increase in FDR (0.005 FP/h). As seizure detection software, the automated algorithm detected people who were experiencing electrographic seizure activity with 100% sensitivity and 70% specificity, and detected individual focal onset seizures with a mean sensitivity of 90% and mean false alarm rate of 0.087 FP/h. This is the first study showing epileptologists' ability to blindly review EEG from four Epilog sensors in the REMI montage, and the results demonstrate the clinical potential to accurately identify patients experiencing electrographic seizures. Additionally, the automated algorithm shows promise as clinical decision support software to detect discrete electrographic seizures in individual records as accurately as FDA-cleared predicates.</p>

AB  - BACKGROUND: Morbidity from undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) may be preventable with early detection. Many consumer wearables contain optical photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors to measure pulse rate. PPG-based software algorithms that detect irregular heart rhythms may identify undiagnosed AF in large populations using wearables, but minimizing false-positive detections is essential.
   METHODS: We performed a prospective remote clinical trial to examine a novel PPG-based algorithm for detecting undiagnosed AF from a range of wrist-worn devices. Adults aged >= 22 years in the United States without AF, using compatible wearable Fitbit devices and Android or iOS smartphones, were included. PPG data were analyzed using a novel algorithm that examines overlapping 5-minute pulse windows (tachograms). Eligible participants with an irregular heart rhythm detection (IHRD), defined as 11 consecutive irregular tachograms, were invited to schedule a telehealth visit and were mailed a 1-week ambulatory ECG patch monitor. The primary outcome was the positive predictive value of the first IHRD during ECG patch monitoring for concurrent AF.
   RESULTS: A total of 455 699 participants enrolled (median age 47 years, 71% female, 73% White) between May 6 and October 1, 2020. IHRDs occurred for 4728 (1%) participants, and 2070 (4%) participants aged >= 65 years during a median of 122 (interquartile range, 110-134) days were at risk for an IHRD. Among 1057 participants with an IHRD notification and subsequent analyzable ECG patch monitor, AF was present in 340 (32.2%). Of the 225 participants with another IHRD during ECG patch monitoring, 221 had concurrent AF on the ECG and 4 did not, resulting in an IHRD positive predictive value of 98.2% (95% CI, 95.5%-99.5%). For participants aged >= 65 years, the IHRD positive predictive value was 97.0% (95% CI, 91.4%-99.4%).
   CONCLUSIONS: A novel PPG software algorithm for wearable Fitbit devices exhibited a high positive predictive value for concurrent AF and identified participants likely to have AF on subsequent ECG patch monitoring. Wearable devices may facilitate identifying individuals with undiagnosed AF.

AB  - Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can easily accumulate in indoor environments. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), radon gas is the second largest risk factor associated with lung cancer, after tobacco smoking. People spend at least half their life inside buildings, which are becoming increasingly more hermetic due to the pursuit of high energy efficiency - an increase in ventilation rates tends to increase heat losses. In this context, energy efficiency and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) concepts, if not studied in a balanced way, can move in opposite directions. The introduction of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for continuous assessment of the IAQ can help to achieve an optimally integrated balance between them. This article focus on the specification and design of the RnProbe, an IoT Edge Device developed under the scope of the RnMonitor R&D project whose main objective was the specification and development of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for integrated Radon Risk Management in public buildings, such as schools, kindergartens, offices, and hospitals, that are restricted to regular occupancy schedules, so that policymakers and building managers can reduce public health risks associated with the exposure to this pollutant. The device collects, aggregates, and transmits up to the cloud, several indoor environmental parameters. When combined these measurements are used to perform specific mitigation actions in the building, to improve IAQ.

KW  - TIME
AB  - Brain stroke treatments are strongly time-dependent. Indeed, the literature stresses the need for quick diagnosis to guarantee the most effective therapy with the famous motto "time is brain" [1]. Numerically speaking, a crucial goal for strokes is trying to achieve a door-to-needle time shorter than 60 minutes, called The Golden Hour [2], within which patients have the highest probability of a full recovery. This article presents a prototype of a Smart Helmet, a wearable device originally introduced in [3, 4], thought to be employed on site, to efficiently recognize and detect a brain stroke in a patient when the first aid medical team arrives. This work presents two different but complementary approaches: signal-processing-based and electromagnetic (EM). The former aims at outputting a two-level diagnosis: the presence (or not) of a stroke and (if it is present) of which type (ischemic or hemorrhagic), while the latter provides an accurate imaging of the brain that must be interpreted by medical staff. Both approaches are analyzed and compared, showing their strengths and high-lighting their weaknesses.

AB  - Given the increased interest in a fast, portable, and on-spot medical diagnostic tool that enables early diagnosis for patients with brain stroke, a new approach of a wearable electromagnetic head imaging system based on the polymer material is proposed. A flexible low-profile, wideband, and unidirectional antenna array with electromagnetic band gap (EBG) and metamaterial (MTM) unit cells reflector is utilized. The designed antenna consists of a 4 x 4 radiating patch loaded with symmetrical extended open-ended U-slots and fed by combination of series and corporate transmission lines. A mushroom-like 10-EBG unit cell arrays are arranged around the feeding network to reduce surface waves, whereas 4 x 4 MTM unit cells are placed on the back-side of the antenna to enable unidirectional radiation. The antenna is designed and embedded on a multilayer low cost, low loss, transparent, and robust polymer poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS) substrate and optimized to operate in contact with the human head. The simulated and measured results show that the antenna has a fractional bandwidth of 53.8% (1.16-1.94 GHz), more than 80% of radiation efficiency, and satisfactory field penetration in the head tissues with a safe specific absorption rate. An eight-element array is then configured on 300 x 360 x 4.1 mm(3) PDMS material covering an average human head size and used as a worn part of the imaging system. A realistic-shaped 3-D specific anthropomorphic mannequin (SAM) head phantom is used to verify the performance of the designed array. The imaging results indicate the possibility of using the designed conformal array to detect a bleeding inside the brain using a confocal image algorithm.

AB  - Wearable non-invasive sensors facilitate the con-tinuous measurement of glucose in sweat for the treatment and management of diabetes. However, the catalysis of glucose and sweat sampling are challenges in the development of efficient wearable glucose sensors. Herein, we report a flexible wearable non-enzymatic electrochemical sensor for continuous glucose detection in sweat. We synthesized a catalyst (Pt/MXene) by the hybridization of Pt nanoparticles onto MXene (Ti3C2Tx) nanosheets with a broad linear range of glucose detection (0-8 mmol/L) under neutral conditions. Furthermore, we optimized the structure of the sensor by immobilizing Pt/MXene with a conductive hydrogel to enhance the stability of the sensor. Based on Pt/MXene and the optimized structure, we fabricated a flexible wearable glucose sensor by integrating a microfluidic patch for sweat collection onto a flexible sensor. We evaluated the utility of the sensor for the detection of glucose in sweat, and the sensor could detect the glucose change with the replenishment and consumption of energy by the body, and a similar trend was observed in the blood. An in vivo glucose test in sweat indicated that the fabricated sensor is promising for the continuous measurement of glucose, which is essential for the treatment and management of diabetes.

TI  - Rationale and design of a home-based trial using wearable sensors to detect asymptomatic atrial fibrillation in a targeted population: The mHealth Screening To Prevent Strokes (mSToPS) trial

AB  - Efficient methods for screening populations for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) are needed to reduce its associated mortality, morbidity, and costs. The use of digital technologies, including wearable sensors and large health record data sets allowing for targeted outreach toward individuals at increased risk for AF, might allow for unprecedented opportunities for effective, economical screening. The trial's primary objective is to determine, in a real-world setting, whether using wearable sensors in a risk-targeted screening population can diagnose asymptomatic AF more effectively than routine care. Additional key objectives include (1) exploring 2 rhythm-monitoring strategies-electrocardiogram-based and exploratory pulse wave-based-for detection of new AF, and (2) comparing long-term clinical and resource outcomes among groups. In all, 2,100 Aetna members will be randomized 1:1 to either immediate or delayed monitoring, in which a wearable patch will capture a single-lead electrocardiogram during the first and last 2 weeks of a 4-month period beginning immediately or 4 months after enrollment, respectively. An observational, risk factor-matched control group (n = 4,000) will be developed from members who did not receive an invitation to participate. The primary end point is the incidence of new AF in the immediate-vs delayed-monitoring arms at the end of the 4-month monitoring period. Additional efficacy and safety end points will be captured at 1 and 3 years. The results of this digital medicine trial might benefit a substantial proportion of the population by helping identify and refine screening methods for undiagnosed AF.

AB  - Background: Cancer survivors who meet physical activity (PA) recommendations (>= 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [MVPA] per week) experience better health outcomes. With the growing availability of wearable activity trackers (WATs), it may be easier to track PA. However, it is unknown what motivates survivors to use these devices.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the associations among motivations for exercise, previous WAT use for tracking a health goal or activity, and meeting the recommended amount of PA among a cohort of cancer survivors.
   Methods: Data on WAT users who reported having a previous cancer diagnosis were analyzed from the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey 5 Cycle 3. All survivors with complete information on demographics, exercise motivations (internal guilt, external pressure, physical appearance, and exercise enjoyment), previous WAT use (yes or no), and minutes of MVPA per week (N=608) were included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to test these associations. A separate cluster analysis was conducted to identify the profiles of exercise motivation that were associated with reporting WAT use.
   Results: The mean age of the cohort was 66.9 years (SD 12.1). The majority were non-Hispanic White (473/608, 78.8%) and female (322/608, 54.9%), and skin cancer was the most commonly reported diagnosed cancer (154/608, 27.8%). Survivors who reported using WATs to track a health goal or activity were 1.6 times more likely to meet MVPA recommendations than those who did not use WATs (odds ratio [OR] 1.65, 95% CI 1.03-2.65; P=.04). When exercise motivations were assessed independently, survivors who reported not feeling any internal guilt as an exercise motivation were 73% less likely to report having used a WAT than those who felt any internal guilt (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14-0.54; P<.001). A total of 3 distinct motivational profiles emerged from the cluster analysis. WAT users had an increased probability of membership in profile 3, which was characterized as being strongly motivated to exercise by internal guilt, physical appearance, and exercise enjoyment (OR 4.5, 95% CI 2.1-9.7; P<.001).
   Conclusions: Among this cohort, survivors who reported using WATs to track a health goal or activity were significantly more likely to report meeting PA recommendations. Survivors who reported feeling internal guilt as an exercise motivation were significantly more likely to report using WATs to track a health goal or activity. When examining clusters of motivation, survivors who reported previous WAT use were more likely to report being motivated to exercise by a mix of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, including internal guilt, exercise enjoyment, and physical appearance. Given the health benefits of PA for cancer survivors, technology-focused interventions that use WATs and target exercise motivation may aid in cancer survivors meeting the level of recommended PA.

AB  - Cryptogenic stroke (CS) represents 1/3 of ischemic strokes. Atrial fibrillation (AF) can be detected in up to 30% of CS. Therefore, there is a clinical need for predicting AF to guide the optimal secondary prevention strategy. The evidence about the role of advanced echo-cardiography, including left atrial 3-dimensional (3D) index volume and left atrial strain (LAS) techniques, to predict underlying AF in this setting is lacking. From April 2019 to November 2021, 78 consecutive patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack with ABCD2 scale >= 4 of unknown etiology were prospectively recruited. Echocardiogra-phy was performed during admission. All patients underwent 15 days of wearable Holter monitoring. The primary outcome measure was AF detection during follow-up. Twenty-two patients (28%) developed AF. Patients in the AF group were older (81 +/- 6.3 vs 76.5 +/- 7.8 years; p = 0.012). Left atrial (LA) diastolic indexed volume was higher in the AF group (37.2 +/- 12.8 vs 29.7 +/- 11 ml/m2 p = 0.01). Three-D LA indexed volume was also higher in patients with AF (41.4 +/- 14 vs 32.2 +/- 10 ml/m2 p = 0.009). LAS reservoir, LAS conduct, and LAS contraction (LASct) were significantly lower in patients with AF (19 +/- 5.6 vs 32% +/- 10.3%; 9 +/- 4.5 vs 15 +/- 7.6; 10 +/- 5.3 vs 17 +/- 6.4, respectively, all p <0.001). On multivariate analysis, LASct <13.5% and LA 3D indexed volume >44.5 ml/m2 were inde-pendent predictors of AF (odds ratio 10.9 [95% confidence interval 1.09 to 108.2], p = 0.042). In conclusion, LASct <13.5% and LA 3D indexed volume >44.5 ml/m2 are independent predictors of underlying AF in patients with CS. Our results show the useful-ness of advanced echocardiography in this challenging clinical setting. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol 2022;185:87-93)

AB  - Many real-time applications, including some emerging ones, rely on high-dimensional feature datasets. For simplifying the high-dimensional data, the various models are available by using the different feature optimization techniques, clustering and classification techniques. Even though the high-dimensional data is not handled effectively due to the increase in the number of features and the huge volume of data availability. In particular, the high-dimensional medical data needs to be handled effectively to predict diseases quickly. For this purpose, we propose a new Internet of Things and Fuzzy-aware e-healthcare system for predicting various diseases such as heart, diabetes, and cancer diseases effectively. The proposed system uses a newly proposed Intelligent Mahalanobis distance aware Fuzzy Weighted K-Means Clustering Algorithm (IMFWKCA) for grouping the high dimensional data and also applies a newly proposed Moth-Flame Optimization Tuned Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (MFO-TCNN) for predicting the diseases effectively. The experiments have been done by using the UCI Repository Machine Learning datasets and live streaming patient records for evaluating the proposed e-healthcare system and have proved as better than others by achieving better performance in terms of precision, recall, f-measure, and prediction accuracy.

AB  - Diabetes is characterized by a high prevalence of vulnerable food habits and poor management, resulting in a high risk of premature death. Maintaining a healthy blood glucose level has several health advantages which lower the risk of diabetes. Continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels in real time is a big issue. Monitoring just glucose levels without taking account of other indicators such as ECG and physical activity, on the other hand, might lead to incorrect treatment. As a result, the ever-increasing need for an all-encompassing healthcare system has prompted the use of prominent innovations including fog-cloud computing and wireless communication network. However, complex computation, delay, and portability issues come from the use of these approaches. This paper proposes a fog computing-inspired health framework to regulate human diabetic levels to solve the aforementioned concerns. The J48Graft decision tree is utilized to forecast diabetes vulnerability with a greater level of classification accuracy. An emergency signal is issued instantly for preventive actions when fog computing is utilized. The suggested framework performs better in terms of precision, energy effectiveness, computing complexity, and delay, as evidenced by the experimental findings concerning state-of-the-art decision-making techniques.

AB  - In modern healthcare, sensing technologies such as IoT empower the quality of assisted living service by knowing what a resident is doing in real-time. Using extreme connectivity and cloud computing in a smart home, where a collection of sensors is installed, the sensors sample continuously from the movements of the resident as well as ambient data from the surrounding inside the house. Automatic human activity recognition of the resident's activities is one of the key components of assisted living in smart home. For monitoring in-home safety, the ability in recognizing abnormal activities such as accident, falling, acute disease attack (e.g. asthma, stroke, etc.), fainting, wobbling, is particularly important. The detection and machine learning process must be both accurate and fast, to cope with the real-time activity recognition. To this end, a novel streamlined sensor data processing method is proposed called Evolutionary Expand-and-Contract Instance-based Learning algorithm (EEAC-IBL). The multivariate data stream is first expanded into many subspaces, then the subspaces which are corresponding to the characteristics of the features are selected and condensed into a significant feature subset. The selection operates scholastically instead of deterministically by evolutionary optimization which approximates the best subgroup. Followed by data stream mining, the machine learning for activity recognition is done on the fly. This approach is unique and suitable for such extreme connectivity scenario where precise feature selection is not required, and the relative importance of each feature among the sensor data changes over time. This stochastic approximation method is fast and accurate, offering an alternative to traditional machine learning method for smart home activity recognition application. Our experimental results show computing advantages over other classical approaches.

AB  - Significance: There is an essential need to develop wearable multimodality technologies that can continuously measure both blood flow and oxygenation in deep tissues to investigate and manage various vascular/cellular diseases.
   Aim: To develop a wearable dual-wavelength diffuse speckle contrast flow oximetry (DSCFO) for simultaneous measurements of blood flow and oxygenation variations in deep tissues.
   Approach: A wearable fiber-free DSCFO probe was fabricated using 3D printing to confine two small near-infrared laser diodes and a tiny CMOS camera in positions for DSCFO measurements. The spatial diffuse speckle contrast and light intensity measurements at the two different wavelengths enable quantification of tissue blood flow and oxygenation, respectively. The DSCFO was first calibrated using tissue phantoms and then tested in adult forearms during artery cuff occlusion.
   Results: Phantom tests determined the largest effective source-detector distance (15 mm) and optimal camera exposure time (10 ms) and verified the accuracy of DSCFO in measuring absorption coefficient variations. The DSCFO detected substantial changes in forearm blood flow and oxygenation resulting from the artery occlusion, which meet physiological expectations and are consistent with previous study results.
   Conclusions: The wearable DSCFO may be used for continuous and simultaneous monitoring of blood flow and oxygenation variations in freely behaving subjects. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) and cloud computing have now evolved to the point where they are able to be used effectively. Further improvement, however, is required when both of these technologies are combined to reap maximum benefits. A way of improving the system is by enabling healthcare workers to select appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction and, secondly, by preserving the privacy of patient data so that it cannot be misused. The purpose of this paper is to combine these promising technologies to maintain the privacy of patient data during the disease prediction process. Treatment of heart failure may be improved and expedited with this framework. We used the following machine learning algorithms to make predictions: Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). These techniques, combined with cloud computing services, improved the process of deciding whether to treat a patient with cardiac disease. Using our classifiers, we classified cardiac patients according to their features, which are grouped into single features, combinations of selected features, and all features. In experiments using all clinical features, machine learning classifiers SVM, DT, and KNN outperformed the rest, whereas in experiments using minimal clinical features, SVM and KNN were the most accurate. Internet of Things (IoT) devices allow family physicians to share diagnostic reports on the cloud in a secure manner. Ring signatures are particularly useful for verifying the integrity of data exchange. Our system keeps the physician's identity confidential from all authorized users, who can still access medical reports publicly. Our proposed mechanism has been shown to be both effective and efficient when it comes to obtaining patient reports from cloud storage.

AB  - Background: Managing glycemia during and after exercise events in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is challenging since these events can have wide-ranging effects on glycemia depending on the event timing, type, intensity. To this end, advanced physical activity-informed technologies can be beneficial for improving glucose control. Methods: We propose a real-time physical activity detection and classification framework, which builds upon random forest models. This module automatically detects exercise sessions and predicts the activity type and intensity from tri-axial accelerometer, heart rate, and continuous glucose monitoring records. Results: Data from 19 adults with T1D who performed structured sessions of either aerobic, resistance, or high-intensity interval exercise at varying times of day were used to train and test this framework. The exercise onset and completion were both predicted within 1 minute with an average accuracy of 81% and 78%, respectively. Activity type and intensity were identified within 2.38 minutes and from the exercise onset. On participants assigned to the test set, the average accuracy for activity type and intensity classification was 74% and 73%, respectively, if exercise was announced. For unannounced exercise events, the classification accuracy was 65% for the activity type and 70% for its intensity. Conclusions: The proposed module showed high performance in detection and classification of exercise in real-time within a minute of exercise onset. Integration of this module into insulin therapy decisions can help facilitate glucose management around physical activity.

AB  - Microdistance sensor, which can accurately detect the microdistance change, possesses significant applications in the cutting-edge technologies including biomedicine, energy storage, and info-communications. However, the high cost, complicated operation, and stringent testing requirements of the existing microdistance sensors limit their widespread application in the frontier fields, especially for the intelligent wearable electronics. Herein, a novel mechanism to detect microdistance change is developed, in which the external microdistance brings a change in the thickness of conductive textile and further converts into a distinguishable electrical signal. The polyester/polypyrrole (PET/PPy) conductive textile is fabricated via in situ solventless polymerization, and the derived microdistance sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 179 m(-1) within the detection region of 10-480 mu m, a high resolution up to 5 mu m, and good stability. The excellent sensing performance can be attributed to the high elasticity, deformation-recovery property, and 3D network structures of the PET/PPy conductive textile. Furthermore, the wearable sensor is applied to detect the microdistance changes in human and robot activities, providing an efficient and low-cost solution for microdistance detection in intelligent medical, health monitoring system, and biomimetic robot.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to independently validate a wearable inertial sensor designed to monitor training and performance metrics in swimmers. Methods: A total of 4 male (21 [4] y, 1 national and 3 international) and 6 female (22 [3] y, 1 national and 5 international) swimmers completed 15 training sessions in an outdoor 50-m pool. Swimmers were fitted with a wearable device (TritonWear, 9-axis inertial measurement unit with triaxial accelerometer, gyroscope, andmagnetometer), placed under the swim cap on top of the occipital protuberance. Video footage was captured for each session to establish criterion values. Absolute error, standardized effect, and Pearson correlation coefficient were used to determine the validity of the wearable device against video footage for total swim distance, total stroke count, mean stroke count, and mean velocity. A Fisher exact test was used to analyze the accuracy of stroke-type identification. Results: Total swim distance was underestimated by the device relative to video analysis. Absolute error was consistently higher for total and mean stroke count, and mean velocity, relative to video analysis. Across all sessions, the device incorrectly detected total time spent in backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle by 51% (15%). The device did not detect time spent in drill. Intraclass correlation coefficient results demonstrated excellent intrarater reliability between repeated measures across all swimming metrics. Conclusions: The wearable device investigated in this study does not accurately measure distance, stroke count, and velocity swimming metrics or detect stroke type. Its use as a training monitoring tool in swimming is limited.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Smart wearable devices are effective in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) prevention. However, factors determining their acceptance are poorly understood. This systematic review aims to examine the literature on patient and provider perspectives of smart wearable devices in DFU prevention. Materials and Methods: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched up to October 2021. The selected articles were assessed for methodological quality using the quality assessment tool for studies with diverse designs. Results: A total of five articles were identified and described. The methodological quality of the studies ranged from low to moderate. Two studies employed a quantitative study design and focused on the patient perspective, whereas three studies included a mixed, quantitative/qualitative design and explored patient or provider (podiatrist) perspectives. Four studies focused on an insole system and one included a smart sock device. The quantitative studies demonstrated that devices were comfortable, well designed and useful in preventing DFU. One mixed design study reported that patients did not intend to adopt an insole device in its current design because of malfunctions, a lack of comfort. and alert intrusiveness, despite the general perception that the device was a useful tool for foot risk monitoring. Two mixed design studies found that performance expectancy was a predictor of a podiatrist's behavioural intention to recommend an insole device in clinical practice. Disappointing participant experiences negatively impacted the podiatrists' intention to adopt a smart device. The need for additional refinements of the device was indicated by patients and providers before its use in this population. Conclusions: The current evidence about patient and provider perspectives on smart wearable technology is limited by scarce methodological quality and conflicting results. It is, thus, not possible to draw definitive conclusions regarding acceptability of these devices for the prevention of DFU in people with diabetes.

AB  - Purpose of review Determining the etiology of ischemic stroke is critical to administering targeted therapy to prevent recurrent stroke and further neurologic deterioration. Ischemic strokes of cardioembolic and cryptogenic etiologies are frequent and are often ultimately attributed to atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the paroxysmal nature of AF presents challenges for accurate and timely detection to prevent a recurrent stroke. The purpose of this review is to evaluate serologic, electrographic, echocardiographic, and radiologic markers of AF after an ischemic stroke.
   Recent findings Innovative applications of biotechnologies such as RNA gene expression profiling are being studied to characterize stroke etiology. Extended cardiac rhythm monitoring by implantable and wearable devices allows longer periods to capture paroxysmal AF. Echocardiographic measures including left atrial volume and parameters of left atrial strain increase the probability of detecting AF. Existing radiographic modalities are being investigated in novel ways to assess left atrial abnormalities associated with paroxysmal AF.
   Summary Emerging technologies and novel applications of existing methods are improving AF diagnostics in cryptogenic stroke patients with a high pre-test probability of this etiology. Future research will continue to optimize AF diagnosis after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke to inform clinical practice and prevent recurrent strokes.

AB  - Lifestyle influences morbidity and mortality rates in the world. Physical activity, a healthy weight, and a healthy diet are key preventative health behaviours that help reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular disease. A healthy lifestyle has been shown to prevent or delay chronic diseases and their complications, but few people follow all recommended self-management behaviours. This work seeks to improve knowledge of factors affecting type 2 diabetes selfmanagement and prevention through lifestyle changes. This paper describes the design, development, and testing of a diabetes self-management mobile app. The app tracked dietary consumption and health data. Bluetooth movement data from a pair of wearable insole devices are used to track carbohydrate intake, blood glucose, medication adherence, and physical activity. Two machine learning models were constructed to recognise sitting and standing. The SVM and decision tree models were 86% accurate for these tasks. The decision tree model is used in a real-time activity classification app. It is exciting to see more and more mobile health self-management apps being used to treat chronic diseases.

AB  - Background: Fluid overload has a high prevalence in haemodialysis patients and is an important risk factor for excess mortality and hospitalisations. Despite the risks associated with chronic fluid overload, it is clinically difficult to assess and maintain fluid status adequately. Current methods of fluid status assessment are either imprecise or time intensive. In particular, to date, no method exists to accurately assess fluid status during the interdialytic interval.
   Objectives: This pilot study aimed to evaluate whether a prototype wearable hydration monitor can accurately and reproducibly detect fluid overload in the haemodialysis population when compared to haemodialysis and bioimpedance data.
   Methods: A prospective, open-label, single-arm observational trial of 20 patients commenced in January 2021 in a single haemodialysis centre in Ireland, with a wearable hydration monitor, the Sixty device. The Sixty device uses diffuse reflectance spectroscopy to measure fluid levels at the level of the subdermis and uses machine learning to develop an algorithm that can determine fluid status. The Sixty device was worn at every dialysis session and nocturnally over a three-week observational period. Haemodialysis parameters including interdialytic weight gain, ultrafiltration volume, blood pressure, and relative blood volume were collected from each session, and bioimpedance measurements using the Fresenius body composition monitor were performed on 4 occasions as a comparator. The primary objective of this trial was to determine the accuracy and reproducibility of the Sixty device compared to bioimpedance measurements.
   Conclusion: If the accuracy of the wearable hydration monitor is validated, further studies will be conducted to integrate the device output into a multi-parameter machine learning algorithm that can provide patients with actionable insights to manage fluid overload in the interdialytic period.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) has gain the importance with the growing applications in the fields of ubiquitous and context-aware computing. In IoT, anything can be a portion of it, whether it is unintelligent objects or sensor nodes; thus extremely different kinds of services can be developed. In this regard, data storage, resource management, service creation and discovery, and resource and power management would facilitate advanced mechanism and much better infrastructure. Cloud computing and fog computing play an important role when the quantity of data and information IoT are critical. Thus, it would not be potential for standalone strength forced IoT to handle. Cloud of things is an integration of IoT with cloud computing or fog computing which can aid to realize the objectives of evolving IoT and future Internet. Fog computing is an expansion to the notion of cloud computing to the network brim, making it suitable for IoT and other implementations that need real-time and fundamental interactions. Regardless of many virtually and services unlimited resources presented by cloud-like intelligent building monitoring and others, it yet countenances various difficulties when interfering many smart things in human's life. Mobility, response time, and location consciousness are the most prominent problems. Fog and mobile edge computing have been established, to get rid of these difficulties of cloud computing. In this article, we suggest a novel framework based on computer propped diagnosis and IoT to detect and observe type-2 diabetes patients. The recommended healthcare system aims to obtain a better accuracy of diagnosis with mysterious data. The overall experimental results indicate the validity and robustness of our proposed algorithms.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of neurodegenerative disease and a leading cause of dementia today. A pathological effect of Alzheimer's disease is brain atrophy, which is the progressive shrinkage of the brain volume and weight. Another effect of Alzheimer's disease is the enlargement of lateral ventricles in the brain. Currently, MRI and CT scanners can detect and show images of the brain during different stages of Alzheimer's disease. However, its limited accessibility, high costs, and static structure make it inconvenient for some to use. This paper presents the design and novel application of a wearable device comprising of flexible microwave antennas, with an operating frequency range of 800 MHz-2.5 GHz that detects the progression of brain atrophy and lateral ventricle enlargement in patients with Alzheimer's at the earliest stage possible. The operating principle of the antennas are simulated in near field using CST and the device is experimentally validated using lamb brain samples and samples representing cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). The measured reflection coefficients (S-11) and transmission coefficients (S-21) were found to correlate with changes in brain volume and changes in CSF volume successfully, thus giving an indication of the progression of Alzheimer's disease in a patient.

AB  - Purpose Pediatric patients with cancer are at high risk for severe infections. Infections can trigger changes of vital signs long before clinical symptoms arise. Continuous recording may detect such changes earlier than discrete measurements. We aimed to assess the feasibility of continuous recording of vital signs by a wearable device (WD) in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer.
   Methods In this prospective, observational single-center study, pediatric patients under chemotherapy wore the Everion (R) WD for 14 days. The predefined patient-specific goal was heart rate recorded in good quality during >= 18/24 h per day, on >= 7 consecutive days. The predefined criterion to claim feasibility was >= 15/20 patients fulfilling this patient-specific goal.
   Results Twenty patients were included (median age, 6 years; range, 2-16). Six patients aged 3-16 years fulfilled the patient-specific goal. Quality of heart rate recording was good during 3992 of 6576 (61%) hours studied and poor during 300 (5%) hours, and no data was recorded during 2284 (35%) hours. Eighteen of 20 participants indicated that this WD is acceptable to measure vital signs in children under chemotherapy.
   Conclusion The predefined feasibility criterion was not fulfilled. This was mainly due to important compliance problems and independent of the WD itself. However, continuous recording of vital signs was possible across a very wide age range in pediatric patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer. We recommend to study feasibility in the Everion (R) again, plus in further WDs, applying measures to enhance compliance.

AB  - Many patients with neurological disorders, such as Ataxia, do not have easy access to neurologists, -especially those living in remote localities and developing/underdeveloped countries. Ataxia is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that surfaces as difficulty with motor control, such as walking imbalance. Previous studies have attempted automatic diagnosis of Ataxia with the help of wearable biomarkers, Kinect, and other sensors. These sensors, while accurate, do not scale efficiently well to naturalistic deployment settings. In this study, we propose a method for identifying ataxic symptoms by analyzing videos of participants walking down a hallway, captured with a standard monocular camera. In a collaboration with 11 medical sites located in 8 different states across the United States, we collected a dataset of 155 videos along with their severity rating from 89 participants (24 controls and 65 diagnosed with or are pre-manifest spinocerebellar ataxias). The participants performed the gait task of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). We develop a computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate the participants from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose coordinates to capture gait characteristics such as step width, step length, swing, stability, speed, etc. Our system is able to identify and track a patient in complex scenarios. For example, if there are multiple people present in the video or an interruption from a passerby. Our Ataxia risk-prediction model achieves 83.06% accuracy and an 80.23% F1 score. Similarly, our Ataxia severity-assessment model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.6225 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient score of 0.7268. Our model competitively performed when evaluated on data from medical sites not used during training. Through feature importance analysis, we found that our models associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability with greater Ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we are releasing the models and the body-pose coordinate dataset to the research community - the largest dataset on ataxic gait (to our knowledge). Our models could contribute to improving health access by enabling remote Ataxia assessment in non-clinical settings without requiring any sensors or special cameras. Our dataset will help the computer science community to analyze different characteristics of Ataxia and to develop better algorithms for diagnosing other movement disorders.

AB  - The technological advancement in wireless health monitoring through the direct contact of the skin allows the development of light-weight wrist-worn wearable devices to be equipped with different sensors such as photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors. However, the motion artifact (MA) is possible to occur during daily activities. In this study, we attempted to perform a post-calibration of the heart rate (HR) estimation during the three possible states of average daily activity (resting, laying down, and intense treadmill activity states) in 29 participants (130 minutes/person) on four popular wearable devices: Fitbit Charge HR, Apple Watch Series 4, TicWatch Pro, and Empatica E4. In comparison to the standard measurement (HRECG), HR provided by Fitbit Charge HR (HRFitbit) yielded the highest error of 3.26 +/- 0.34 bpm in resting, 2.33 +/- 0.23 bpm in laying down, 9.53 +/- 1.47 bpm in intense treadmill activity states, and 5.02 +/- 0.64 bpm in all states combined among the four chosen devices. Following our improving HR estimation model with rolling windows as feature (HRR), the mean absolute error (MAE) was significantly reduced by 33.44% in resting, 15.88% in laying down, 9.55% in intense treadmill activity states, and 18.73% in all states combined. This demonstrates the feasibility of our proposed methods in order to correct and provide HR monitoring post-calibrated with high accuracy, raising further awareness of individual fitness in the daily application.

AB  - A real-time, adaptive algorithm based on two inertial and magnetic sensors placed on the shanks was developed for gait-event detection. For each leg, the algorithm detected the Initial Contact (IC), as the minimum of the flexion/extension angle, and the End Contact (EC) and the Mid-Swing (MS), as minimum and maximum of the angular velocity, respectively. The algorithm consisted of calibration, real-time detection, and step-by-step update. Data collected from 22 healthy subjects (21 to 85 years) walking at three self-selected speeds were used to validate the algorithm against the GaitRite system. Comparable levels of accuracy and significantly lower detection delays were achieved with respect to other published methods. The algorithm robustness was tested on ten healthy subjects performing sudden speed changes and on ten stroke subjects (43 to 89 years). For healthy subjects, F1-scores of 1 and mean detection delays lower than 14 ms were obtained. For stroke subjects, F1-scores of 0.998 and 0.944 were obtained for IC and EC, respectively, with mean detection delays always below 31 ms. The algorithm accurately detected gait events in real time from a heterogeneous dataset of gait patterns and paves the way for the design of closed-loop controllers for customized gait trainings and/or assistive devices.

AB  - Electroencephalography (EEG) is immediate and sensitive to cortical impairment resulting from ischemic stroke and is considered as the potential predictive tool of stroke onset, and post-stroke clinical management. Brainwave monitoring outside the heavily equipped clinical environment demands a low-cost, portable, and wearable EEG system. This study aims to assess the feasibility of using an ambulatory EEG system to classify the stroke patient group with neurological changes due to ischemic stroke and the control healthy adult group. HealthSOS, a real-time health monitoring system for stroke prognostics, is proposed here, which consists of an eye-mask embedded portable EEG device, data analytics, and medical ontology based health advisor service. This system was investigated with 37 stroke patients (mean age 71.6 years, 61% male) admitted in the emergency unit of a hospital and 36 healthy elderly volunteers (mean age 76 years, 28% male). EEG was recorded in resting-state using the portable device with frontal cortical electrodes (Fp1, Fp2) embedded in an eye-mask within 120 h after the onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke (confirmed clinically). The EEG data acquisition of the left and right brain hemispheres was done for at least 15 minutes in the awake resting state while subjects laid down on the bed. The statistical result shows that the revised brain symmetry index (rsBSI), the delta-alpha ratio, and the delta-theta ratio of the stroke group differ significantly from those of the healthy control group. In the machine learning analysis, the support vector machine (SVM) model shows the highest accuracy (Overall accuracy: 92%) and the highest Gini coefficient (95%) in classification performance. This study will be useful for early stroke prognostics and the management of post-stroke treatment.

AB  - There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The EMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grade for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community, and home-based rehabilitation.

AB  - A novel wearable multi-sensor data glove system is developed to explore the relation between finger spasticity and voluntary movement in patients with stroke. Many stroke patients suffer from finger spasticity, which is detrimental to their manual dexterity. Diagnosing and assessing the degrees of spasticity require neurological testing performed by trained professionals to estimate finger spasticity scores via the modified Ashworth scale (MAS). The proposed system offers an objective, quantitative solution to assess the finger spasticity of patients with stroke and complements the manual neurological test. In this work, the hardware and software components of this system are described. By requiring patients to perform five designated tasks, biomechanical measurements including linear and angular speed, acceleration, and pressure at every finger joint and upper limb are recorded, making up more than 1000 features for each task. We conducted a preliminary clinical test with 14 subjects using this system. Statistical analysis is performed on the acquired measurements to identify a small subset of features that are most likely to discriminate a healthy patient from patients suffering from finger spasticity. This encouraging result validates the feasibility of this proposed system to quantitatively and objectively assess finger spasticity.

TI  - Implementation of Artificial Neural Network to Predict Diabetes with High-Quality Health System
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA  - English
AB  - Patients with diabetes who are closely monitored have a higher overall quality of life than those who are not. Costs associated with healthcare can be decreased by utilising the Internet of Things (IoT), thanks to technological advancements. To satisfy the expectations of e-health applications, it is required for the development of the intelligent systems as well as increases the number of applications that are connected to the network. As a result, in order to achieve these goals, the cellular network should be capable of supporting intelligent healthcare applications that require high energy efficiency. In this paper, we model a neural network based ensemble voting classifier to predict accurately the diabetes in the patients via online monitoring. The study consists of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to monitor the instances of the patients. While monitoring, the data are transferred from IoT devices to smartphones and then to the cloud, where the process of classification takes place. The simulation is conducted on the collected samples using the python tool. The results of the simulation show that the proposed method achieves a higher accuracy rate, higher precision, recall, and f-measure than existing state-of-art ensemble models.

AB  - PURPOSE Given the established associations between performance status and survival in a variety of cancers, there is significant interest in using a biometric wearable device (WD) to predict outcomes in the oncology population. In this pilot study, we investigated the ability of a WD to predict meaningful clinical end points in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy.
   METHODS Patients receiving head and neck definitive chemoradiotherapy or postoperative radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in this pilot study, designed to show 90% compliance with using the device. Individuals were asked to wear the WD for 23 hours a day, and hospital admissions, pain medication usage, and FACT-G quality-of-life (QoL) score were prospectively recorded.
   RESULTS Fifty-one patients were enrolled and started using the WD, but eight patients stopped wearing it, resulting in a compliance probability of only 84%. There were 15 hospital admissions, 13 of which were planned for feeding tube placement. There was no step count threshold that predicted the need for admission or more pain medications. However, among the 25 patients with a significant reduction in FACT-G score, the average reductions in daily steps during the week and weekend before the decline were 988 (P = .005) and 1,311 (P = .018), respectively, and the odds of a QoL reduction were more than 4-fold higher among patients experiencing a week-to-week reduction of at least 1,000 daily steps. There was no association between heart rate and any end point.
   CONCLUSION Although not meeting the compliance goal, the majority of patients did use the WD. The WD signal could not identify patients requiring hospitalization or significantly more pain medication, but the finding of reduced step counts before a significant reduction in QoL is provocative.

AB  - BackgroundAbnormal synergy is a major stroke-related movement impairment that presents as an unintentional contraction of muscles throughout a limb. The flexion synergy, consisting of involuntary flexion coupling of the paretic elbow, wrist, and fingers, is caused by and proportional to the amount of shoulder abduction effort and limits reaching function. A wearable exoskeleton capable of predicting movement intent could augment abduction effort and therefore reduce the negative effects of distal joint flexion synergy. However, predicting movement intent from abnormally-coupled torques or EMG signals and subsequent use as a control signal remains elusive. One control strategy that has proven viable, effective, and computationally efficient in myoelectric prostheses for use in individuals with amputation is linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based pattern recognition. However, following stroke, shoulder effort has been shown to have a negative effect on classification accuracy of hand tasks due to the multi-joint torque coupling of abnormal synergy. This study focuses on the evaluation of an LDA-based classifier to predict individual degrees-of-freedom of the shoulder and elbow joints.MethodsSix degree-of-freedom load cell data along with eight channels of EMG data were recorded during eight tasks (shoulder abduction and adduction, horizontal abduction and adduction, internal rotation and external rotation, and elbow flexion and extension) and used to create feature sets for LDA-based classifiers to distinguish between these eight classes.ResultsCross-validation yielded functional offline classification accuracies (>90%) for two of the eight classes using EMG-only, four of the eight classes using load cell-only, and six of the eight classes using a combined feature set with average accuracies of 83, 91, and 92% respectively.ConclusionsThe most common misclassifications were between shoulder adduction and internal rotation followed by shoulder abduction and external rotation. It is unknown whether the strategies used were due to abnormal synergy or other factors. LDA-based pattern recognition may be a viable control option for predicting movement intention and providing a control signal for a wearable exoskeletal assistive device. Future work will need to test the approach in a more complex multi-joint task, specifically one that attempts to tease apart shoulder abduction/external rotation and adduction/internal rotation.

AB  - Heart is a vital component of every human health. The development of wearables and its sensor enables the possibility of easy-to-use real-time monitoring. The goal of this study is to improve an IoT monitoring system by enabling real-time heart rate monitoring and analysis, also to assess the use of PPG sensors in smart wearables compared to other clinical-tested heart rate sensors. The PPG sensor will be used to record heart rate data of the user physically. The measurements are then sent to the application for pre-processing. The application can then transmit the pre-processed measurements to the cloud server for monitoring or further analysis, i.e. to assess the health of users' heart. The measurement comparison with measurement collected by a BCG sensor is carried out in this paper. While neither are standard for heart rate measurements, the findings of the evaluation show that the PPG sensor achieves quite similar input data and assessment results during awake stages. The Fitbit sensor tested often underestimates, with sometimes delayed or doesn't detect a sudden increase in heart rate during sleeping.

AB  - Background: Exercise, light physical activity, and decreased sedentary time all have been associated with health benefits following cancer diagnoses. Commercially available wearable activity trackers may help patients monitor and self-manage their behaviors to achieve these benefits.
   Objectives: This article highlights some advantages and limitations clinicians should be aware of when discussing the use of activity trackers with cancer survivors.
   Methods: Limited research has assessed the accuracy of commercially available activity trackers compared to research-grade devices. Because most devices use confidential, proprietary algorithms to convert accelerometry data to meaningful output like total steps, assessing whether these algorithms account for differences in gait abnormalities, functional limitations, and different body morphologies can be difficult. Quantification of sedentary behaviors and light physical activities present additional challenges.
   Findings: The global market for activity trackers is growing, which presents clinicians with a tremendous opportunity to incorporate these devices into clinical practice as tools to promote activity. This article highlights important considerations about tracker accuracy and usage by cancer survivors.

AB  - Cigarette smoking is a serious risk factor for cancer, cardiovascular, and pulmonary diseases. Current methods of monitoring of cigarette smoking habits rely on various forms of self-report that are prone to errors and under reporting. This paper presents a first step in the development of a methodology for accurate and objective assessment of smoking using noninvasive wearable sensors (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) by demonstrating feasibility of automatic recognition of smoke inhalations from signals arising from continuous monitoring of breathing and hand-to-mouth gestures by support vector machine classifiers. The performance of subject-dependent (individually calibrated) models was compared to performance of subject-independent (group) classification models. The models were trained and validated on a dataset collected from 20 subjects performing 12 different activities representative of everyday living (total duration 19.5 h or 21411 breath cycles). Precision and recall were used as the accuracy metrics. Group models obtained 87% and 80% of average precision and recall, respectively. Individual models resulted in 90% of average precision and recall, indicating a significant presence of individual traits in signal patterns. These results suggest the feasibility of monitoring cigarette smoking by means of a wearable and noninvasive sensor system in free living conditions.

AB  - Background: Caregiver burden associated with dementia-related agitation is one of the most common reasons for a community-dwelling person living with dementia to transition to a care facility. The Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention (BESI) for the Dementia Caregiver Empowerment system uses sensing technology, smartwatches, tablets, and data analytics to detect and predict agitation in persons living with dementia and to provide just-in-time notifications and dyad-specific intervention recommendations to caregivers. The BESI system has shown that there is a valid relationship between dementia-related agitation and environmental factors and that caregivers prefer a home-based monitoring system.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to obtain input from caregivers of persons living with dementia on the value, usability, and acceptability of the BESI system in the home setting and obtain their insights and recommendations for the next stage of system development.
   Methods: A descriptive qualitative design with thematic analysis was used to analyze 10 semistructured interviews with caregivers. The interviews comprised 16 questions, with an 80% (128/160) response rate.
   Results: Postdeployment caregiver feedback about the BESI system and the overall experience were generally positive. Caregivers acknowledged the acceptability of the system by noting the ease of use and saw the system as a fit for them. Functionality issues such as timeliness in agitation notification and simplicity in the selection of agitation descriptors on the tablet interface were identified, and caregivers indicated a desire for more word options to describe agitation behaviors. Agitation intervention suggestions were well received by the caregivers, and the resulting decrease in the number and severity of agitation events helped confirm that the BESI system has good value and acceptability. Thematic analysis suggested several subjective experiences and yielded the themes of usefulness and helpfulness.
   Conclusions: This study determined preferences for assessing caregiver strain and burden, explored caregiver acceptance of the technology system (in-home sensors, actigraph or smart watch technology, and tablet devices), discerned caregiver insights on the burden and stress of caring for persons living with dementia experiencing agitation in dementia, and solicited caregiver input and recommendations for system changes. The themes of usefulness and helpfulness support the use of caregiver knowledge and experience to inform further development of the technology.

AB  - The influence of applied machine learning in our day-to-day life has seen significant improvement over the last few years. The use of machine learning in Artificial Intelligence to predict various aspects of human life has helped industries in knowledge discovery, to draw inferences and to ultimately increase the business aspects. In healthcare industry, when different machines which monitor various health parameters are increasingly getting connected, it is important to process the information and draw inferences which could be very helpful and easy for the doctors to prescribe medicines and to give advice on lifestyle changes. In this paper, disease progression of Diabetes Mellitus of 442 patients is analyzed in terms of various health parameters along with six related blood serum measurements. Here, optimized stacking method is used to perform both regression and classification. In regression, the quantitative measurement of disease progression is predicted where as in classification, the disease progression is classified into high progression or low progression category. In both cases, certain base models are chosen and the accuracy score of these base models are compared with the score of optimized stacking based ensemble model.Optimized Stacking has shown promising results in comparison with the individual methods. The method is also tested on standard datasets. The result validation is performed using a large dataset with 22 features and 70,692 records, which is used to predict the diabetic information of patients. It was found that the technique has performed well with all the datasets.This method can be used as a data analysis backbone of healthcare based IoT systems for predicting diabetic progression as well as for any other related applications.

AB  - We present a case series of three febrile episodes in neutropenic pediatric cancer patients who wore a Food and Drug Administration approved high-frequency temperature monitoring (HFTM) wearable device (WD) at home. The WD detected fever events when temperature monitoring by thermometer did not detect fever or was not feasible to perform. Two of the episodes were associated with bloodstream infections and the WD detected fevers 5 and 12 h prior to fevers detected by thermometer, triggering earlier medical evaluation and more prompt administration of antibiotics. These observations provide a basis for future investigation of home-based HFTM to improve infection-related outcomes in pediatric oncology.

AB  - The recent advancements in Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) transformed the conventional healthcare system into smart healthcare. By incorporating key technologies such as IoT and AI, medical services can be improved. The convergence of IoT and AI offers different opportunities in healthcare sector. In this view, the current research article presents a new AI and IoT convergence-based disease diagnosis model for smart healthcare system. The major goal of this article is to design a disease diagnosis model for heart disease and diabetes using AI and IoT convergence techniques. The presented model encompasses different stages namely, data acquisition, preprocessing, classification, and parameter tuning. IoT devices such as wearables and sensors permit seamless data collection while AI techniques utilize the data in disease diagnosis. The proposed method uses Crow Search Optimization algorithm-based Cascaded Long Short Term Memory (CSO-CLSTM) model for disease diagnosis. In order to achieve better classification of the medical data, CSO is applied to tune both 'weights' and 'bias' parameters of CLSTM model. Besides, isolation Forest (iForest) technique is employed in this research work to remove the outliers. The application of CSO helps in considerable improvement in the diagnostic outcomes of CLSTM model. The performance of CSO-LSTM model was validated using healthcare data. During the experimentation, the presented CSO-LSTM model accomplished the maximum accuracies of 96.16% and 97.26% in diagnosing heart disease and diabetes respectively. Therefore, the proposed CSO-LSTM model can be employed as an appropriate disease diagnosis tool for smart healthcare systems.

AB  - BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of ischemic stroke in asymptomatic individuals and may be the underlying cause of many cryptogenic strokes. We aimed to test the usefulness of candidate blood-biomarkers related to AF pathophysiology in two prospective cohorts representative of those populations. MethodsTwo hundred seventy-four subjects aged 65-75 years with hypertension and diabetes from the AFRICAT cohort, and 218 cryptogenic stroke patients aged >55 years from the CRYPTO-AF cohort were analyzed. AF was assessed by 4 weeks of monitoring with a wearable Holter device (NuuboTM (TM)). Blood was collected immediately before monitoring started. 10 candidate biomarkers were measured by automated immunoassays (Roche, Penzberg) in the plasma of all patients. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were performed in each cohort separately. ResultsAtrial fibrillation detection rate was 12.4% (AFRICAT cohort) and 22.9% (CRYPTO-AF cohort). 4 biomarkers were significantly increased in asymptomatic individuals with AF [Troponin-T, Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Endocan, and total N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)] and 7 biomarkers showed significantly higher concentrations in cryptogenic stroke patients with AF detection [growth differentiation factor 15, interleukin 6, Troponin-T, Ang-2, Bone morphogenic protein 10, Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK-3), and total NT-proBNP]. The models including Ang-2 and total NT-proBNP [AUC 0.764 (0.665-0.863)], and Ang-2 and DKK-3 [AUC = 0.733 (0.654-0.813)], together with age and sex, showed the best performance to detect AF in high-risk asymptomatic individuals, and in cryptogenic stroke patients, respectively. ConclusionBlood-biomarkers, in particular, total NT-proBNP, DKK-3, and Ang-2, were associated with AF reflecting two mechanistically different pathways involved in AF pathophysiology (AF stretch and vascular changes). The combination of these biomarkers could be useful in AF screening strategies in the primary care setting and also for searching AF after cryptogenic stroke.

AB  - Background: Circadian and sleep disturbances are associated with increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Wearable activity trackers could provide a new approach in diagnosis and prevention.
   Objective: To evaluate sleep and circadian rhythm parameters, through wearable activity trackers, in MCI and AD patients as compared to controls, focusing on sex dissimilarities.
   Methods: Based on minute level data from consumer wearable devices, we analyzed actigraphic sleep parameters by applying an electromedical type I registered algorithm, and the corresponding circadian variables in 158 subjects: 86 females and 72 males (42 AD, 28 MCI, and 88 controls). Moreover, we used a confusion-matrix chart method to assess accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of two decision-tree models based on actigraphic data in predicting disease or health status.
   Results: Wake after sleep onset (WASO) was higher (p < 0.001) and sleep efficiency (SE) lower (p = 0.003) in MCI, and Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) was lower in AD patients compared to controls (p = 0.004). SE was lower in male AD compared to female AD (p = 0.038) and SRI lower in male AD compared to male controls (p = 0.008), male MCI (p = 0.047), but also female AD subjects (p = 0.046). Mesor was significantly lower in males in the overall population. Age reduced the dissimilarities for WASO and SE but demonstrated sex differences for amplitude (p = 0.009) in the overall population, controls (p = 0.005), and AD subjects (p = 0.034). The confusion-matrices showed good predictive power of actigraphic data.
   Conclusion: Actigraphic data could help identify disease or health status. Sex (possibly gender) differences could impact on neurodegeneration and disease trajectory with potential clinical applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR), individuals present with significant knee power absorption deficits during deceleration of dynamic tasks. An inability to quantify these deficits clinically may underlie their persistence. Recent studies suggest that segment angular velocities measured with wearable inertial sensors have the potential to provide valuable information about knee power during a single-limb loading (SLL) task. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these measures and procedures needs to be established before translating this information to clinical practice.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of using inertial-sensor thigh angular velocities to detect asymmetrical knee loading during a dynamic SLL task in individuals following ACLR.
   METHODS: In this controlled laboratory study, 21 individuals following ACLR performed 3 trials of SLL on each limb. Sagittal plane peak knee power absorption was calculated for each limb (reconstructed and nonsurgical) during deceleration. Between-limb ratios (reconstructed/nonsurgi-cal limb) were calculated for knee power using marker-based motion analysis, and thigh angular velocity was extracted from inertial sensors. Sensitivity and specificity of thigh angular velocity ratios in diagnosing asymmetrical knee loading (knee power deficits greater than 15%) were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.
   RESULTS: Thigh angular velocity ratios detected asymmetrical knee loading when performing SLL with high sensitivity (81%) and specificity (100%).
   CONCLUSION: These findings support the use of cost- effective wearable sensors to objectively quantify movement clinically in this population of individuals following ACLR. This study establishes procedures for the clinical quantification of dynamic knee loading deficits.

AB  - Background: Physical activity is positively associated with survival and quality of life among breast cancer survivors. Despite these benefits, the majority of breast cancer survivors are insufficiently active. The potential health benefits of reducing sedentary behaviour (sitting time) in this population have not been extensively investigated. The ACTIVATE Trial will evaluate the efficacy of an intervention that combines wearable technology (the Garmin Vivofit2 (R)) with traditional behavioural change approaches to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviour performed by breast cancer survivors.
   Methods/design: This randomised controlled trial includes inactive, postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who have completed their primary treatment. Participants are randomly assigned to the primary intervention group (Garmin Vivofit2 (R); behavioural feedback and goal setting session; and, five telephone-delivered health coaching sessions) or to the wait-list control group. The primary intervention is delivered over a 12-week period. The second 12-week period comprises a maintenance phase for the primary intervention group, and an abridged intervention (Garmin Vivofit2 (R) only) for the wait-list control group. Moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviour are assessed by accelerometry at baseline (T1), end of intervention (T2), and end of maintenance phase (T3).
   Discussion: The ACTIVATE Trial is one of the first studies to incorporate wearable technology into an intervention for cancer survivors. If the use of wearable technology (in combination with behaviour change strategies, or alone) proves efficacious, it may become an inexpensive and sustainable addition to the health promotion strategies available to health care providers in the cancer survivorship context.

AB  - Background The benefits of an active lifestyle after a breast cancer diagnosis are well recognized, but the majority of survivors are insufficiently active. The ACTIVATE Trial examined the efficacy of an intervention (use of the Garmin Vivofit 2 activity monitor coupled with a behavioral feedback and goal-setting session and 5 telephone-delivered health coaching sessions) to increase moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and reduce sedentary behavior in breast cancer survivors. Methods This randomized controlled trial recruited 83 inactive, postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I-III breast cancer who had completed primary treatment. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or to the control group, and the intervention was delivered over a 12-week period. MVPA and sedentary behavior were measured with Actigraph and activPAL accelerometers at baseline (T1) and at the end of the intervention (T2). Results Retention in the trial was high, with 80 (96%) of participants completing T2 data collection. At T2, there was a significant between-group difference in MVPA (69 min/wk; 95% CI = 22-116) favoring the intervention group. The trial resulted in a statistically significant decrease in both total sitting time and prolonged bouts (>= 20 min) of sitting, with between-group reductions of 37 min/d (95% CI = -72 to -2) and 42 min/d (95% CI = -83 to -2), respectively, favoring the intervention group. Conclusion Results from the ACTIVATE Trial suggest that the use of wearable technology presents an inexpensive and scalable opportunity to facilitate more active lifestyles for cancer survivors. Whether or not such wearable technology-based interventions can create sustainable behavioral change should be the subject of future research.

AB  - Softwares are involved in all aspects of healthcare, such as booking appointments to software systems that are used for treatment and care of patients. Many vendors and consultants develop high quality software healthcare systems such as hospital management systems, medical electronic systems, and middle-ware softwares in medical devices. Internet of Things (IoT) medical devices are gaining attention and facilitate the people with new technology. The health condition of the patients are monitored by the IoT devices using sensors, specifically brain diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson's, and Traumatic brain injury. Embedded software is present in IoT medical devices and the complexity of software increases day-by-day with the increase in the number and complexity of bugs in the devices. Bugs present in IoT medical devices can have severe consequences such as inaccurate records, circulatory suffering, and death in some cases along with delay in handling patients. There is a need to predict the impact of bugs (severe or nonsevere), especially in case of loT medical devices due to their critical nature. This research proposes a hybrid bug severity prediction model using convolution neural network (CNN) and Harris Hawk optimization (HHO) based on an optimized hyperparameter of CNN with HHO. The dataset is created, that consists of the bugs present in healthcare systems and IoT medical devices, which is used for evaluation of the proposed model. A preprocessing technique on textual dataset is applied along with a feature extraction technique for CNN embedding layer. In H HO, we define the hyperparameter values of "Batch Size, Learning Rate, Activation Function, Optimizer Parameters, and Kernel Initializers," before training the model. Hybrid model CNN-HHO is applied, and a 10-fold cross validation is performed for evaluation. Results indicate an accuracy of 96.21% with the proposed model.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a new complete wearable system for detecting breast tumors based on fully textile antenna-based sensors. The proposed sensor is compact and fully made of textiles so that it fits conformably and comfortably on the breasts with dimensions of 24 x 45 x 0.17 mm(3) on a cotton substrate. The proposed antenna sensor is fed with a coplanar waveguide feed for easy integration with other systems. It realizes impedance bandwidth from 1.6 GHz up to 10 GHz at vertical bar S-11 vertical bar <= -6 dB (VSWR <= 3) and from 1.8 to 2.4 GHz and from 4 up to 10 GHz at vertical bar S-11 vertical bar <= -10 dB (VSWR <= 2). The proposed sensor acquires a low specific absorption rate (SAR) of 0.55 W/kg and 0.25 W/kg at 1g and 10 g, respectively, at 25 dBm power level over the operating band. Furthermore, the proposed system utilizes machine-learning algorithms (MLA) to differentiate between malignant tumor and benign breast tissues. Simulation examples have been recorded to verify and validate machine-learning algorithms in detecting tumors at different sizes of 10 mm and 20 mm, respectively. The classification accuracy reached 100% on the tested dataset when considering |S-21| parameter features. The proposed system is vision as a "Smart Bra" that is capable of providing an easy interface for women who require continuous breast monitoring in the comfort of their homes.

AB  - Background: Exposure to thousands of head and body impacts during a career in contact and collision sports may contribute to current or later life issues related to brain health. Wearable technology enables the measurement of impact exposure. The validation of impact detection is required for accurate exposure monitoring. In this study, we present a method of automatic identification (classification) of head and body impacts using an instrumented mouthguard, video-verified impacts, and machine-learning algorithms.Methods: Time series data were collected via the Nexus A9 mouthguard from 60 elite level men (mean age = 26.33; SD = 3.79) and four women (mean age = 25.50; SD = 5.91) from the Australian Rules Football players from eight clubs, participating in 119 games during the 2020 season. Ground truth data labeling on the captures used in this machine learning study was performed through the analysis of game footage by two expert video reviewers using SportCode and Catapult Vision. The visual labeling process occurred independently of the mouthguard time series data. True positive captures (captures where the reviewer directly observed contact between the mouthguard wearer and another player, the ball, or the ground) were defined as hits. Spectral and convolutional kernel based features were extracted from time series data. Performances of untuned classification algorithms from scikit-learn in addition to XGBoost were assessed to select the best performing baseline method for tuning.Results: Based on performance, XGBoost was selected as the classifier algorithm for tuning. A total of 13,712 video verified captures were collected and used to train and validate the classifier. True positive detection ranged from 94.67% in the Test set to 100% in the hold out set. True negatives ranged from 95.65 to 96.83% in the test and rest sets, respectively.Discussion and conclusion: This study suggests the potential for high performing impact classification models to be used for Australian Rules Football and highlights the importance of frequencies <150 Hz for the identification of these impacts.

AB  - IntroductionAdvances in mobile computing platforms and the rapid development of wearable devices have made possible the continuous monitoring of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and their daily activities. Such rich data can reveal more subtle changes in patients' behavioral and physiological characteristics, providing new ways to detect MCI anytime, anywhere. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and validity of digital cognitive tests and physiological sensors applied to MCI assessment. MethodsWe collected photoplethysmography (PPG), electrodermal activity (EDA) and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from 120 participants (61 MCI patients, 59 healthy controls) during rest and cognitive testing. The features extracted from these physiological signals involved the time domain, frequency domain, time-frequency domain and statistics. Time and score features during the cognitive test are automatically recorded by the system. In addition, selected features of all modalities were classified by tenfold cross-validation using five different classifiers. ResultsThe experimental results showed that the weighted soft voting strategy combining five classifiers achieved the highest classification accuracy (88.9%), precision (89.9%), recall (88.2%), and F1 score (89.0%). Compared to healthy controls, the MCI group typically took longer to recall, draw, and drag. Moreover, during cognitive testing, MCI patients showed lower heart rate variability, higher electrodermal activity values, and stronger brain activity in the alpha and beta bands. DiscussionIt was found that patients' classification performance improved when combining features from multiple modalities compared to using only tablet parameters or physiological features, indicating that our scheme could reveal MCI-related discriminative information. Furthermore, the best classification results on the digital span test across all tasks suggest that MCI patients may have deficits in attention and short-term memory that came to the fore earlier. Finally, integrating tablet cognitive tests and wearable sensors would provide a new direction for creating an easy-to-use and at-home self-check MCI screening tool.

AB  - The enlargement of ventricular volume is a general trend in the elderly, especially in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Multiple susceptibility loci have been reported to have an increased risk for AD and the morphology of brain structures are affected by the variations in the risk loci. Therefore, we hypothesized that genes contributed significantly to the ventricular surface, and the changes of ventricular surface were associated with the impairment of cognitive functions. After the quality controls (QC) and genotyping, a lateral ventricular segmentation method was employed to obtain the surface features of lateral ventricle. We evaluated the influence of 18 selected AD susceptibility loci on both volume and surface morphology across 410 subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Correlations were conducted between radial distance (RD) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) subscales. Only the C allele at the rs744373 loci in BIN1 gene significantly accelerated the atrophy of lateral ventricle, including the anterior horn, body, and temporal horn of left lateral ventricle. No significant effect on lateral ventricle was found at other loci. Our results revealed that most regions of the bilateral ventricular surface were significantly negatively correlated with cognitive scores, particularly in delayed recall. Besides, small areas of surface were negatively correlated with language, orientation, and visuospatial scores. Together, our results indicated that the genetic variation affected the localized areas of lateral ventricular surface, and supported that lateral ventricle was an important brain structure associated with cognition in the elderly.

AB  - Clinical assessment of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in nursing homes is often based on staff member's observations and the use of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version (NPI-NH) instrument. This requires continuous observation of the person with BPSD, and a lot of effort and manual input from the nursing home staff. This article presents the DemaWare@NH monitoring framework system, which complements traditional methods in measuring patterns of behavior, namely sleep and stress, for people with BPSD in nursing homes. The framework relies on ambient and wearable sensors for observing the users and analytics to assess their conditions. In our proof-of-concept scenario, four residents from two nursing homes were equipped with sleep and skin sensors, whose data is retrieved, processed and analyzed by the framework, detecting and highlighting behavioral problems, and providing relevant, accurate information to clinicians on sleep and stress patterns. The results indicate that structured information from sensors can ease and improve the understanding of behavioral patterns, and, as a consequence, the efficiency of care interventions, yielding a positive impact on the quality of the clinical assessment process for people with BPSD in nursing homes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES The WATCH AF (SmartWATCHes for Detection of Atrial Fibrillation) trial compared the diagnostic accuracy to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) by a smartwatch-based algorithm using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals with cardiologists' diagnosis by electrocardiography (ECG).
   BACKGROUND Timely detection of AF is crucial for stroke prevention.
   METHODS In this prospective, 2-center, case-control trial, a PPG pulse wave recording using a commercially available smartwatch was obtained along with Internet-enabled mobile ECG in 672 hospitalized subjects. PPG recordings were analyzed by a novel automated algorithm. Cardiologists' diagnoses were available for 650 subjects, although 142 (21.8%) datasets were not suitable for PPG analysis, among them 101 (15.1%) that were also not interpretable by the automated Internet-enabled mobile ECG algorithm, resulting in a sample size of 508 subjects (mean age 76.4 years, 225 women, 237 with AF) for the main analyses.
   RESULTS For the PPG algorithm, we found a sensitivity of 93.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 89.8% to 96.4%), a specificity of 98.2% (95% CI: 95.8% to 99.4%), and 96.1% accuracy (95% CI: 94.0% to 97.5%) to detect AF.
   CONCLUSIONS The results of the WATCH AF trial suggest that detection of AF using a commercially available smartwatch is in principle feasible, with very high diagnostic accuracy. Applicability of the tested algorithm is currently limited by a high dropout rate as a result of insufficient signal quality. Thus, achieving sufficient signal quality remains challenging, but real-time signal quality checks are expected to improve signal quality. Whether smartwatches may be useful complementary tools for convenient long-term AF screening in selected at-risk patients must be evaluated in larger population-based samples.

AB  - Background: Cognitive frailty (CF), defined as the simultaneous presence of cognitive impairment and physical frailty, is a clinical symptom in early-stage dementia with promise in assessing the risk of dementia. The purpose of this study was to use wearables to determine the most sensitive digital gait biomarkers to identify CF. Methods: Of 121 older adults (age = 78.9 +/- 8.2 years, body mass index = 26.6 +/- 5.5 kg/m(2)) who were evaluated with a comprehensive neurological exam and the Fried frailty criteria, 41 participants (34%) were identified with CF and 80 participants (66%) were identified without CF. Gait performance of participants was assessed under single task (walking without cognitive distraction) and dual task (walking while counting backward from a random number) using a validated wearable platform. Participants walked at habitual speed over a distance of 10 m. A validated algorithm was used to determine steady-state walking. Gait parameters of interest include steady-state gait speed, stride length, gait cycle time, double support, and gait unsteadiness. In addition, speed and stride length were normalized by height. Results: Our results suggest that compared to the group without CF, the CF group had deteriorated gait performances in both single-task and dual-task walking (Cohen's effect size d = 0.42-0.97, p < 0.050). The largest effect size was observed in normalized dual-task gait speed (d = 0.97, p < 0.001). The use of dual-task gait speed improved the area under the curve (AUC) to distinguish CF cases to 0.76 from 0.73 observed for the single-task gait speed. Adding both single-task and dual-task gait speeds did not noticeably change AUC. However, when additional gait parameters such as gait unsteadiness, stride length, and double support were included in the model, AUC was improved to 0.87. Conclusions: This study suggests that gait performances measured by wearable sensors are potential digital biomarkers of CF among older adults. Dual-task gait and other detailed gait metrics provide value for identifying CF above gait speed alone. Future studies need to examine the potential benefits of gait performances for early diagnosis of CF and/or tracking its severity over time.

AB  - The continuous improvements in the area of medical imaging, makes the patient monitoring a crucial concern. The internet of things (IoT) embedded in a medical technologies to collect data from human body through sensors, wireless connectivity etc. The junction of medicine and IT like medical informatics will transform healthcare, curbing cost, make more efficient, and saving lives. Various computerized techniques are implemented in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the application of medical imaging to diagnose the infected regions in the images and videos such as WCE and pathology. The famous stomach infections are ulcer, polyp, and bleeding. Stomach cancer is the most common infection and a leading cause of human deaths worldwide. In the USA, since 2019, a total of 27,510 new cases are reported including 17,230 men and 10,230 women. While the number of deaths is 11,140 consists of 6,800 men and 4,340 women. The manual diagnosis of these stomach infections is a difficult and agitated process therefore it is required to design a fully automated system using AI. In this article, we presented a fully automated system for stomach infection recognition based on deep learning features fusion and selection. In this design, ulcer images are assigned manually and support to a saliency-based method for ulcer detection. Later, pre-trained deep learning model named VGG16 is employing and re-trained using transfer learning. Features of re-trained model are extracted from two consecutive fully connected layers and fused by array-based approach. Besides, the best individuals are selected through the metaheuristic approach name PSO along mean value-based fitness function. The selected individuals are finally recognized through Cubic SVM. The experiments are conducted on Private collected dataset and achieved an accuracy of 98.4%, which is best as compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

AB  - The COVID-19 disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become one of the worst global pandemics of the century. Wearable devices are well suited for continuously measuring heart rate. Here we show that the Resting Heart Rate is modified for several weeks following a COVID-19 infection. The Resting Heart Rate shows 3 phases: 1) elevated during symptom onset, with average peak increases relative to the baseline of 1.8% (3.4%) for females (males), 2) decrease thereafter, reaching a minimum on average asymptotic to 13 days after symptom onset, and 3) subsequent increase, reaching a second peak on average asymptotic to 28 days from symptom onset, before falling back to the baseline asymptotic to 112 days from symptom onset. All estimates vary with disease severity (1) .

AB  - Dementia contributes to the development of pressure injuries (PrIs). PURPOSE: This study describes the real-time body positions of 2 nursing home (NH) residents, residing in the United States and living with dementia, to inform development of PrI prevention strategies tailored to individual risk profiles. METHODS: As part of a larger study, eligible residents were fitted with a triaxial accelerometer sensor placed on the anterior chest to monitor body positions 24-hours daily through a 4-week monitoring period. The current study used an observational, prospective design during routine repositioning events for 2 residents. A convenience sample of 2 residents from a single NH wing who were considered moderately at risk for PrI development (Braden Scale score 13-14) with a Brief Interview for Mental Status score in the severely impaired range were selected based on nursing staff recommendation. RESULTS: Sensor data showed that both residents, although "chairfast" according to the Braden Scale, spent <5% in an upright position and the great majority of time reclining at an angle <50%. One (1) resident demonstrated a persistent side preference. CONCLUSIONS: Wearable sensors are not a long-term solution for protecting those with dementia from PrI formation but do provide a crude picture of overall body positions throughout the 24-hour day that may inform individualized PrI prevention strategies. Studies including large samples of NH residents living with dementia are warranted.

AB  - In clinical conditions, polysomnography (PSG) is regarded as the "golden standard" for detecting sleep disease and offering a reference of objective sleep quality. For healthy adults, scores from sleep questionnaires are more reliable than other methods in obtaining knowledge of subjective sleep quality. In practice, the need to simplify PSG to obtain subjective sleep quality by recording a few channels of physiological signals such as single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) signal is still very urgent. This study provided a two-step method to differentiate sleep quality into "good sleep" and "poor sleep" based on the single-lead wearable cardiac cycle data, with the comparison of the subjective sleep questionnaire score. First, heart rate variability (HRV) features and ECG-derived respiration features were extracted to construct a sleep staging model (wakefulness (W), rapid eye movement (REM), light sleep (N1&N2) and deep sleep (N3)) using the multi-classifier fusion method. Then, features extracted from the sleep staging results were used to construct a sleep quality evaluation model, i.e., classifying the sleep quality as good and poor. The accuracy of the sleep staging model, tested on the international public database, was 0.661 and 0.659 in Cardiology Challenge 2018 training database and Sleep Heart Health Study Visit 1 database, respectively. The accuracy of the sleep quality evaluation model was 0.786 for our recording subjects, with an average F-1-score of 0.771. The proposed sleep staging model and sleep quality evaluation model only requires one channel of wearable cardiac cycle signal. It is very easy to transplant to portable devices, which facilitates daily sleep health monitoring.

AB  - Physical disorders are considered to be the most severe disability in patients with hemiplegia after stroke. Currently, most studies have used motion feature extraction methods and machine learning-based methods to evaluate the functional degree of post stroke in hemiplegic patients. This research collected feature data from patients under diverse experimental conditions and then fed them into different machine learning classifiers. However, few studies have compared which classifiers and experimental condition could achieve more precise assessments in a specific condition. In this paper, we compared the accuracy of four different classifiers in a conservative motion recognition method. A motion sensor was used for monitoring the upper limb action, and four conservative machine learning classifiers, which map the features to Fugl-Meyer scale, were chosen for comparison. Ten post-stroke hemiplegic-simulated subjects performed a group of predefined actions, and these motion data were used to generate a group of features reflecting the information of each predefined action. We input the features into four classifiers to generate corresponding classifiers. With the Support Vector Machine classifier, prediction accuracy at 97.79% was achieved in the experiment data, which outperformed previous reports. In conclusion, Support Vector Machines perform better than the other three classifiers in the assessment of the degree of post-stroke hemiplegics. It is encouraging that results have been generated with the proposed assessment method in this exploratory study.

AB  - With the prevalence of cognitive diseases, the health industry is facing newer challenges since cognitive health deteriorates gradually over time, and clear signs and symptoms appear when it is too late. Smart homes and the IoT (Internet of Things) have given hope to the health industry to monitor and manage the elderly and the less-abled in the comfort of their homes. Smart homes have been most influential in detecting and managing cognitive diseases like dementia. They can give a comprehensive view of the ADL (Activities of Daily Living) of dementia patients. ADLs are categorized as activities of daily life and complex interwoven activities. First signs of cognitive decline appear when a cognitively impaired individual tries to perform complex activities involving planning, analyzing, calculating, and decision making. Therefore, we analyze individuals' performance while performing complex activities as opposed to Simple ADL. Artificial Intelligence has been one of health-care's most promising techniques for prediction and diagnosis. When applied to ADL data, machine learning and deep learning algorithms can conveniently and accurately analyze activity patterns and predict the first signs of cognitive decline. Our proposed work uses machine and deep learning classifiers to classify dementia and healthy individuals by analyzing complex interwoven activity data. We use the subset of the CASAS (Centre of Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems) dataset for eight complex activities performed by 179 individuals in a smart home setting. decision tree, Naive Bayes, support vector, multilayer perceptron classifiers, and deep neural networks have been used for classification. Their results and performances are compared to determine the best classifier. It is observed that deep neural networks and multilayer perceptron show the best results for classifying dementia vs. healthy individuals when evaluating their complex interwoven activities.

AB  - The time-shifting elements and high between individual changeability make early forecast of a seizure express a difficult errand. Numerous examinations have demonstrated that EEG signals do have profitable data that if effectively broke down, could help in the expectation of seizures in epileptic patients before their event. A few numerical changes have been broke down for its connection with seizure beginning forecast and a progression of analyses were done to ensure their qualities. New calculations are exhibited to help elucidate, screen, and cross-approve the order of EEG signs to foresee the ictal (for example seizure) states, explicitly the preictal, interictal, and postictal states in the mind. These new strategies show promising outcomes in distinguishing the nearness of a preictal stage before the ictal state. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are playing major role in Diagnosis and Predicting the diseases, EEG signal were recorded with 16 channel system from brain scalp and stored in system. From recorded database seizure levels were analyzed from each channel by articrafting with ICA and PCA algorithms and processed through Band pass filter to identify the Delta, Theta, Alpha and Beta levels. After collecting the brain signals from each channel they were bided with FFT to get the data in time domain series. A machine learning model is developed using python programming by sampling on obtained EEG data, sampled data is trained on to the system. Machine Learning algorithms were applied to the data to accuracy and predict the accuracy on developed model neural network is applied to identify the True-False values. The analyzed data is integrated with IOT framework to Diagnosis the Cerebral Palsy patient remotely. Remote monitoring system for the persons with Intellectual disabilities and update the health status to care takers time to time while they are at work. It's also reduces the patient work load by checking his details staying at home rather going to a hospital. If system identifies any changes in patient heart rate, brain signals, body temperature, the system alerts the doctor and respective relatives about patient's status over IOT and also stores the patient details in the cloud.

AB  - BackgroundBlood pressure diseases have increasingly been identified as among the main factors threatening human health. How to accurately and conveniently measure blood pressure is the key to the implementation of effective prevention and control measures for blood pressure diseases. Traditional blood pressure measurement methods exhibit many inherent disadvantages, for example, the time needed for each measurement is difficult to determine, continuous measurement causes discomfort, and the measurement process is relatively cumbersome. Wearable devices that enable continuous measurement of blood pressure provide new opportunities and hopes. Although machine learning methods for blood pressure prediction have been studied, the accuracy of the results does not satisfy the needs of practical applications.ResultsThis paper proposes an efficient blood pressure prediction method based on the support vector machine regression (SVR) algorithm to solve the key gap between the need for continuous measurement for prophylaxis and the lack of an effective method for continuous measurement. The results of the algorithm were compared with those obtained from two classical machine learning algorithms, i.e., linear regression (LinearR), back propagation neural network (BP), with respect to six evaluation indexes (accuracy, pass rate, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared coefficient of determination (R-2) and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). The experimental results showed that the SVR model can accurately and effectively predict blood pressure.ConclusionThe multi-feature joint training and predicting techniques in machine learning can potentially complement and greatly improve the accuracy of traditional blood pressure measurement, resulting in better disease classification and more accurate clinical judgements.

AB  - The social internet of things (SIoT) facilitates numerous networking services and novel applications for the IoT, making it more productive and powerful. The state-of-the-art machine learning architectures often face different challenges when processing big data such as increased memory volume, increased training time, and higher computational costs. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for big data classification. Initially, an adaptive filter removes unwanted data and noises. The dimensionality of the filter data is then reduced via the Hadoop map reducer. After that, the battle royale optimization (BRO) algorithm is applied for feature selection. The optimal feature selection process performed by the BRO algorithm improves the accuracy and performance of the proposed fuzzy optimal deep convolutional neural network (FO-DCNN). The FO-DCNN model is formed by integrating the fuzzy-based remora optimization (F-RO) algorithm and deep CNN architecture for robust SIoT data classification. When evaluated using the Twitter, Rotten tomato, skin disease, diabetes, and hepatitis datasets, the proposed model offers improvements in terms of classification accuracy, memory consumption, and computational time.

AB  - In this work, a non-invasive diabetes mellitus detection system is proposed based on the wristband photoplethysmography (PPG) signal and basic physiological parameters (PhyP) to enable easy detection of diabetes mellitus (DM). A dataset of 217 participants with diabetes, prediabetes and normal conditions is used to develop the system. The Mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) extracted from 5s PPG signal segments and the PhyP are used as input for the machine learning algorithms. The K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, random forest and extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) classifiers are used for classification. In addition, a hybrid feature selection method (Hybrid FS) is proposed to reduce the size of the input data. The Hybrid FS-based XGBoost system achieves a high accuracy of 99.93 % for non-invasive diabetes detection with fewer features and less computational effort. The analysis suggests that the PPG signal from a wearable sensor is a good alternative for simple non-invasive blood glucose measurements in routine applications.

A series of studies using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and other tests of dementia have attempted to prevent motor vehicle collisions by identifying as early as possible older drivers who may be unable to maintain their driving performance. Further, the performance of older drivers may deteriorate even if they do not have a diagnosis of dementia. Therefore we focused on the relationship between cognitive functioning assessed by the MMSE and diagnosis of leukoaraiosis (LA), or changes in the cerebral white matter, with different aspects of driving behavior resulting from aging. Qualified driving instructors evaluated participants' driving behaviors on an outdoor driving course at a driving school. Visual search duration and angle at intersections were obtained by wearable wireless sensors. Vehicle speed and minimum vehicle speed were recorded from vehicle speed pulse signals. Duration of signaling and visual searches at unsignalized intersections were recorded using an in-vehicle camera. We assessed instructors' evaluations and the scores on two instruments to evaluate the effects of MMSE scores and the grade of LA on driving performance were verified. The results suggest that lower MMSE scores and higher LA grade can predict some aspects of poor driving performance in older drivers before they experience dementia or an evident decline in cognitive functioning. Based on these results, we discuss countermeasures that may prevent motor vehicle collisions involving older drivers. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The use of information technology and technological medical devices has contributed significantly to the transformation of healthcare. Despite that, many problems have arisen in diagnosing or predicting diseases, either as a result of human errors or lack of accuracy of measurements. Therefore, this paper aims to provide an integrated health monitoring system to measure vital parameters and diagnose or predict disease. Through this work, the percentage of various gases in the blood through breathing is determined, vital parameters are measured and their effect on feelings is analyzed. A supervised learning model is configured to predict and diagnose based on biometric measurements. All results were compared with the results of the Omron device as a reference device. The results proved that the proposed design overcame many problems as it contributed to expanding the database of vital parameters and providing analysis on the effect of emotions on vital indicators. The accuracy of the measurements also reached 98.8% and the accuracy of diagnosing COVID-19 was 64%. The work also presents a user interface model for clinicians as well as for smartphones using the Internet of things.

AB  - Recently, a wide variety of real-world problems are solved via cloud computing, deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These methodologies are concerned with different areas like smart cities, agriculture, transportation systems, and healthcare systems. The existing researchers focused on the health care monitoring application along with IoT and cloud computing. It met several shortcomings in case of computational complexity, cost, time, and improper health care data storage and so forth. To overcome these challenges, the novel IoT-enabled secure healthcare monitoring model is proposed in this study. At first, several sensors are deployed in the human body thereby collecting patients' data with respect to vital parameters like body temperature deviation. The patient's health record dataset consists of 10 attributes namely phone numbers, marital status, address, age, name, heartbeat rate, oxygen level, smoking, temperature, and blood pressure. The data size reduction and normalization are performed in the IoT medical sensor dataset which contains the redundant or irrelevant attributes that are eliminated during pre-processing. The artificial hummingbird (AHB) algorithm-based convolutional neural network (AHB-CNN) model performs both feature extraction and classification of cancer disease. The AHB-CNN model classifies whether the patient is prone to cancer or not based on the sensor input collected. The received results are then sent to the hospital management for analysis. The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption method is mostly used in this study due to the major benefits it gives in terms of asymmetric encryption, ease of use, simpler deployment, and high security associated with factoring large prime numbers. A modified RSA algorithm is used in this article which uses the double encryption-decryption process and "n" prime numbers to enhance the security of the conventional RSA algorithm. The data is always encrypted during transit before being stored in the cloud or for further processing. Depending upon the experimental consequences, the proposed method established superior performances compared to other state-of-art techniques.

AB  - There is a growing research interest in wireless non-invasive solutions for core temperature estimation and their application in clinical settings. This study aimed to investigate the use of a novel wireless non-invasive heat flux-based thermometer in acute stroke patients admitted to a stroke unit and compare the measurements with the currently used infrared (IR) tympanic temperature readings. The study encompassed 30 acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent continuous measurement (Tcore) with the novel wearable non-invasive CORE device. Paired measurements of Tcore and tympanic temperature (Ttym) by using a standard IR-device were performed 3-5 times/day, yielding a total of 305 measurements. The predicted core temperatures (Tcore) were significantly correlated with Ttym (r = 0.89, p < 0.001). The comparison of the Tcore and Ttym measurements by Bland-Altman analysis showed a good agreement between them, with a low mean difference of 0.11 +/- 0.34 degrees C, and no proportional bias was observed (B = -0.003, p = 0.923). The Tcore measurements correctly predicted the presence or absence of Ttym hyperthermia or fever in 94.1% and 97.4% of cases, respectively. Temperature monitoring with a novel wireless non-invasive heat flux-based thermometer could be a reliable alternative to the Ttym method for assessing core temperature in acute ischemic stroke patients.

AB  - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an important cardiac rhythm disorder, which if left untreated can lead to serious complications such as a stroke. AF can remain asymptomatic, and it can progressively worsen over time; it is thus a disorder that would benefit from detection and continuous monitoring with a wearable sensor. We develop an AF detection algorithm, deploy it on a smartwatch, and prospectively and comprehensively validate its performance on a real-world population that included patients diagnosed with AF. The algorithm showed a sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 97.4% over every 5-minute segment of PPG evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce novel algorithm blocks and system designs to increase the time of coverage and monitor for AF even during periods of motion noise and other artifacts that would be encountered in daily-living scenarios. An average of 67.8% of the entire duration the patients wore the smartwatch produced a valid decision. Finally, we present the ability of our algorithm to function throughout the day and estimate the AF burden, a first-of-this-kind measure using a wearable sensor, showing 98% correlation with the ground truth and an average error of 6.2%.

AB  - Numerous studies have reported that micro RNAs (miRNAs) play pivotal roles in disease pathogenesis based on the deregulation of the expressions of target messenger RNAs. Therefore, the identification of disease-related miRNAs is of great significance in understanding human complex diseases, which can also provide insight into the design of novel prognostic markers and disease therapies. Considering the time and cost involved in wet experiments, most recent works have focused on the effective and feasible modeling of computational frameworks to uncover miRNA-disease associations. In this study, we propose a novel framework called node2vec-based neural collaborative filtering for predicting miRNA-disease association (NCMD) based on deep neural networks. Initially, NCMD exploits Node2vec to learn low-dimensional vector representations of miRNAs and diseases. Next, it utilizes a deep learning framework that combines the linear ability of generalized matrix factorization and nonlinear ability of a multilayer perceptron. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the comparable performance of NCMD relative to the state-of-the-art methods according to statistical measures. In addition, case studies on breast cancer, lung cancer and pancreatic cancer validate the effectiveness of NCMD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of modeling a neural collaborative-filtering-based approach for discovering novel miRNA-disease associations.

AB  - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is one of the main under-diagnosed sleep disorder. It is an aggravating factor for several serious cardiovascular diseases, including stroke. There is, however, a lack of medical devices for long-term ambulatory monitoring of OSA since current systems are rather bulky, expensive, intrusive, and cannot be used for long-term monitoring in ambulatory settings. In this paper, we propose a wearable, accurate, and energy efficient system for monitoring obstructive sleep apnea on a long-term basis. As an embedded system for Internet of Things, it reduces the gap between home health-care and professional supervision. Our approach is based on monitoring the patient using a single-channel electrocardiogram signal. We develop an efficient time-domain analysis to meet the stringent resources constraints of embedded systems to compute the sleep apnea score. Our system, for a publicly available database (PhysioNet Apnea-ECG), has a classification accuracy of up to 88.2% for our new online and patient-specific analysis, which takes the distinct profile of each patient into account. While accurate, our approach is also energy efficient and can achieve a battery lifetime of 46 days for continuous screening of OSA.

AB  - Background and Aim: Lifestyle is considered a major determinant of risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We investigated whether daily physical activity (DPA) is associated with beta-cell function (BF) and/or insulin sensitivity (IS) in patients with T2D at the time of diagnosis.
   Methods and Results: In 41 subjects enrolled in the Verona Newly-Diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes Study we assessed: (1) IS, by euglycaemic insulin clamp; (2) BF, estimated by prolonged-OGTT minimal modeling and expressed as derivative and proportional control; (3) DPA and energy expenditure (EE), assessed over 48-h monitoring by a validated wearable armband system.
   Study participants (median [IQR]; age: 62 [53-67] years, BMI: 30.8 [26.5-34.3] Kg m(-2), HbA1c: 6.7 [6.3-7.3]%; 49.7 [45.4-56.3] mmol/mol) were moderately active (footsteps/day: 7773 [5748-10,927]; DPA(>= 3MET): 70 [38-125] min/day), but none of them exercised above 6 metabolic equivalents (MET). EE, expressed as EETOT (total daily-EE) and EE >= 3MET (EE due to DPA(>= 3MET)) were 2398 [2226-2801] and 364 [238-617] Kcal/day, respectively. IS (M-clamp 630 [371-878] mmol/min/m(2)) was positively associated with DPA and EE, independent of age, sex and BMI (p < 0.05). Among the DPA and EE parameters assessed, DPA(>= 3MET) and EETOT were independent predictors of IS in multivariable regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, BMI (R-2 = 16%, R-2 = 19%, respectively; p < 0.01). None of model-derived components of BF was significantly associated with DPA or accompanying EE.
   Conclusions: Our study highlighted moderate levels of DPA and total EE as potential determinants of IS, but not BF, in T2D at the time of diagnosis. Intervention studies are needed to conclusively elucidate the effect of DPA on these features.

AB  - The abnormal conduction of cardiac activity in the lower chamber of the heart (ventricular) can cause cardiac diseases and sometimes leads to sudden death. In this paper, the author proposed the Reservoir Computing (RC) based Echo State Networks (ESNs) for ventricular heartbeat classification based on a single Electrocardiogram (ECG) lead. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards were used to preprocesses the standardized diagnostic tool (ECG signals) based on the interpatient scheme. Despite the extensive efforts and notable experiments that have been done on machine learning techniques for heartbeat classification, ESNs are yet to be considered for heartbeat classification as a is fast, scalable, and reliable approach for real-time scenarios. Our proposed method was especially designed for Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) devices, for instance wearable wireless devices for ECG monitoring or ventricular heart beat detection systems and so on. The experiments were conducted on two public datasets, namely AHA and MIT-BIH-SVDM. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated using the MIT-BIH-AR dataset and it achieved remarkable results. The positive predictive value and sensitivity are 98.98% and 98.98%, respectively for the modified lead II (MLII) and 98.96% and 97.95 for the V1 lead, respectively. However, the experimental results of the state-of-the-art approaches, namely the patient-adaptable method, improved generalization, and the multiview learning approach obtained 92.8%, 87.0%, and 98.0% positive predictive values, respectively. These obtained results of the existing studies exemplify that the performance of this method achieved higher accuracy. We believe that the improved classification accuracy opens up the possibility for implementation of this methodology in Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) devices in order to bring improvements in e-health systems.

AB  - Diabetes is one of the chronic metabolic disorder. Under diabetic condition, blood glucose level should be properly maintained in order to avoid various major diseases. The condition will be worse when it is not controlled at an earlier stage. Even massive heart attack cannot be identified when the patient has been affected by diabetes. Early diagnosis is required for preventing fatal diseases like cardiac problem, asthma, heart attack etc. In the proposed system measurement of glucose level and Prediction/ diagnosis of diabetes is based on the real time low complexity neural network implemented on a wearable device. A larger network is required for the diagnosis which needs to be present far-off in cloud and initiated for diagnosis and classification process of diabetes whenever it is essential. People can be able to manage and monitor the required basic parameters like heart rate, glucose level, lung condition, pressure of blood using the corresponding light weight biosensors in the wearable device designed through telemedicine technology. The quality of the disease diagnosis and Prediction is improved in this way. Using neural network feed forward prediction model in conjugation with back propagation algorithm and given training data, the system predicts whether the patient is prone to diabetes or not. The proposed work was evaluated using physic sensor data from physio net data base and also tested for real time functioning. The Proposed system found to be efficient in accuracy, sensitivity and fast operative.

AB  - The unpredictable nature of epileptic seizures makes it challenging to detect and effectively treat this disorder. The seizures are random, and most epileptic patients experience dangerous physical symptoms during an attack that renders the patient uneasy when conducting their daily tasks. This paper focuses on the generalised type of epilepsy, namely "Grand mal epilepsy Tonic-Clonic (GTC) seizure. The research aims to monitor symptoms of epileptic disease behaviour signals in humans and prevent it at its early stage of illness. To achieve this objective, we used the Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), accelerometer 3-axes for fall detection, and Dallas sensor for body temperature signals monitoring for updating the IoT system. The fuzzy logic algorithm that has been used to assess specified data set of diseased patients' parameters allows the classification into diverse types of seizures such as heart rate, body temperature, muscles spasm and falls. These are used as inputs to obtain the seizure type as an output which is then illustrated graphically on the dashboard of an IoT platform (ThinkSpeak), where abnormal conditions have been used to notify the medical personnel by sending an SMS message through "If This Then That" (IFTTT) technology. A prototype of an epileptic monitoring system has been successfully built and tested. It has an average accuracy of 98.90%, 95.49%, 83.0%, and 87.21% for body temperature, heart rate monitoring, muscle spasm, and fall detection.

TI  - Real-time alerting system for COVID-19 and other stress events using wearable data
T2  - NATURE MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Early detection of infectious diseases is crucial for reducing transmission and facilitating early intervention. In this study, we built a real-time smartwatch-based alerting system that detects aberrant physiological and activity signals (heart rates and steps) associated with the onset of early infection and implemented this system in a prospective study. In a cohort of 3,318 participants, of whom 84 were infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), this system generated alerts for pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in 67 (80%) of the infected individuals. Pre-symptomatic signals were observed at a median of 3 days before symptom onset. Examination of detailed survey responses provided by the participants revealed that other respiratory infections as well as events not associated with infection, such as stress, alcohol consumption and travel, could also trigger alerts, albeit at a much lower mean frequency (1.15 alert days per person compared to 3.42 alert days per person for coronavirus disease 2019 cases). Thus, analysis of smartwatch signals by an online detection algorithm provides advance warning of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a high percentage of cases. This study shows that a real-time alerting system can be used for early detection of infection and other stressors and employed on an open-source platform that is scalable to millions of users.

AB  - Background: Over 30 million people in the United States (over 9%) have been diagnosed with diabetes. About 25% of people with diabetes will experience a diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) in their lifetime. Unresolved DFUs may lead to sepsis and are the leading cause of lower-limb amputations. DFU rates can be reduced by screening patients with diabetes to enable risk-based interventions. Skin temperature assessment has been shown to reduce the risk of foot ulceration. While several tools have been developed to measure plantar temperatures, they only measure temperature once a day or are designed for clinic use only. In this report, wireless sensor-embedded socks designed for daily wear are introduced, which perform continuous temperature monitoring of the feet of persons with diabetes in the home environment. Combined with a mobile app, this wearable device informs the wearer about temperature increases in one foot relative to the other, to facilitate early detection of ulcers and timely intervention.
   Objective: A pilot study was conducted to assess the accuracy of sensors used in daily wear socks, obtain user feedback on how comfortable sensor-embedded socks were for home use, and examine whether observed temperatures correlated with clinical observations.
   Methods: Temperature accuracy of sensors was assessed both prior to incorporation in the socks, as well as in the completed design. The measured temperatures were compared to the reference standard, a high-precision thermostatic water bath in the range 20 degrees C-40 degrees C. A total of 35 patients, 18 years of age and older, with diabetic peripheral neuropathy were enrolled in a single-site study conducted under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. This study evaluated the usability of the sensor-embedded socks and correlated the observed temperatures with clinical findings.
   Results: The temperatures measured by the stand-alone sensors were within 0.2 degrees C of the reference standard. In the sensor-embedded socks, across multiple measurements for each of the six sensors, a high agreement (R-2 = 1) between temperatures measured and the reference standard was observed. Patients reported that the socks were easy to use and comfortable, ranking them at a median score of 9 or 10 for comfort and ease of use on a 10-point scale. Case studies are presented showing that the temperature differences observed between the feet were consistent with clinical observations.
   Conclusions: We report the first use of wireless continuous temperature monitoring for daily wear and home use in patients with diabetes and neuropathy. The wearers found the socks to be no different from standard socks. The temperature studies conducted show that the sensors used in the socks are reliable and accurate at detecting temperature and the findings matched clinical observations. Continuous temperature monitoring is a promising approach as an early warning system for foot ulcers, Charcot foot, and reulceration.

AB  - Quantitative evaluation of motor function is of great demand for monitoring clinical outcome of applied interventions and further guiding the establishment of therapeutic protocol. This study proposes a novel framework for evaluating upper limb motor function based on data fusion from inertial measurement units (IMUs) and surface electromyography (EMG) sensors. With wearable sensors worn on the tested upper limbs, subjects were asked to perform eleven straightforward, specifically designed canonical upper-limb functional tasks. A series of machine learning algorithms were applied to the recorded motion data to produce evaluation indicators, which is able to reflect the level of upper-limb motor function abnormality. Sixteen healthy subjects and eighteen stroke subjects with substantial hemiparesis were recruited in the experiment. The combined IMU and EMG data yielded superior performance over the IMU data alone and the EMG data alone, in terms of decreased normal data variation rate (NDVR) and improved determination coefficient (DC) from a regression analysis between the derived indicator and routine clinical assessment score. Three common unsupervised learning algorithms achieved comparable performance with NDVR around 10% and strong DC around 0.85. By contrast, the use of a supervised algorithm was able to dramatically decrease the NDVR to 6.55%. With the proposed framework, all the produced indicators demonstrated high agreement with the routine clinical assessment scale, indicating their capability of assessing upper-limb motor functions. This study offers a feasible solution to motor function assessment in an objective and quantitative manner, especially suitable for home and community use.

AB  - Background Although past longitudinal research demonstrates that romantic partners affect one another's health outcomes, considerably less is known about how romantic experiences "get under the skin" in everyday life.
   Purpose The current study investigated whether young couples' naturally occurring feelings of closeness to and annoyance with each other during waking hours were associated with their overnight cardiovascular activity.
   Methods Participants were 63 heterosexual young adult dating couples (M-age = 23.07). Using ecological momentary assessments, couples reported their hourly feelings of closeness to and annoyance with their partners across 1 day; subsequent overnight heart rate was captured through wearable electrocardiogram biosensors. Actor-partner interdependence models tested whether individuals' overnight heart rate varied as a function of (a) their own daytime feelings of closeness and annoyance (actor effects) and (b) their partner's daytime feelings of closeness and annoyance (partner effects) while controlling for daytime heart rate.
   Results Although young adults' feelings of romantic closeness and annoyance were unrelated to their own overnight heart rate (i.e., no actor effects), gender-specific partner effects emerged. Young men's nocturnal heart rate was uniquely predicted by their female partner's daytime relationship feelings. When women felt closer to their partners during the day, men exhibited lower overnight heart rate. When women felt more annoyed with their partners during the day, men exhibited heightened overnight heart rate.
   Conclusions The findings illustrate gender-specific links between couple functioning and physiological arousal in the everyday lives of young dating couples, implicating physiological sensitivity to partner experiences as one potential pathway through which relationships affect health.

AB  - Background: To detect an early increase in the inflammatory response might prove to be vital for mitigating the deleterious effects of the disease over time. Case: A 52-year-old obese man with moderate asthma and hypertension, who developed COVID-19 and had moderate symptoms, used a wearable device to record heart rate variability (HRV) during his illness. He had low parasympathetic tone, which decreased daily until it reached almost 2 standard deviations (SD) below normal values at the end of the second week. His sympathetic tone increased from > 3 SD to > 5 SD. Conclusions: These findings suggest an altered modulation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in COVID-19, such that the sympathetic tone is augmented and the parasympathetic tone is reduced. Population norms of COVID-19 infections should be further studied over the short-term and using 24 h HRV measurements.

AB  - Anesthesia assessment is most important during surgery. Anesthesiologists use electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to assess the patient's condition and give appropriate medications. However, it is not easy to interpret the ECG signals. Even physicians with more than 10 years of clinical experience may still misjudge. Therefore, this study uses convolutional neural networks to classify ECG image types to assist in anesthesia assessment. The research uses Internet of Things (IoT) technology to develop ECG signal measurement prototypes. At the same time, it classifies signal types through deep neural networks, divided into QRS widening, sinus rhythm, ST depression, and ST elevation. Three models, ResNet, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, are developed with 50% of the training set and test set. Finally, the accuracy and kappa statistics of ResNet, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet in ECG waveform classification were (0.97, 0.96), (0.96, 0.95), and (0.75, 0.67), respectively. This research shows that it is feasible to measure ECG in real time through IoT and then distinguish four types through deep neural network models. In the future, more types of ECG images will be added, which can improve the real-time classification practicality of the deep model.

AB  - This paper presents wearable sensors for detecting differences in chewing strength while eating foods with different hardness (carrot as a hard, apple as moderate and banana as soft food). Four wearable sensor systems were evaluated. They were: (1) a gas pressure sensor measuring changes in ear pressure proportional to ear canal deformation during chewing, (2) a flexible, curved bend sensor attached to right temple of eyeglass measuring the contraction of the temporalis muscle, (3) a piezoelectric strain sensor placed on the temporalis muscle, and (4) an electromyography sensor with electrodes placed on the temporalis muscle. Data from 15 participants, wearing all four sensors at once were collected. Each participant took and consumed 10 bites of carrot, apple, and banana. The hardness of foods were measured by a food penetrometer. Single-factor ANOVA found a significant effect of food hardness on the standard deviation of signals for all four sensors (P-value <.001). Tukey's multiple comparison test with 5% significance level confirmed that the mean of the standard deviations were significantly different for the provided test foods for all four sensors. Results of this study indicate that the wearable sensors may potentially be used for measuring chewing strength and assessing the food hardness.

AB  - Objective: Optimizing peri-operative fluid management has been shown to improve patient outcomes and the use of stroke volume (SV) measurement has become an accepted tool to guide fluid therapy. The Transesophageal Doppler (TED) is a validated, minimally invasive device that allows clinical assessment of SV. Unfortunately, the use of the TED is restricted to the intra-operative setting in anesthetized patients and requires constant supervision and periodic adjustment for accurate signal quality. However, post-operative fluid management is also vital for improved outcomes. Currently, there is no device regularly used in clinics that can track patient's SV continuously and non-invasively both during and after surgery. Methods: In this paper, we propose the use of a wearable patch mounted on the mid-sternum, which captures the seismocardiogram (SCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals continuously to predict SV in patients undergoing major surgery. In a study of 12 patients, hemodynamic data was recorded simultaneously using the TED and wearable patch. Signal processing and regression techniques were used to derive SV from the signals (SCG and ECG) captured by the wearable patch and compare it to values obtained by the TED. Results: The results showed that the combination of SCG and ECG contains substantial information regarding SV, resulting in a correlation and median absolute error between the predicted and reference SV values of 0.81 and 7.56 mL, respectively. Significance: This work shows promise for the proposed wearable-based methodology to be used as an alternative to TED for continuous patient monitoring and guiding peri-operative fluid management.

AB  - Schizophrenia affects 1% of the world population and is associated with a reduction in life expectancy of 20 years. The increasing prevalence of both consumer technology and clinical-grade wearable technology offers new metrics to guide clinical decision-making remotely and in real time. Herein, recent literature is reviewed to determine the potential utility of wearables in schizophrenia, including their utility in diagnosis, first-episode psychosis, and relapse prevention and their acceptability to patients. Several studies have further confirmed the validity of various devices in their ability to track sleep???an especially useful metric in schizophrenia, as sleep disturbances may be predictive of disease onset or the acute worsening of psychotic symptoms. Through machine learning, wearable-obtained heart rate and motor activity were used to differentiate between controls and patients with schizophrenia. Wearables can capture the autonomic dysregulation that has been detected when patients are actively experiencing paranoia, hallucinations, or delusions. Multiple platforms are currently being researched, such as Health Outcomes Through Positive Engagement and Self-Empowerment, Mobile Therapeutic Attention for Treatment-Resistant Schizophrenia, and Sleepsight, that may ultimately link patient data to clinicians. The future is bright for wearables in schizophrenia, as the recent literature exemplifies their potential to offer real-time insights to guide diagnosis and management.

AB  - In this study, we examined the uncertainty and local instability of motor function for cognitive impairment screening using a previously validated upper-extremity function (UEF). This approach was established based upon the fact that elders with an impaired executive function have trouble in the simultaneous execution of a motor and a cognitive task (dual-tasking). Older adults aged 65 years and older were recruited and stratified into 1) cognitive normal (CN), 2) amnestic MCI of the Alzheimer's type (aMCI), and 3) early-stage Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Participants performed normal-paced repetitive elbow flexion without counting and while counting backward by ones and threes. The influence of cognitive task on motor function was measured using uncertainty (measured by Shannon entropy), and local instability (measured by the largest Lyapunov exponent) of elbow flexion and compared between cognitive groups using ANOVAs, while adjusting for age, sex, and BMI. We developed logistic ordinal regression models for predicting cognitive groups based on these nonlinear measures. A total of 81 participants were recruited, including 35 CN (age = 83.8 +/- 6.9), 30 aMCI (age = 83.9 +/- 6.9), and 16 early AD (age = 83.2 + 6.6). Uncertainty of motor function demonstrated the strongest associations with cognitive impairment, with an effect size of 0.52, 0.88, and 0.51 for CN vs. aMCI, CN vs. AD, and aMCI vs. AD comparisons, respectively. Ordinal logistic models predicted cognitive impairment (aMCI and AD combined) with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.82. The findings accentuate the potential of employing nonlinear dynamical features of motor functions during dual-tasking, especially uncertainty, in detecting cognitive impairment.

AB  - The world is slowly recovering from the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic; however, humanity has experienced one of its According to work by Mishra et al. (2020), the study's first phase included a cohort of 5,262 subjects, with 3,325 Fitbit users constituting the majority. However, among this large cohort of 5,262 subjects, most significant trials in modern times only to learn about its lack of preparedness in the face of a highly contagious pathogen. To better prepare the world for any new mutation of the same pathogen or the newer ones, technological development in the healthcare system is a must. Hence, in this work, PCovNet+, a deep learning framework, was proposed for smartwatches and fitness trackers to monitor the user's Resting Heart Rate (RHR) for the infection-induced anomaly. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture was used as the primary model along with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to create latent space embeddings for the VAE. Moreover, the framework employed pre-training using normal data from healthy subjects to circumvent the data shortage problem in the personalized models. This framework was validated on a dataset of 68 COVID-19-infected subjects, resulting in anomalous RHR detection with precision, recall, F-beta, and F-1 score of 0.993, 0.534, 0.9849, and 0.6932, respectively, which is a significant improvement compared to the literature. Furthermore, the PCovNet+ framework successfully detected COVID-19 infection for 74% of the subjects (47% presymptomatic and 27% post-symptomatic detection). The results prove the usability of such a system as a secondary diagnostic tool enabling continuous health monitoring and contact tracing.

AB  - Objective. Sleep apnea (SA) is a chronic condition that fragments sleep and results in intermittent hypoxemia, which in long run leads to cardiovascular diseases like stroke. Diagnosis of SA through polysomnography is costly, inconvenient, and has long waiting list. Wearable devices provide a low-cost solution to the ambulatory detection of SA syndrome for undiagnosed patients. One of the wearables are the ones based on minute-by-minute analysis of single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Processing ECG segments online at wearables contributes to memory conservation and privacy protection in long-term SA monitoring, and light-weight models are required due to stringent computation resource. Approach. We propose fast apnea syndrome screening neural network (FASSNet), an effective end-to-end neural network to perform minute-apnea event detection. Low-frequency components of filtered ECG spectrogram are selected as input. The model initially processes the spectrogram via convolution blocks. Bidirectional long-short-term memory blocks are used along the frequency axis to complement position information of frequency bands. Layer normalisation is implemented to retain in-epoch information since apnea periods have variable lengths. Experiments were carried out on 70 recordings of Apnea-ECG database, where each 60 s ECG segment is manually labelled as an apnea or normal minute by technician. Both ten-fold and patient-agnostic validation protocols are adopted. Main results. FASSNet is light-weighted, since its value of model parameters and multiply accumulates are 0.06% and 28.33% of those of an AlexNet benchmark, respectively. Meanwhile, FASSNet achieves an accuracy of 87.09%, a sensitivity of 77.96%, a specificity of 91.74%, and an F1 score of 81.61% in apnea event detection. Its accuracy of diagnosing SA syndrome severity exceeds 90% under the patient-agnostic protocol. Significance: FASSNet is a computationally efficient and accurate neural network for wearables to detect SA events and estimate SA severity based on minute-level diagnosis.

AB  - Embedded arrhythmia classification is the first step towards heart diseases prevention in wearable applications. In this paper, a robust arrhythmia classification algorithm, NEO-CCNN, for wearables that can be implemented on a simple microcontroller is proposed. The NEO-CCNN algorithm not only detects QRS complex but also accurately locates R-peak with the help of the proposed adaptive time-dependent thresholding technique, improving the accuracy and sensitivity in arrhythmia classification. An optimized compact 1D-CNN network (CCNN) with 9,701 parameters is used for classification. A QRS complex augmentation method is introduced in the training process to cater for R-peak location error (RLE). A nested k(1)k(2)-fold cross-validation method is utilized to evaluate the robustness of the proposed algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has the ability to detect more than 99.79% of R peaks with an RLE of 7.94 ms for the MIT-BIH database. Implemented on the STM32F407 microcontroller, NEO-CNN attains a classification accuracy of 97.83% and sensitivity of 96.46% using only 8s window size.

The performance of the device in cardiovascular monitoring was investigated by (i) comparing the arterial pressure waveform recordings to the gold standard, invasive catheter recording (n = 18), (ii) analyzing the ability to detect irregularities of the rhythm (n = 7), and (iii) measuring the heartrate monitoring accuracy (n = 31). Arterial waveforms carry important physiological information and the comparison study revealed that the recordings made with the wearable device and with the gold standard device resulted in almost identical (r = 0.9-0.99) pulse waveforms. The device can measure the heart rhythm and possible irregularities in it. A clustering analysis demonstrates a perfect classification accuracy between atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus rhythm. The heartrate monitoring study showed near perfect beat-to-beat accuracy (sensitivity = 99.1%, precision = 100%) on healthy subjects. In contrast, beat-to-beat detection from coronary artery disease patients was challenging, but the averaged heartrate was extracted successfully (95% CI: -1.2 to 1.1 bpm). In conclusion, the results indicate that the device could be useful in remote monitoring of cardiovascular diseases and personalized medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We have developed a wireless, wearable Doppler ultrasound system that continuously measures the common carotid artery Doppler pulse. A novel measure from this device, the Doppler shock index, accurately detected moderate-to-severe central blood volume loss in a human hemorrhage model generated by lower body negative pressure. In this analysis, we tested whether the wearable Doppler could identify only mild-to-moderate central blood volume loss.
   METHODS: Eleven healthy volunteers were recruited and studied in a physiology laboratory at the Mayo Clinic. Each participant underwent a lower body negative protocol in duplicate. Carotid Doppler measures including Doppler shock indices were compared with blood pressure and the shock index for their ability to detect both 10% and 20% reductions in stroke volume.
   RESULTS: All carotid Doppler measures were better able to detect diminishing stroke volume than either systolic or mean arterial pressure. Falling carotid artery corrected flow time and rising heart rate/corrected flow time (DSIFTc) were the most sensitive measures for detecting 10% and 20% stroke volume reductions, respectively. The area under the receiver operator curves (AUROCs) for all shock indices was at least 0.86; however, the denominators of the two Doppler shock indices (i.e., the corrected flow time and velocity time integral) had AUROCs ranging between 0.81 and 0.9, while the denominator of the traditional shock index (i.e., systolic blood pressure) had AUROCs between 0.54 and 0.7.
   CONCLUSION: The wearable Doppler ultrasound was able to continuously measure the common carotid artery Doppler pulse. Carotid Doppler measures were highly sensitive at detecting both 10% and 20% stroke volume reduction. All shock indices performed well in their diagnostic ability to measure mild-to-moderate central volume loss, although the denominators of both Doppler shock indices individually outperformed the denominator of the traditional shock index.

AB  - Sit-to-stand and Stand-to-sit transfers (STS) provide relevant information regarding the functional limitation of mobility- impaired patients. The characterization of STS pattern using a single trunk fixed inertial sensor has been proposed as an objective tool to assess changes in functional ability and balance due to disease. Despite significant research efforts, STS quantification remains challenging due to the high inter-and between-subject variability of this motion pattern. The present study aims to improve the performance of STS detection and classification by fusing the information from barometric pressure (BP) and inertial sensors while keeping a single sensor located at the trunk. A total number of 345 STSs were recorded from 12 post-stroke patients monitored in a semi-structured conditioned protocol. Model-based features of BP signal were combined with kinematic parameters from accelerometer and/or gyroscope and used in a logistic regression-based classifier to detect STS and then identify their types. The correct classification rate was 90.6% with full sensor (BP and inertial) configuration and 75.4% with single inertial sensor. Receiver-Operating-Characteristics analysis was carried out to characterize the robustness of the models. The results demonstrate the potential of BP sensor to improve the detection and classification of STSs when monitoring is performed unobtrusively in every-day life.

AB  - In this study, we developed a novel wearable and low-cost device for qualitative screening of glucose (GLU), leukocytes (LEU), and nitrite (NIT) and for semi-quantitative analysis of blood (BLD) and proteins (PRO) in the urine samples. The device can be attached to a diaper, and the results can be read by an app. The main functions of the device can be divided into sample collection, valve closing, and pad saturation; the recorded times for valve closing and pad saturation at four corners and pad saturation at the central parts are pseudo-medians (Hodges-Lehmann estimator) of 3.55 (95% WCI, 3.45-3.72), 6.5 (95% WCI, 6-7), and 6 (95% WCI, 5.5-6.5) minutes, respectively. The RGB values in the reagent pads remain stable from 20 min to 480 min, which satisfies the requirement of regular diaper-wearing time. Pre-diagnostic results indicate high accuracy with good accuracy for the app recognition of five biomarkers in the urine samples, which makes it a promising tool for screening diseases, especially for the elderly healthcare.

AB  - In recent years, Smart Cities and Smart Homes have been studied as an important field of research. The design and construction of smart homes have flourished so that this technology is used for more comfort of people and helping their health. This technology is very useful for single and elderly people especially for Alzheimer's disease patients who are alone at home and need permanent care. A lot of research has been done to detect the activity of users in smart homes. They gather raw data of sensors and use the usual classification algorithms for activity detection. The essence of the time dependency of sensors' data has been ignored in most research, while considering this is very important, especially in the case of Alzheimer's patients. In this study, a Nonlinear AutoRegressive Network (NARX) is employed to detect the patient's activity in a smart home. NARX is a recurrent dynamic network, which is commonly used in time-series modeling. The results show that the proposed model detects user activity, with an accuracy of 0.98. Since the high-risk behavior of the Alzheimer's patient is very unknown; a fuzzy inference system is implemented based on the experience of the Alzheimer's sub-specialist and nurses. The main parameters were extracted and a 3-layers hierarchical fuzzy inference system was developed to detect and alarm the patient's high-risk behavior without wearable sensors. The results show 98% accuracy in detecting the patient's activity and 84% accuracy in determining its abnormality.

AB  - Background Rehabilitative treatment plans after stroke are based on clinical examinations of functional capacity and patient-reported outcomes. Objective information about daily life performance is usually not available, but it may improve therapy personalization. Objective To show that sensor-derived information about daily life performance is clinically valuable for counseling and the planning of rehabilitation programs for individual stroke patients who live at home. Performance information is clinically valuable if it can be used as a decision aid for the therapeutic management or counseling of individual patients. Methods This was an observational, cross-sectional case series including 15 ambulatory stroke patients. Motor performance in daily life was assessed with body-worn inertial sensors attached to the wrists, shanks and trunk that estimated basic physical activity and various measures of walking and arm activity in daily life. Stroke severity, motor function and activity, and degree of independence were quantified clinically by standard assessments and patient-reported outcomes. Motor performance was recorded for an average of 5.03 +/- 1.1 h on the same day as the clinical assessment. The clinical value of performance information is explored in a narrative style by considering individual patient performance and capacity information. Results The patients were aged 59.9 +/- 9.8 years (mean +/- SD), were 6.5 +/- 7.2 years post stroke, and had a National Institutes of Health Stroke Score of 4.0 +/- 2.6. Capacity and performance measures showed high variability. There were substantial discrepancies between performance and capacity measures in some patients. Conclusions This case series shows that information about motor performance in daily life can be valuable for tailoring rehabilitative therapy plans and counseling according to the needs of individual stroke patients. Although the short recording time (average of 5.03 h) limited the scope of the conclusions, this study highlights the usefulness of objective measures of daily life performance for the planning of rehabilitative therapies. Further research is required to investigate whether information about performance in daily life leads to improved rehabilitative therapy results.

AB  - Daily blood glucose monitoring is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Research efforts have been made on developing non-invasive or minimally invasive point-of-care testing system that can minimize the inconvenience of such daily test bringing to diabetes. Hereby, we develop a wearable and portable microneedle based biosensor for in situ glucose detection in an enzyme free and minimally invasive way. The photonic hydrogel film integrated inside the microneedle platform is functionalized with phenylboronic acid and displays glucose responsiveness. Presence of glucose in the chemical matrix of interstitial fluids can be distinguished with naked-eyes via the color changes of the hydrogel film. Quantification of glucose is achieved by analyzing color of hydrogel film with the facilitation of a mobile phone; thereby fast and direct diagnosis is enabled. Extraction of interstitial fluids and sensing of glucose within the psychological range was successfully demonstrated on porcine skin as human skin model. The developed microneedle platform provides a promising tool for detecting other health related analytes in an enzyme-free way with minimal invasiveness.

AB  - Heart rate variability (HRV) indexes are becoming useful in various applications, from better diagnosis and prevention of diseases to predicting stress levels. Typically, HRV indexes are retrieved from the heart's electrical activity collected with an electrocardiographic signal (ECG). Heart-induced mechanical signals recorded from the body's surface can be utilized to record the mechanical activity of the heart and, in turn, extract HRV indexes from interbeat intervals (IBIs). Among others, accelerometers and gyroscopes can be used to register IBIs from precordial accelerations and chest wall angular velocities. However, unlike electrical signals, the morphology of mechanical ones is strongly affected by body posture. In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of estimating the most common linear and non-linear HRV indexes from accelerometer and gyroscope data collected with a wearable skin-interfaced Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) positioned at the xiphoid level. Data were collected from 21 healthy volunteers assuming two common postures (i.e., seated and lying). Results show that using the gyroscope signal in the lying posture allows accurate results in estimating IBIs, thus allowing extracting of linear and non-linear HRV parameters that are not statistically significantly different from those extracted from reference ECG.

AB  - Circadian factors likely influence the occurrence, development, therapy, and prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). To determine the association between the heart rate (HR) diurnal parameters and CVD risks, we designed an analytical strategy to detect diurnal rhythms of HR using longitudinal data collected by clinically used Holter monitors and wearable devices. By combining in-house developed algorithms with existing analytical tools, we obtained trough phase and nocturnal variation in HR for different purposes. The analytical strategy is robust and also sensitive enough to identify variations in HR rhythms influenced by multiple effectors such as jet lag, geological location and altitude, and age from total 211 volunteers. A total of 10,094 sets of 24-h Holter ECG data were analyzed by stepwise partial correlation to determine the critical points of HR trough phase and nocturnal variation. The following HR diurnal patterns correlate with high CVD risk: arrhythmic pattern, anti-phase pattern, rhythmic patterns with trough phase less than 0 (extremely advanced diurnal pattern) or more than 5 (extremely delayed diurnal pattern), and nocturnal variation less than 2.75 (extremely low) or more than 26 (extremely high). In addition, HR trough phases from wearable devices were nearly identical to those from 24-h Holter monitoring from 12 volunteers by linear correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Our analytical system provides useful information to identify functional diurnal patterns and parameters by monitoring personalized, HR-based diurnal changes. These findings have important implications for understanding how a regular heart diurnal pattern benefits cardiac function and raising the possibility of non-pharmacological intervention against circadian related CVDs. With the rapid expansion of wearable devices, public cardiovascular health can be promoted if the analytical strategy is widely applied.

AB  - A large spectrum of healthcare applications, ranging from continuous blood sugar level monitoring to sleep apnea detection are nowadays facilitated by modern mobile gadgets. Wearable and ambient sensors generate enormous amounts of physiological data that demand high computation power for real-time processing and large storage area for recording the personal data. In order to conserve the energy on the battery-limited mainstream mobile devices of the end-users, the execution of the healthcare applications may be offloaded to a remote server. While cloud computing provides unlimited pool of resources for latency-tolerant services such as training a machine learning model, the personalization of healthcare services and the delay sensitivity of continuous health assessment necessitate a computation infrastructure in the vicinity of the end-users. As a remedy to address various demands of a wide range of pervasive healthcare applications, we propose a multi-tier computing and communication architecture composed of end-user devices, edge servers, and legacy cloud data-centers. The dynamic management of this architecture, policies to be applied within the network and the orchestration of the healthcare services are carried out by the concept of programmable networks, in the form of software-defined networking (SDN). As a concrete demonstration of our ideas, a fall risk assessment service is implemented and an experimental study is conducted to evaluate its accuracy and the performance of the multi-tier architecture. The results indicate that the proposed architecture is feasible to enable real-time healthcare services and has significant performance advantages over traditional cloud-based approaches.

AB  - Objective: Upper limb (UL) impairment impacts quality of life, but is common after stroke. UL function evaluated in the clinic may not reflect use in activities of daily living (ADLs) after stroke, and current approaches for assessment at home rely on self-report and lack details about hand function. Wrist-worn accelerometers have been applied to capture UL use, but also fail to reveal details of hand function. In response, a wearable system is proposed consisting of egocentric cameras combined with computer vision approaches, in order to identify hand use (hand-object interactions) and the role of the more-affected hand (as stabilizer or manipulator) in unconstrained environments. Methods: Nine stroke survivors recorded their performance of ADLs in a home simulation laboratory using an egocentric camera. Motion, hand shape, colour, and hand size change features were generated and fed into random forest classifiers to detect hand use and classify hand roles. Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOSOCV) and leave-one-task-out cross-validation (LOTOCV) were used to evaluate the robustness of the algorithms. Results: LOSOCV and LOTOCV F1-scores for more-affected hand use were 0.64 +/- 0.24 and 0.76 +/- 0.23, respectively. For less-affected hands, LOSOCV and LOTOCV F1-scores were 0.72 +/- 0.20 and 0.82 +/- 0.22. F1-scores for hand role classification were 0.70 +/- 0.19 and 0.68 +/- 0.23 in the more-affected hand for LOSOCV and LOTOCV, respectively, and 0.59 +/- 0.23 and 0.65 +/- 0.28 in the less-affected hand. Conclusion: The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting hand use and the hand roles of stroke survivors from egocentric videos.

AB  - Airborne transmission of exhaled virus can rapidly spread, thereby increasing disease progression from local incidents to pandemics. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, states and local governments have enforced the use of protective masks in public and work areas to minimize the disease spread. Here, we have leveraged the function of protective face coverings toward COVID-19 diagnosis. We developed a user-friendly, affordable, and wearable collector. This noninvasive platform is integrated into protective masks toward collecting airborne virus in the exhaled breath over the wearing period. A viral sample was sprayed into the collector to model airborne dispersion, and then the enriched pathogen was extracted from the collector for further analytical evaluation. To validate this design, qualitative colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and antibody-based dot blot assays were performed to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We envision that this platform will facilitate sampling of current SARS-CoV-2 and is potentially broadly applicable to other airborne diseases for future emerging pandemics.

AB  - The prevalence of ubiquitous computing enables new opportunities for lung health monitoring and assessment. In the past few years, there have been extensive studies on cough detection using passively sensed audio signals. However, the generalizability of a cough detection model when applied to external datasets, especially in real-world implementation, is questionable and not explored adequately. Beyond detecting coughs, researchers have looked into how cough sounds can be used in assessing lung health. However, due to the challenges in collecting both cough sounds and lung health condition ground truth, previous studies have been hindered by the limited datasets. In this paper, we propose Listen2Cough to address these gaps. We first build an end-to-end deep learning architecture using public cough sound datasets to detect coughs within raw audio recordings. We employ a pre-trained MobileNet and integrate a number of augmentation techniques to improve the generalizability of our model. Without additional fine-tuning, our model is able to achieve an F1 score of 0.948 when tested against a new clean dataset, and 0.884 on another in-the-wild noisy dataset, leading to an advantage of 5.8% and 8.4% on average over the best baseline model, respectively. Then, to mitigate the issue of limited lung health data, we propose to transform the cough detection task to lung health assessment tasks so that the rich cough data can be leveraged. Our hypothesis is that these tasks extract and utilize similar effective representation from cough sounds. We embed the cough detection model into a multi-instance learning framework with the attention mechanism and further tune the model for lung health assessment tasks. Our final model achieves an F1-score of 0.912 on healthy v.s. unhealthy, 0.870 on obstructive v.s. non-obstructive, and 0.813 on COPD v.s. asthma classification, outperforming the baseline by 10.7%, 6.3%, and 3.7%, respectively. Moreover, the weight value in the attention layer can be used to identify important coughs highly correlated with lung health, which can potentially provide interpretability for expert diagnosis in the future.

AB  - Wearable technologies are becoming a profitable means of monitoring a person's health state, such as heart rate and physical activity. The use of the smartwatch is becoming consolidated, not only as a novelty but also as a very useful tool for daily use. In addition, other devices, such as helmets or belts, are beneficial for monitoring workers and the early detection of any anomaly. They can provide valuable information, especially in work environments, where they help reduce the rate of accidents and occupational diseases, which makes them powerful Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The constant monitoring of the worker's health can be done in real-time, through temperature, falls, noise, impacts, or heart rate meters, activating an audible and vibrating alarm when an anomaly is detected. The gathered information is transmitted to a server in charge of collecting and processing it. In the first place, this paper provides an exhaustive review of the state of the art on works related to electronics for human activity behavior. After that, a smart multisensory bracelet, combined with other devices, developed a control platform that can improve operators' security in the working environment. Artificial Intelligence and the Internet of Things (AIoT) bring together the information to improve safety on construction sites, power stations, power lines, etc. Real-time and historic data is used to monitor operators' health and a hybrid system between Gaussian Mixture Model and Human Activity Classification. That is, our contribution is also founded on the use of two machine learning models, one based on unsupervised learning and the other one supervised. Where the GMM gave us a performance of 80%, 85%, 70%, and 80% for the 4 classes classified in real time, the LSTM obtained a result under the confusion matrix of 0.769, 0.892, and 0.921 for the carrying-displacing, falls, and walking-standing activities, respectively. This information was sent in real time through the platform that has been used to analyze and process the data in an alarm system.

AB  - In recent years, the number of cases of spinal cord injuries, stroke and other nervous impairments have led to an increase in the number of paralyzed patients worldwide. Rehabilitation that can aid and enhance the lives of such patients is the need of the hour. Exoskeletons have been found as one of the popular means of rehabilitation. The existing exoskeletons use techniques that impose limitations on adaptability, instant response and continuous control. Also most of them are expensive, bulky, and requires high level of training. To overcome all the above limitations, this paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered Smart and light weight Exoskeleton System (AI-IoT-SES) which receives data from various sensors, classifies them intelligently and generates the desired commands via Internet of Things (IoT) for rendering rehabilitation and support with the help of caretakers for paralyzed patients in smart and connected communities. In the proposed system, the signals collected from the exoskeleton sensors are processed using AI-assisted navigation module, and helps the caretakers in guiding, communicating and controlling the movements of the exoskeleton integrated to the patients. The navigation module uses AI and IoT enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). The casualties of a paralyzed person are reduced by commissioning the IoT platform to exchange data from the intelligent sensors with the remote location of the caretaker to monitor the real time movement and navigation of the exoskeleton. The automated exoskeleton detects and take decisions on navigation thereby improving the life conditions of such patients. The experimental results simulated using MATLAB shows that the proposed system is the ideal method for rendering rehabilitation and support for paralyzed patients in smart communities.

Initially, the authentication is performed by means of the patient. Then, the sensed values are attained as of the ' sensors that are placed inside the bra. Later, the DK-AES algorithm uploads the attained data safely to the hospital public cloud server (CS). Subsequently, the hospital management (HM) system downloads the data securely. The HM-system envisages BC in '2' phases: (1) pre-processing and (2) prediction. Utilizing removal redundancy, replacement of missing attributes, along with normalization, the data is pre-processed. Subsequently, the OKM-ANFIS classification algorithm predicts the disease. If any critical concerns arise, an alert text is sent by the HM to the patient's mobile. In an experimental assessment, the proposed work renders better outcomes than the prevailing methods.

AB  - With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), investigation of different diseases in healthcare improved, and cloud computing helped to centralize the data and to access patient records throughout the world. In this way, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is used to diagnose heart diseases or abnormalities. The machine learning techniques have been used previously but are feature-based and not as accurate as transfer learning; the proposed development and validation of embedded device prove ECG arrhythmia by using the transfer learning (DVEEA-TL) model. This model is the combination of hardware, software, and two datasets that are augmented and fused and further finds the accuracy results in high proportion as compared to the previous work and research. In the proposed model, a new dataset is made by the combination of the Kaggle dataset and the other, which is made by taking the real-time healthy and unhealthy datasets, and later, the AlexNet transfer learning approach is applied to get a more accurate reading in terms of ECG signals. In this proposed research, the DVEEA-TL model diagnoses the heart abnormality in respect of accuracy during the training and validation stages as 99.9% and 99.8%, respectively, which is the best and more reliable approach as compared to the previous research in this field.

AB  - Background: Differences in autonomic nervous system function, measured by heart rate variability (HRV), have been observed between patients with inflammatory bowel disease and healthy control patients and have been associated in cross-sectional studies with systemic inflammation. High HRV has been associated with low stress.
   Methods: Patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) were followed for 9 months. Their HRV was measured every 4 weeks using the VitalPatch, and blood was collected at baseline and every 12 weeks assessing cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein (CRP). Stool was collected at enrollment and every 6 weeks for fecal calprotectin. Surveys assessing symptoms, stress, resilience, quality of life, anxiety, and depression were longitudinally collected.
   Results: Longitudinally evaluated perceived stress was significantly associated with systemic inflammation (CRP, P = 0.03) and UC symptoms (P = 0.02). There was a significant association between HRV and stress (low-frequency to high-frequency power [LFHF], P = 0.04; root mean square of successive differences [RMSSD], P = 0.04). The HRV was associated with UC symptoms (LFHF, P = 0.03), CRP (high frequency, P < 0.001; low frequency, P < 0.001; RMSSD, P < 0.001), and fecal calprotectin (high frequency, P < 0.001; low frequency, P < 0.001; RMSSD, P < 0.001; LFHF, P < 0.001). Significant changes in HRV indices from baseline developed before the identification of a symptomatic or inflammatory flare (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Longitudinally evaluated HRV was associated with UC symptoms, inflammation, and perceived and physiological measures of stress. Significant changes in HRV were observed before the development of symptomatic or inflammatory flare.

AB  - The acquisition of physiological data are essential to efficiently predict and treat cardiac patients before a heart attack occurs and effectively expedite motor recovery after a stroke. This goal can be achieved by using wearable wireless sensor network platforms for real-time healthcare monitoring. In this paper, we present a wireless physiological signal acquisition device and a smartphone-based software platform for real-time data processing and monitor and cloud server access for everyday ECG/EMG signal monitoring. The device is implemented in a compact size (diameter: 30 mm, thickness: 4.5 mm) where the biopotential is measured and wirelessly transmitted to a smartphone or a laptop for real-time monitoring, data recording and analysis. Adaptive digital filtering is applied to eliminate any interference noise that can occur during a regular at-home environment, while minimizing the data process time. The accuracy of ECG and EMG signal coverage is assessed using Bland-Altman analysis by comparing with a reference physiological signal acquisition instrument (RHS2116 Stim/Recording System, Intan). Signal coverage of R-R peak intervals showed almost identical outcome between this proposed work and the RHS2116, showing a mean difference in heart rate of 0.15 +/- 4.65 bpm and a Wilcoxon's p value of 0.133. A 24 h continuous recording session of ECG and EMG is conducted to demonstrate the robustness and stability of the device based on extended time wearability on a daily routine.

AB  - Mental workload is a neuroergonomic human factor, which is widely used in planning a system's safety and areas like brain-machine interface (BMI), neurofeedback, and assistive technologies. Robotic prosthetics methodologies are employed for assisting hemiplegic patients in performing routine activities. Assistive technologies' design and operation are required to have an easy interface with the brain with fewer protocols, in an attempt to optimize mobility and autonomy. The possible answer to these design questions may lie in neuroergonomics coupled with BMI systems. In this study, two human factors are addressed: designing a lightweight wearable robotic exoskeleton hand that is used to assist the potential stroke patients with an integrated portable brain interface using mental workload (MWL) signals acquired with portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system. The system may generate command signals for operating a wearable robotic exoskeleton hand using two-state MWL signals. The fNIRS system is used to record optical signals in the form of change in concentration of oxy and deoxygenated hemoglobin (HbO and HbR) from the pre-frontal cortex (PFC) region of the brain. Fifteen participants participated in this study and were given hand-grasping tasks. Two-state MWL signals acquired from the PFC region of the participant's brain are segregated using machine learning classifier-support vector machines (SVM) to utilize in operating a robotic exoskeleton hand. The maximum classification accuracy is 91.31%, using a combination of mean-slope features with an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 1.43. These results show the feasibility of a two-state MWL (fNIRS-based) robotic exoskeleton hand (BMI system) for hemiplegic patients assisting in the physical grasping tasks.

AB  - Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness for people who have diabetes in the world. However, early detection of this disease can essentially decrease its effects on the patient. The recent breakthroughs in technologies, including the use of smart health systems based on Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain are trying to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. In this study, we presented an AI-based smart teleopthalmology application for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. The app has the ability to facilitate the analyses of eye fundus images via deep learning from the Kaggle database using Tensor Flow mathematical library. The app would be useful in promoting mHealth and timely treatment of diabetic retinopathy by clinicians. With the AI-based application presented in this paper, patients can easily get supports and physicians and researchers can also mine or predict data on diabetic retinopathy and reports generated could assist doctors to determine the level of severity of the disease among the people.

AB  - Perinatal stroke (PS), occurring between 20 weeks of gestation and 28 days of life, is a leading cause of hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). Hallmarks of HCP are motor and sensory impairments on one side of the body-especially the arm and hand contralateral to the stroke (involved side). HCP is diagnosed months or years after the original brain injury. One effective early intervention for this population is constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), where the uninvolved arm is constrained by a mitt or cast, and therapeutic activities are performed with the involved arm. In this preliminary investigation, we used 3D motion capture to measure the spatiotemporal characteristics of pre-reaching upper extremity movements and any changes that occurred when constraint was applied in a real-time laboratory simulation. Participants were N = 14 full-term infants: N = six infants with typical development; and N = eight infants with PS (N = three infants with PS were later diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP)) followed longitudinally from 2 to 6 months of age. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of using 3D motion capture to identify the differences in the spatiotemporal characteristics of the pre-reaching upper extremity movements between the diagnosis group, involved versus uninvolved side, and with versus and without constraint applied in real time. This would be an excellent application of wearable sensors, allowing some of these measurements to be taken in a clinical or home setting.

AB  - Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of nonprogressive neuro-developmentalconditions occurring in early childhood that causes movement disorders and physical disability. Measuring activity levels and gait patterns is an important aspect of CP rehabilitation programs. Traditionally, such programs utilize commercially available laboratory systems, which cannot to be utilized in community living. In this study, a novel, shoe-based, wearable sensor system (pediatric SmartShoe) was tested on 11 healthy children and 10 children with CP to validate its use for monitoring of physical activity and gait. Novel data processing techniques were developed to remove the effect of orthotics on the sensor signals. Machine learning models were developed to automatically classify the activities of daily living. The temporal gait parameters estimated from the SmartShoe data were compared against reference measurements on a GAITRite mat. A leave-one-out cross-validation method indicated a 95.3% average accuracy of activity classification (for sitting, standing, and walking) for children with CP and 96.2% for healthy children. Average relative errors in gait parameter estimation (gait cycle, stance, swing, and step time, % single support time on both lower extremities, along with cadence) ranged from 0.2% to 6.4% (standard deviation range = 1.4%-9.9%). These results suggest that the pediatric SmartShoe can accurately measure physical activity and gait of children with CP and can potentially be used for ambulatory monitoring.

TI  - 5G-Smart Diabetes: Toward Personalized Diabetes Diagnosis with Healthcare Big Data Clouds
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
LA  - English
AB  - Recent advances in wireless networking and big data technologies, such as 5G networks, medical big data analytics, and the Internet of Things, along with recent developments in wearable computing and artificial intelligence, are enabling the development and implementation of innovative diabetes monitoring systems and applications. Due to the life-long and systematic harm suffered by diabetes patients, it is critical to design effective methods for the diagnosis and treatment of diabetes. Based on our comprehensive investigation, this article classifies those methods into Diabetes 1.0 and Diabetes 2.0, which exhibit deficiencies in terms of networking and intelligence. Thus, our goal is to design a sustainable, cost-effective, and intelligent diabetes diagnosis solution with personalized treatment. In this article, we first propose the 5G-Smart Diabetes system, which combines the state-of-the-art technologies such as wearable 2.0, machine learning, and big data to generate comprehensive sensing and analysis for patients suffering from diabetes. Then we present the data sharing mechanism and personalized data analysis model for 5G-Smart Diabetes.

AB  - Physiological signals can contain abundant personalized information and indicate health status and disease deterioration. However, in current medical practice, clinicians working in the general wards are usually lack of plentiful means and tools to continuously monitor the physiological signals of the inpatients. To address this problem, we here presented a medical-grade wireless monitoring system based on wearable and artificial intelligence technology. The system consists of a multi-sensor wearable device, database servers and user interfaces. It can monitor physiological signals such as electrocardiography and respiration and transmit data wirelessly. We highly integrated the system with the existing hospital information system and explored a set of processes of physiological signal acquisition, storage, analysis, and combination with electronic health records. Multi-scale information extracted from physiological signals and related to the deterioration or abnormality of patients could be shown on the user interfaces, while a variety of reports could be provided daily based on time-series signal processing technology and machine learning to make more information accessible to clinicians. Apart from an initial attempt to implement the system in a realistic clinical environment, we also conducted a preliminary validation of the core processes in the workflow. The heart rate veracity validation of 22 patient volunteers showed that the system had a great consistency with ECG Holter, and bias for heart rate was 0.04 (95% confidence interval: -7.34 to 7.42) beats per minute. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 98.52% of the points were located between Mean +/- 1.96SD. This system has been deployed in the general wards of the Hyperbaric Oxygen Department and Respiratory Medicine Department and has collected more than 1000 cases from the clinic. The whole system will continue to be updated based on clinical feedback. It has been demonstrated that this system can provide reliable physiological monitoring for patients in general wards and has the potential to generate more personalized pathophysiological information related to disease diagnosis and treatment from the continuously monitored physiological data.

AB  - The high morbidity, mortality, and huge numbers of affected individuals have delineated cardiovascular diseases as one of the most vulnerable global health burdens. Amongst the top proteins to reflect ventricular dysfunction, Brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP or ProBNP) carries substantial potential towards estimating human heart risk, both at the prognostic and diagnostic level. Herein, clinically significant concentrations of ProBNP ranging from 100 fg/mL to 100 ng/mL are assessed via a hydrothermally synthesized 2-D SnS2 nanomaterial enhanced ultrasensitive and selective portable electrochemical biosensor. X-ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy, and Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectroscopy are performed for material characterization. The transduction mechanism is realized through the covalent immobilization of the target specific antibodies on the bioelectrode surface. Multiplex trigger signals, i.e., cyclic voltammetry (CV), differential pulse voltammetry (DPV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), are employed to explore the antigen-antibody binding event. The sensitivity of the proposed sensor is found to be 11.7355 (Delta R/R) (ng/ mL)(-1)cm(-2) in case of EIS and 103.2396 (Delta Ip/Ip) % (ng/mL)(-1)cm(-2) in case of DPV with the lowest limit of detection being 0.225 fg/mL (SNR=3.3) for 5 mg/mL SnS2-DMF dispersion. Further, it is subjected to interference, stability, selectivity, and recovery studies in PBS and plasma matrix aiming at the on-field diagnostic performance.

AB  - A sudden cardiac event in patients with heart disease can lead to a heart attack in extreme cases. Therefore, prompt interventions for the particular heart situation and periodic monitoring are critical. This study focuses on a heart sound analysis method that can be monitored daily using multimodal signals acquired with wearable devices. The dual deterministic model-based heart sound analysis is designed in a parallel structure that uses two bio-signals (PCG and PPG signals) related to the heartbeat, enabling more accurate heart sound identification. The experimental results show promising performance of the proposed Model III (DDM-HSA with window and envelope filter), which had the highest performance, and S1 and S2 showed average accuracy (unit: %) of 95.39 (+/- 2.14) and 92.55 (+/- 3.74), respectively. The findings of this study are anticipated to provide improved technology to detect heart sounds and analyze cardiac activities using only bio-signals that can be measured using wearable devices in a mobile environment.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a seismic shift in education to web-based learning. With nearly 20 million students enrolled in colleges across the United States, the long-simmering mental health crisis in college students was likely further exacerbated by the pandemic.
   Objective: This study leveraged mobile health (mHealth) technology and sought to (1) characterize self-reported outcomes of physical, mental, and social health by COVID-19 status; (2) assess physical activity through consumer-grade wearable sensors (Fitbit); and (3) identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity in a population of college students prior to release of the vaccine.
   Methods: After completing a baseline assessment (ie, at Time 0 [T0]) of demographics, mental, and social health constructs through the Roadmap 2.0 app, participants were instructed to use the app freely, wear the Fitbit, and complete subsequent assessments at T1, T2, and T3, followed by a COVID-19 assessment of history and timing of COVID-19 testing and diagnosis (T4: -14 days after T3). Continuous measures were described using mean (SD) values, while categorical measures were summarized as n (%) values. Formal comparisons were made on the basis of COVID-19 status. The multivariate model was determined by entering all statistically significant variables (P<.05) in univariable associations at once and then removing one variable at a time through backward selection until the optimal model was obtained.
   Results: During the fall 2020 semester, 1997 participants consented, enrolled, and met criteria for data analyses. There was a high prevalence of anxiety, as assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Index, with moderate and severe levels in 465 (24%) and 970 (49%) students, respectively. Approximately one-third of students reported having a mental health disorder (n=656, 33%). The average daily steps recorded in this student population was approximately 6500 (mean 6474, SD 3371). Neither reported mental health nor step count were significant based on COVID-19 status (P=.52). Our analyses revealed significant associations of COVID-19 positivity with the use of marijuana and alcohol (P=.02 and P=.046, respectively) and with lower belief in public health measures (P=.003). In addition, graduate students were less likely and those with >= 20 roommates were more likely to report a COVID-19 diagnosis (P=.009).
   Conclusions: Mental health problems were common in this student population. Several factors, including substance use, were associated with the risk of COVID-19. These data highlight important areas for further attention, such as prioritizing innovative strategies that address health and well-being, considering the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on college students.

AB  - Digital clinical histopathology technique is used for accurately diagnos -ing cancer cells and achieving optimal results using Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology. The cell pattern of Synovial Sarcoma (SS) cancer images always appeared as spindle shaped cell (SSC) structures. Identifying the SSC and its prognostic indicator are very crucial problems for computer aided diagnosis, especially in healthcare industry applications. A constructive framework has been proposed for the classification of SSC feature components using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with the assistance of relevant Support Vectors (SVs). This fra-mework used the SS images, and it has been transformed into frequency sub-bands using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The sub-band wavelet coeffi- cients of SSC and other Structure Features (SF) are extracted using Principle Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) techniques. Here, the maximum and minimum margin between hyperplane values of the kernel parameters are adjusted periodi-cally as a result of storing the SF values of the SVs in the IoT devices. The per-formance characteristics of internal cross-validation and its statistical properties are evaluated by cross-en tropy measures and compared by nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test. The significant differences in classification performance between the techniques are analyzed using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The combination of QDA + SVM technique will be required for intelligent cancer diagnosis in the future, and it gives reduced statistic parameter feature set with greater classification accuracy. The IoT network based QDA + SVM classification technique has led to the improvement of SS cancer prognosis in medical industry applications using blockchain technology.

AB  - As the fast development of wearable devices and Internet of things technologies, real-time monitoring of ECG signals is quite critical for cardiovascular diseases. However, dynamic ECG signals recorded in free-living conditions suffered from extremely serious noise pollution. Presently, most algorithms for ECG signal evaluation were designed to divide signals into acceptable and unacceptable. Such classifications were not enough for real-time cardiovascular disease monitoring. In the study, a wearable ECG quality database with 50,085 recordings was built, including A/B/C (or high quality/medium quality/low quality) three quality grades (A: high quality signals can be used for CVD detection; B: slight contaminated signals can be used for heart rate extracting; C: heavily polluted signals need to be abandoned). A new SQA classification method based on a three-layer wavelet scattering network and transfer learning LSTM was proposed in this study, which can extract more systematic and comprehensive characteristics by analyzing the signals thoroughly and deeply. Experimental results (mACC = 98.56%, mF (1) = 98.55%, Se (A) = 97.90%, Se (B) = 98.16%, Se (C) = 99.60%, +P (A) = 98.52%, +P (B) = 97.60%, +P (C) = 99.54%, F (1A) = 98.20%, F (1B) = 97.90%, F (1C) = 99.60%) and real data validations proved that this proposed method showed the high accuracy, robustness, and computationally efficiency. It has the ability to evaluate the long-term dynamic ECG signal quality. It is advantageous to promoting cardiovascular disease monitoring by removing contaminating signals and selecting high-quality signal segments for further analysis.

AB  - Introduction: Telemedicine (TM) has transformed the field of emergency cardiology, particularly the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The ability to record an electrocardiogram (EKG) in the early prehospital phase, thus avoiding any delay in diagnosing myocardial infarction with direct transfer to the cath-lab for primary angioplasty, has proven to significantly reduce treatment times and mortality. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the available evidence and organizational models based on a support by TM in cardiology, including the applications of TM in cardiovascular disease based on a review of the literature. Results: The most important areas of application of TM in the field of cardiology are as follows: (1) Early prehospital diagnosis of AMI with EKG transmission; (2) Patient Remote control through wearable and devices; (3) Monitoring of patients with chronic heart failure; (4) Monitoring of patient's arrhythmias; and (5) Transmission of echo images to a III level center for a "second opinion". Conclusions: TM services should, therefore, be considered as a true diagnostic/therapeutic aspect of cardiovascular emergencies. It is necessary to educate medical staff and to provide a tempting environment for software engineers. Investing in infrastructure and equipment is imperative, as well as a positive climate for its implementation.

TI  - A Context-Aware MRIPPER Algorithm for Heart Disease Prediction
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - These days, mobile computing devices are ubiquitous and are widely used in almost every facet of daily life. In addition, computing and the modern technologies are not really coexisting anymore. With a wide range of conditions and areas of concern, the medical domain was also concerned. New types of technologies, such as context-aware systems and applications, are constantly being infused into the medicine field. An IoT-enabled healthcare system based on context awareness is developed in this work. In order to collect and store the patient data, smart medical devices are employed. Context-aware data from the database includes the patient's medical records and personal information. The MRIPPER (Modified Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error) technique is used to analyze and classify the data. A rule-based machine learning method is used in this algorithm. The rules for analyzing datasets in order to make predictions about heart disease are framed using this algorithm. MATLAB is used to simulate the proposed model's performance analysis. Other models like random forest, J48, CART, JRip, and OneR algorithms are also compared to validate the proposed model's performance. The proposed model obtains 98.89 percent accuracy, 96.76 percent precision, 99.05 percent sensitivity, 94.35 percent specificity, and 97.60 percent f-score. Predictions for subjects in the normal and abnormal classes were both accurate with 97.38 for normal and 97.93 for abnormal subjects.

AB  - This paper introduces technical solutions devised to support the Deployment Site - Regione Emilia Romagna (DS-RER) of the ACTIVAGE project. The ACTIVAGE project aims at promoting IoT (Internet of Things)-based solutions for Active and Healthy ageing. DS-RER focuses on improving continuity of care for older adults (65+) suffering from aftereffects of a stroke event. A Wireless Sensor Kit based on Wi-Fi connectivity was suitably engineered and realized to monitor behavioral aspects, possibly relevant to health and wellbeing assessment. This includes bed/rests patterns, toilet usage, room presence and many others. Besides hardware design and validation, cloud-based analytics services are introduced, suitable for automatic extraction of relevant information (trends and anomalies) from raw sensor data streams. The approach is general and applicable to a wider range of use cases; however, for readability's sake, two simple cases are analyzed, related to bed and toilet usage patterns. In particular, a regression framework is introduced, suitable for detecting trends (long and short-term) and labeling anomalies. A methodology for assessing multi-modal daily behavioral profiles is introduced, based on unsupervised clustering techniques. The proposed framework has been successfully deployed at several real-users' homes, allowing for its functional validation. Clinical effectiveness will be assessed instead through a Randomized Control Trial study, currently being carried out.

AB  - With the invent of medical expert systems, the demand for efficient innovative techniques in signal processing to detect abnormalities is ever increasing for identifying heart-related problems. The major objective of this research is to offer medical services to people in remote villages at low cost. People in villages and remote areas do not have a facility to get treated by a medical expert. This research provides them an opportunity to get medical advice through the virtual environment called the VH-doctor machine. It is a virtual environment heart doctor and reduces the human effort in testing and treating of heart diseases at the initial stages. The patients are treated and diagnosed only with the help of machines but not human effort. Biomedical sensors, ARM processor and FPGA are used to detect, test, analyze and display normal or abnormal cases. In this research, ECG signal processing, feature extraction and KNN classifier are performed and achieve the highest accuracy of 99% better than other machine learning algorithms.

AB  - Background: Rugby league is a full-contact collision sport with an inherent risk of concussion. Wearable instrumented technology was used to observe and characterize the level of exposure to head impacts during game play.
   Purpose: To verify the impacts recorded by the x-patch (TM) with video analysis.
   Study design: Observational case series.
   Methods: The x-patch (TM) was used on eight men's semi-professional rugby league players during the 2016 Newcastle Rugby League competition (five forwards and three backs). Game day footage was recorded by a trained videographer using a single camera located at the highest midfield location to verify the impact recorded by the x-patch (TM). Videographic and accelerometer data were time synchronized.
   Results: The x-patch (TM) sensors recorded a total of 779 impacts >= 20 g during the games, of which 732 (94.0%) were verified on video. In addition, 817 impacts were identified on video that did not record an impact on the sensors. The number of video-verified impacts >= 20 g, per playing hour, was 7.8 for forwards and 4.8 for backs (range = 3.9-19.0). Impacts resulting in a diagnosed concussion had much greater peak linear acceleration (M = 76.1 g, SD = 17.0) than impacts that did not result in a concussion (M = 34.2g, SD = 18.0; Cohen's d = 2.4).
   Conclusions: The vast majority (94%) of impacts >= 20 g captured by the x-patch (TM) sensor were video verified in semiprofessional rugby league games. The use of a secondary source of information to verify impact events recorded by wearable sensors is beneficial in clarifying game events and exposure levels.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT), as a new revolution in the digital world, is rapidly expanding in many areas, especially in health care. As IoT devices face challenges in processing and storing information, cloud and IoT integration leads to the development of efficient services and applications. However, one of the big challenges of cloud technology is service delays for remote patients who often require immediate control at different times. Therefore, a new technology called fog computing can be used as an interface between the cloud and end-users to minimize the problem of latency and improve accessibility. On the other hand, heart disease is known to be the second leading cause of death in the world due to various problems in the proper functioning of the heart. One of these problems is cardiac arrhythmia, which can lead to irreparable problems such as heart attack if not diagnosed. One way to diagnose this disease is to make an Electrocardiogram (ECG) from the patient. The purpose of this article is to propose a system for monitoring the health of a patient (a case of cardiac arrhythmia). Arduino's electronic board and AD8232 sensor module were used to test and run the system to monitor heart rhythm and perform electrocardiography. Therefore, the k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm, one of the most commonly used data mining algorithms, is used to classify and validate the type of cardiac arrhythmia. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Simple Summary Breast cancer is leading cancer increases the death rate in women. Early diagnosis of breast cancer in women can save their lives. The current study proposed a novel scheme to detect architectural distortion from mammogram images to predict breast cancer using a deep learning approach. Results are evaluated on a public and a private dataset which may help to improve the diagnostic ability of breast cancer of radiologists and doctors in daily clinical routines. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved maximum accuracy as compared with previous approaches. This study can be interesting and valuable in the healthcare predictive modeling domain and will add a real contribution to society. Architectural distortion is the third most suspicious appearance on a mammogram representing abnormal regions. Architectural distortion (AD) detection from mammograms is challenging due to its subtle and varying asymmetry on breast mass and small size. Automatic detection of abnormal ADs regions in mammograms using computer algorithms at initial stages could help radiologists and doctors. The architectural distortion star shapes ROIs detection, noise removal, and object location, affecting the classification performance, reducing accuracy. The computer vision-based technique automatically removes the noise and detects the location of objects from varying patterns. The current study investigated the gap to detect architectural distortion ROIs (region of interest) from mammograms using computer vision techniques. Proposed an automated computer-aided diagnostic system based on architectural distortion using computer vision and deep learning to predict breast cancer from digital mammograms. The proposed mammogram classification framework pertains to four steps such as image preprocessing, augmentation and image pixel-wise segmentation. Architectural distortion ROI's detection, training deep learning, and machine learning networks to classify AD's ROIs into malignant and benign classes. The proposed method has been evaluated on three databases, the PINUM, the CBIS-DDSM, and the DDSM mammogram images, using computer vision and depth-wise 2D V-net 64 convolutional neural networks and achieved 0.95, 0.97, and 0.98 accuracies, respectively. Experimental results reveal that our proposed method outperforms as compared with the ShuffelNet, MobileNet, SVM, K-NN, RF, and previous studies.

AB  - The World Health Organization recognizes physical activity as an influencing domain on quality of life. Monitoring, evaluating, and supervising it by wearable devices can contribute to the early detection and progress assessment of diseases such as Alzheimer's, rehabilitation, and exercises in telehealth, as well as abrupt events such as a fall. In this work, we use a non-invasive and non-intrusive flexible wearable device for 3D spine pose measurement to monitor and classify physical activity. We develop a comprehensive protocol that consists of 10 indoor, 4 outdoor, and 8 transition states activities in three categories of static, dynamic, and transition in order to evaluate the applicability of the flexible wearable device in human activity recognition. We implement and compare the performance of three neural networks: long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN), and a hybrid model (CNN-LSTM). For ground truth, we use an accelerometer and strips data. LSTM reached an overall classification accuracy of 98% for all activities. The CNN model with accelerometer data delivered better performance in lying down (100%), static (standing = 82%, sitting = 75%), and dynamic (walking = 100%, running = 100%) positions. Data fusion improved the outputs in standing (92%) and sitting (94%), while LSTM with the strips data yielded a better performance in bending-related activities (bending forward = 49%, bending backward = 88%, bending right = 92%, and bending left = 100%), the combination of data fusion and principle components analysis further strengthened the output (bending forward = 100%, bending backward = 89%, bending right = 100%, and bending left = 100%). Moreover, the LSTM model detected the first transition state that is similar to fall with the accuracy of 84%. The results show that the wearable device can be used in a daily routine for activity monitoring, recognition, and exercise supervision, but still needs further improvement for fall detection.

AB  - Wireless biosensors are essential for digital transformations in health and medicine. Chipless resonant antenna-based biosensors are affordable and tractable but are unsuitable for practical use because the common wireless sensing systems have low sensitivity caused by low quality factors. Herein, a parity-time (PT) symmetric wireless biosensor is demonstrated that can detect small biological signals such as tear glucose level (0.1-0.6 mm) for diabetes diagnosis and blood lactate level (0.0-4.0 mm) for lactic acidosis diagnosis. The characteristics of the PT-symmetric wireless sensing system are modeled by using an eigenvalue solution and input impedance, and the sensitivity enhancement at/near the exceptional point by using parallel inductance-capacitance-resistance resonators is experimentally demonstrated. 2000 times higher sensitivity for linear detection and 78% relative change for threshold-based detection are achieved. Furthermore, the proposed PT-symmetric wireless sensing system has sufficient tunability and robustness for use as a wearable/implantable device for monitoring small biological signals.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and has a major impact on morbidity and mortality; however, detection of asymptomatic AF is challenging. This study aims to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of non-invasive AF detection by a medical wearable. In this observational trial, patients with AF admitted to a hospital carried the wearable and an ECG Holter (control) in parallel over a period of 24 h, while not in a physically restricted condition. The wearable with a tight-fit upper armband employs a photoplethysmography technology to determine pulse rates and inter-beat intervals. Different algorithms (including a deep neural network) were applied to five-minute periods photoplethysmography datasets for the detection of AF. A total of 2306 h of parallel recording time could be obtained in 102 patients; 1781 h (77.2%) were automatically interpretable by an algorithm. Sensitivity to detect AF was 95.2% and specificity 92.5% (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) 0.97). Usage of deep neural network improved the sensitivity of AF detection by 0.8% (96.0%) and specificity by 6.5% (99.0%) (AUC 0.98). Detection of AF by means of a wearable is feasible in hospitalized but physically active patients. Employing a deep neural network enables reliable and continuous monitoring of AF.

AB  - Objective We collected naturalistic heart rate data from veterans diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to investigate the effects of various factors on heart rate. Background PTSD is prevalent among combat veterans in the United States. While a positive correlation between PTSD and heart rate has been documented, specific heart rate profiles during the onset of PTSD symptoms remain unknown. Method Veterans were recruited during five cycling events in 2017 and 2018 to record resting and activity-related heart rate data using a wrist-worn device. The device also logged self-reported PTSD hyperarousal events. Regression analyses were performed on demographic and behavioral covariates including gender, exercise, antidepressants, smoking habits, sleep habits, average heart rate during reported hyperarousal events, age, glucocorticoids consumption, and alcohol consumption. Heart rate patterns during self-reported PTSD hyperarousal events were analyzed using Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). Heart rate data were also compared to an open-access non-PTSD representative case. Results Of 99 veterans with PTSD, 91 participants reported at least one hyperarousal event, with a total of 1023 events; demographic information was complete for 38 participants who formed the subset for regression analyses. The results show that factors including smoking, sleeping, gender, and medication significantly affect resting heart rate. Moreover, unique heart rate patterns associated with PTSD symptoms in terms of stationarity, autocorrelation, and fluctuation characteristics were identified. Conclusion Our findings show distinguishable heart rate patterns and characteristics during PTSD hyperarousal events. Application These findings show promise for future work to detect the onset of PTSD symptoms.

AB  - Background: The aim of the present study is to demonstrate, through tests with healthy volunteers, the feasibility of potentially assisting individuals with neurological disorders via a portable assistive technology for the upper extremities (UE). For this purpose the task of independently drinking a glass of water was selected, as it is one of the most basic and vital activities of the daily living that is unfortunately not achievable by individuals severely affected by stroke.
   Methods: To accomplish the aim of this study we introduce a wearable and portable system consisting of a novel lightweight Robotic Arm Orthosis (RAO), a Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) system, and a simple wireless Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). This system is able to process electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and translate them into motions of the impaired arm. Five healthy volunteers participated in this study and were asked to simulate stroke patient symptoms with no voluntary control of their hand and arm. The setup was designed such as the volitional movements of the healthy volunteers' UE did not interfere with the evaluation of the proposed assistive system. The drinking task was split into eleven phases of which seven were executed by detecting EEG-based signals through the BCI. The user was asked to imagine UE motion related to the specific phase of the task to be assisted. Once detected by the BCI the phase was initiated. Each phase was then terminated when the BCI detected the volunteers clenching their teeth.
   Results: The drinking task was completed by all five participants with an average time of 127 seconds with a standard deviation of 23 seconds. The incremental motions of elbow extension and elbow flexion were the primary limiting factors for completing this task faster. The BCI control along with the volitional motions also depended upon the users pace, hence the noticeable deviation from the average time.
   Conclusion: Through tests conducted with healthy volunteers, this study showed that our proposed system has the potential for successfully assisting individuals with neurological disorders and hemiparetic stroke to independently drink from a glass.

AB  - Blockchain has penetrated numerous domains such as, industries, government agencies, online voting, and healthcare, etc. Among these domains, healthcare is one of the trending and most important one, which consists of a control system and an Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Diabetes is one of the most rapidly growing chronic diseases that increases the death ratio across the globe. This paper presents a Blockchain-enabled diabetes disease detection framework that provides an earlier detection of this disease by using various machine learning classification algorithms and maintains the EHRs of the patients in a secure manner. Our EHRs sharing framework combines symptom-based disease prediction, Blockchain, and interplanetary file system (IPFS) in which the patient's health information are collected via wearable sensor devices. This information is then sent to EHRs manager, where an ML model is executed for further processing to collect the desired results. The results along with the physiological parameters are then stored in the Blockchain with the approval of concerned patient and his/her practitioner. It is anticipated that our proposed system will help the healthcare society in order to store, process, and share the patient health information in a secure manner.

AB  - Background: Gait speed is a robust nonspecific predictor of health outcomes. We examined if combinations of gait speed and other mobility metrics are associated with specific health outcomes.
   Methods: A sensor (triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope) placed on the lower back, measured mobility in the homes of 1,249 older adults (77% female; 80.0, SD = 7.72 years). Twelve gait scores were extracted from five performances, including (a) walking, (b) transition from sit to stand, (c) transition from stand to sit, (d) turning, and (e) standing posture. Using separate Cox proportional hazards models, we examined which metrics were associated with time to mortality, incident activities of daily living disability, mobility disability, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease dementia. We used a single integrated analytic framework to determine which gait scores survived to predict each outcome.
   Results: During 3.6 years of follow-up, 10 of the 12 gait scores predicted one or more of the five health outcomes. In further analyses, different combinations of 2-3 gait scores survived backward elimination and were associated with the five outcomes. Sway was one of the three scores that predicted activities of daily living disability but was not included in the final models for other outcomes. Gait speed was included along with other metrics in the final models predicting mortality and activities of daily living disability but not for other outcomes.
   Conclusions: When analyzing multiple mobility metrics together, different combinations of mobility metrics are related to specific adverse health outcomes. Digital technology enhances our understanding of impaired mobility and may provide mobility biomarkers that predict distinct health outcomes.

AB  - Respiratory diseases are common in post-stroke hemiplegic patients and represent a major social problem as they worsen the quality of life and reduce the life span. As a consequence, being able to monitor respiratory parameters such as the respiratory rate (RR) and assess the presence of respiratory asynchronies could be of paramount importance to define hemiplegics' health status. Moreover, RR is a useful parameter to investigate the level of fatigue and distress that these patients undergo during rehabilitation processes. Although motion capture systems and flowmeters are the leading instruments for respiratory pattern evaluation, smart wearable systems are gaining ever more acceptance since they allow continuous monitoring by detecting chest wall breathing displacements, ensuring reduced costs and no need for dedicated spaces. Among other sensing technologies, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors have emerged thanks to their high sensitivity to strain, lightness, and multiplexing capability. In this work, a wearable system composed of four flexible dumbbell-shaped sensing modules is proposed for respiratory monitoring in hemiplegic patients. The system is light and easy to wear and can be adapted to any anthropometry thanks to the modular anchoring system. Its feasibility assessment in RR evaluation was performed on seven hemiplegic volunteers in eupnea and tachypnea breathing conditions. In addition, an explorative investigation was conducted to assess the system's ability to detect asynchronies between torso compartments. The good results suggest that this device could be a useful instrument to support clinicians and operators in hemiplegic patients' management.

AB  - The long-term assessment of radon (Rn) is a critical factor in evaluating the exposure risk faced by building occupants, and it plays a significant role in determining the implementation of Rn remediation strategies aimed at enhancing indoor air quality (IAQ). Meteorological parameters, such as temperature, relative humidity, and atmospheric pressure, as well as geological factors, such as soil properties, uranium content, rock formations, parent rock weathering, and water content, can significantly impact the assessment of Rn exposure risk and the selection of appropriate mitigation measures. A continuous monitoring campaign of a National Architectural Heritage building serving as a museum open to the public for a period of 546 consecutive days was conducted. The results of the in situ investigation revealed a broad range of seasonality in indoor Rn emission, with a negative correlation observed between Rn concentration and air temperature. The data indicated that indoor Rn concentration increases in the winter months as a result of reduced indoor air temperature and decreased air exchange, while it decreases in the summer months due to increased air temperature and enhanced natural ventilation. However, the implementation of high ventilation rates to improve IAQ may result in significant heat losses, thereby affecting the thermal comfort of building occupants during the winter months. Therefore, it is imperative to achieve a balance between ventilation practices and energy efficiency requirements to ensure both IAQ and thermal comfort for building occupants.

AB  - Use of food image capture and/or wearable sensors for dietary assessment has grown in popularity. Active - methods rely on the user to take an image of each eating episode. "Passive" methods use wearable cameras that continuously capture images. Most of "passively" captured images are not related to food consumption and may present privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel wearable sensor (Automatic Ingestion Monitor. AIM-2) designed to capture images only during automatically detected eating episodes. The capture method was validated on a dataset collected from 30 volunteers in the community wearing the AIM-2 for 24h in pseudo-free-living and 24h in a free-living environment. The AIM-2 was able to detect food intake over 10-second epochs with a (mean and standard deviation) Fl-score of 81.8 +/- 10.1%. The accuracy of eating episode detection was 82.7%. Out of a total of 180,570 images captured, 8,929 (4.9%) images belonged to detected eating episodes. Privacy concerns were assessed by a questionnaire on a scale 1-7. Continuous capture had concern value of 5.0 +/- 1.6 (concerned) while image capture only during food intake had concern value of 1.9 +/- 1.7 (not concerned). Results suggest that AIM-2 can provide accurate detection of food intake, reduce the number of images for analysis and alleviate the privacy concerns of the users.

AB  - Impressive growth in the number of wearable health monitoring devices has affected global health industry as they provide rapid and intricate details related to physical examinations, such as discomfort, heart rate, and blood glucose level, which enable doctors to efficiently diagnose sensitive heart troubles. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a phenomenon wherein computer networks and medical equipment are connected through the Internet to provide real-time interaction between physicians and patients. In this article, we present a comprehensive view of the IoMT and its related Machine Learning (ML)-based developed frameworks designed, or being utilized, in the last decade, i.e., from 2010 to 2019. The presented techniques are designed for monitoring limbs, controlling rural healthcare, identifying e-health applications, monitoring health through mobile apps, classifying heart sounds, detecting stress in drivers, monitoring cardiac diseases, making the decision to predict heart attacks, recognizing human activities, and classifying breast cancer. The aim is to provide a clear picture of the existing IoMT environment so that the analysis may pave the way for the diagnosis of critical disorders such as cancer, heart attack, and blood pressure among others. In the end, we also provide some unresolved challenges that are confronted in the deployment of the secure IoMT-based healthcare systems.

AB  - Health monitoring and its associated technologies have gained enormous importance over the past few years. The electrocardiogram (ECG) has long been a popular tool for assessing and diagnosing cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Since the literature on ECG monitoring devices is growing at an exponential rate, it is becoming difficult for researchers and healthcare professionals to select, compare, and assess the systems that meet their demands while also meeting the monitoring standards. This emphasizes the necessity for a reliable reference to guide the design, categorization, and analysis of ECG monitoring systems, which will benefit both academics and practitioners. We present a complete ECG monitoring system in this work, describing the design stages and implementation of an end-to-end solution for capturing and displaying the patient's heart signals, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and body temperature. The data will be presented on an OLED display, a developed Android application as well as in MATLAB via serial communication. The Internet of Things (IoT) approaches have a clear advantage in tackling the problem of heart disease patient care as they can transform the service mode into a widespread one and alert the healthcare services based on the patient's physical condition. Keeping this in mind, there is also the addition of a web server for monitoring the patient's status via WiFi. The prototype, which is compliant with the electrical safety regulations and medical equipment design, was further benchmarked against a commercially available off-the-shelf device, and showed an excellent accuracy of 99.56%.

AB  - Objective: Analyzing human motion is essential for diagnosing movement disorders and guiding rehabilitation for conditions like osteoarthritis, stroke, and Parkinson's disease. Optical motion capture systems are the standard for estimating kinematics, but the equipment is expensive and requires a predefined space. While wearable sensor systems can estimate kinematics in any environment, existing systems are generally less accurate than optical motion capture. Many wearable sensor systems require a computer in close proximity and use proprietary software, limiting experimental reproducibility. Methods: Here, we present OpenSenseRT, an open-source and wearable system that estimates upper and lower extremity kinematics in real time by using inertial measurement units and a portable microcontroller. Results: We compared the OpenSenseRT system to optical motion capture and found an average RMSE of 4.4 degrees across 5 lower-limb joint angles during three minutes of walking and an average RMSE of 5.6 degrees across 8 upper extremity joint angles during a Fugl-Meyer task. The open-source software and hardware are scalable, tracking 1 to 14 body segments, with one sensor per segment. A musculoskeletal model and inverse kinematics solver estimate Kinematics in real-time. The computation frequency depends on the number of tracked segments, but is sufficient for real-time measurement for many tasks of interest; for example, the system can track 7 segments at 30 Hz in real-time. The system uses off-the-shelf parts costing approximately $100 USD plus $20 for each tracked segment. Significance: The OpenSenseRT system is validated against optical motion capture, low-cost, and simple to replicate, enabling movement analysis in clinics, homes, and free-living settings

AB  - Arrhythmias are very common in the healthy populations as well as patients with cardiovascular diseases. Among them, atrial fibrillation (AF) and malignant ventricular arrhythmias are usually associated with some clinical events. Early diagnosis of arrhythmias, particularly AF and ventricular arrhythmias, is very important for the treatment and prognosis of patients. Holter is a gold standard commonly recommended for noninvasive detection of paroxysmal arrhythmia. However, it has some shortcomings such as fixed detection timings, delayed report and inability of remote real-time detection. To deal with such problems, we designed and applied anew wearable 72-hour triple-lead H3-electrocardiogram (ECG) device with a remote cloud-based ECG platform and an expert-supporting system. In this study, 31 patients were recruited and 24-hour synchronous ECG data by H3-ECG and Holter were recorded. In the H3-ECG group, ECG signals were transmitted using remote real-time modes, and confirmed reports were made by doctors in the remote expert-supporting system, while the traditional modes and detection systems were used in the Holter group. The results showed no significant differences between the two groups in 24-hour total heart rate (HR), averaged HR, maximum HR, minimum HR, premature atrial complexes (PACs) and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) (P>0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of capture and remote automatic cardiac events detection of PACs, PVCs, and AF by H3-ECG were 93% and 99%, 98% and 99%, 94% and 98%, respectively. Therefore, the long-term limb triple-lead H3-ECG device can be utilized for domiciliary ECG self-monitoring and remote management of patients with common arrhythmia under medical supervision.

AB  - Digital health technologies may support the management and prevention of disease through personalized lifestyle interventions. Wearables and smartphones are increasingly used to continuously monitor health and disease in everyday life, targeting health maintenance. Here, we aim to demonstrate the potential of wearables and smartphones to (1) detect eating moments and (2) predict and explain individual glucose levels in healthy individuals, ultimately supporting health self-management. Twenty-four individuals collected continuous data from interstitial glucose monitoring, food logging, activity, and sleep tracking over 14 days. We demonstrated the use of continuous glucose monitoring and activity tracking in detecting eating moments with a prediction model showing an accuracy of 92.3% (87.2-96%) and 76.8% (74.3-81.2%) in the training and test datasets, respectively. Additionally, we showed the prediction of glucose peaks from food logging, activity tracking, and sleep monitoring with an overall mean absolute error of 0.32 (+/-0.04) mmol/L for the training data and 0.62 (+/-0.15) mmol/L for the test data. With Shapley additive explanations, the personal lifestyle elements important for predicting individual glucose peaks were identified, providing a basis for personalized lifestyle advice. Pending further validation of these digital biomarkers, they show promise in supporting the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes through personalized lifestyle recommendations.

AB  - Background Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative condition that gradually worsens motor function and leads to postural instability and, eventually, falls. Several factors may influence the frequency of future falls, such as slowness, freezing of gait, loss of balance, and mobility problems, cognitive impairments, and the number of previous falls. The TED bracelet is an advanced technological wearable device able to predict falls. Aims This principal aim is to investigate the feasibility of a full-scale research project that uses the TED bracelet to identify whether individuals with PD are at risk of falling. Methods This study will involve a pilot prospective observational study design; the subjects will include 26 patients suffering from mild PD and 26 others with no PD and no gait problems. Data will be collected from the TED bracelet and then compared to a paper-based fall diary. The enrolled participants will have a scheduled outpatient evaluation to collect both clinical and instrumental data as well as biological samples. Discussion This pilot study could then be implemented in a larger form to further evaluate the effectiveness of the TED device. Finally, it will help further develop gait monitoring systems for people with Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases that can affect physical function and mobility, such as dementia and Alzheimer's. Conclusions Preventing falls and their complications could lead to major advancements in the quality of home care for patients with PD, which would significantly impact the quality of life of both these patients and their caregivers.

AB  - Objectives: Exertional heat stroke (EHS) remains a significant health concern while training in hot environments, prompting the development of noninvasive wearable technology for monitoring estimated core temperature (ECT). The objective of this study was to review the effectiveness of an ECT device during elite military training by providing a case series of individuals who developed EHS. Methods: This is a retrospective study of EHS cases during high-intensity training while wearing the ECT device, Zephyr Bioharness(TM). Data was collected from January 2021 through September 2021 at the Air Force Special Warfare Training pipeline in San Antonio, TX. Rectal temperatures of EHS diagnoses, defined by central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction and rectal temperature approaching or >40 degrees C (104 degrees F), were compared to ECT reading via Zephyr Bioharness(TM). Incidence rates and psychometric properties were calculated using R package. Results: A total of 47,058 daily peak ECT measurements were collected among 1,364 trainees. A total of 499 trainees flagged as potential EHS by Zephyr Bioharness(TM) reading >39.7 degrees C (103.5 degrees F). The incidence of confirmed EHS was 0.8/1000 person-months. Of the 10 confirmed EHS cases (9 males, 1 female; age = 23.4 +/- 2.7 yrs; BMI = 25 +/- 2; body fat = 13 +/- 5%), 8 trainees had a peak ECT reading below 39.7 degrees C which resulted in a sensitivity of 20%, specificity of 98.9%, positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 18.93 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 5.5-65.6), and a negative LR of 0.81 (95% CI 0.6-1.1). Conclusion: ECT had substantial false positive and negative rates. Further studies are needed to validate this technology in other populations, and the algorithm used in this device needs to be refined to better capture the environmental and physical requirements in the special operations population.

AB  - Bio-signals are being increasingly used for the assessment of pathophysiological conditions including pain, stress, fatigue, and anxiety. For some approaches, a single signal is not sufficient to provide a comprehensive diagnosis; however, there is a growing consensus that multimodal approaches allow higher sensitivity and specificity. For instance, in visceral pain subjects, the autonomic activation can be inferred using electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate variability derived from the electrocardiogram (ECG), but including the muscle activation detected from the surface electromyogram (sEMG) can better differentiate the disease that causes the pain. There is no wearable device commercially capable of collecting these three signals simultaneously. This paper presents the validation of a novel multimodal low profile wearable data acquisition device for the simultaneous collection of EDA, ECG, and sEMG signals. The device was validated by comparing its performance to laboratory-scale reference devices. N = 20 healthy subjects were recruited to participate in a four-stage study that exposed them to an array of cognitive, orthostatic, and muscular stimuli, ensuring the device is sensitive to a range of stressors. Time and frequency domain analyses for all three signals showed significant similarities between our device and the reference devices. Correlation of sEMG metrics ranged from 0.81 to 0.95 and EDA/ECG metrics showed few instances of significant difference in trends between our device and the references. With only minor observed differences, we demonstrated the ability of our device to collect EDA, sEMG, and ECG signals. This device will enable future practical and impactful advances in the field of chronic pain and stress measurement and can confidently be implemented in related studies.

AB  - Objective: To provide proof-of-concept for a novel method to recognize impaired push-off and foot-drop deficits in hemiparetic gait using analog pressure sensors. These data may enhance feedback from a modular ankle exoskeleton (such as Anklebot) for stroke rehabilitation, which now employs on/off foot switches under the foot. Methods: A pressure sensor was positioned on the posterior side of the calcaneus. Experiments were conducted on two healthy subjects with normal walking and with hip circumduction and foot drop, the latter to mimic hemiparetic gait post-stroke. Results: Unlike the foot switches, the pressure sensor yielded data during swing. The initial swing and terminal stance readings followed local foot-shoe dynamics and were thus able to detect foot drop swing deficits while also providing push-off information during stance. Discussion: The analog pressure sensors provided more information than foot switches, even during stance. This system may provide clinicians with a tool to monitor foot drop and push-off.

AB  - Mechano-acoustic signals emanating from the heart and lungs contain valuable information about the cardiopulmonary system. Unobtrusive wearable sensors capable of monitoring these signals longitudinally can detect early pathological signatures and titrate care accordingly. Here, we present a wearable, hermetically-sealed high-precision vibration sensor that combines the characteristics of an accelerometer and a contact microphone to acquire wideband mechano-acoustic physiological signals, and enable simultaneous monitoring of multiple health factors associated with the cardiopulmonary system including heart and respiratory rate, heart sounds, lung sounds, and body motion and position of an individual. The encapsulated accelerometer contact microphone (ACM) utilizes nano-gap transducers to achieve extraordinary sensitivity in a wide bandwidth (DC-12 kHz) with high dynamic range. The sensors were used to obtain health factors of six control subjects with varying body mass index, and their feasibility in detection of weak mechano-acoustic signals such as pathological heart sounds and shallow breathing patterns is evaluated on patients with preexisting conditions.

AB  - BackgroundLong-term adherence to exercise is often poor for people with coronary heart disease (CHD) who have completed supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a remotely prescribed, delivered and monitored cardiac rehabilitation intervention using a wearable device to support long-term adherence to exercise and physical activity during maintenance of cardiac rehabilitation. MethodsAfter completing cardiac rehabilitation, 30 participants with CHD, will be randomised (1:1) to an intervention (n = 15) or a usual care group (n = 15) in a 12-month feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT). The intervention will comprise of an exercise consultation, personalised exercise prescription delivered via a wearable activity monitor using biometric feedback, regular monitoring via check-ins, and feedback text-messages for 6-months. Participants will be assessed at baseline (following completion of cardiac rehabilitation) and at three-, six-, and 12-months post-randomisation. The primary outcome will be feasibility, including assessment of eligibility, recruitment, adherence, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes will include exercise capacity, physical activity behaviours, cardiovascular disease risk and quality of life. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted at three-, six-, and 12-months post-randomisation (and with those who drop-out) to explore the acceptability of the study intervention and procedures. A questionnaire will be offered to those who decline participation. DiscussionThe MAINTAIN study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a future definitive multi-centre RCT testing a remotely prescribed and monitored long-term mHealth maintenance exercise programme, versus usual care, for people with CHD who have completed cardiac rehabilitation.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally; fortunately, 90% of cardiovascular diseases are preventable by long-term monitoring of physiological signals. Stable, ultralow power consumption, and high-sensitivity sensors are significant for miniaturized wearable physiological signal monitoring systems. Here, this study proposes a flexible self-powered ultrasensitive pulse sensor (SUPS) based on triboelectric active sensor with excellent output performance (1.52 V), high peak signal-noise ratio (45 dB), long-term performance (10 ' cycles), and low cost price. Attributed to the crucial features of acquiring easy-processed pulse waveform, which is consistent with second derivative of signal from conventional pulse sensor, SUPS can be integrated with a bluetooth chip to provide accurate, wireless, and real-time monitoring of pulse signals of cardiovascular system on a smart phone/PC. Antidiastole of coronary heart disease, atrial septal defect, and atrial fibrillation are made, and the arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation) is indicative diagnosed from health, by characteristic exponent analysis of pulse signals accessed from volunteer patients. This SUPS is expected to be applied in self-powered, wearable intelligent mobile diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in the future.

AB  - Future smart agents, like robots, should produce personalized behaviours based on user emotions and moods to fit more in ordinary users' activities. Besides, the emotions are also linked to human cognitive systems, thus their monitoring could be extremely useful in the case of neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer. Literature works propose the use of music tracks and videos to stimulate emotions, and cameras to recorder the evoked reactions in human beings. However, these approaches may not be effective in everyday life, due to camera obstructions and different types of stimulation which can be related also with the interaction with other human beings. In this work, we investigate the Electrocardiogram, the ElectroDermal Activity and the Brain Activity signals as main informative channels, acquired through a wireless wearable sensor network. An experimental methodology was built to induce three different emotional states through social interaction. Collected data were classified with three supervised machine learning approaches with different kernels (Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and k-nearest neighbour) considering the valence dimension and a combination of valence and arousal dimension evoked during the interaction. 34 healthy young participants were involved in the study and a total of 239 instances were analyzed. The supervised algorithms achieve an accuracy of 0.877 in the best case.

AB  - Ulceration of the diabetic foot is currently difficult to detect reliably in a timely manner causing undue suffering and cost. Current best practice is for daily monitoring by those living with diabetes coupled to scheduled monitoring by the incumbent care provider. Although some metrics have proven useful in the detection or prediction of ulceration, no single metric can currently be relied upon for diagnosis. We have developed a prototype multivariate extensible sensor platform with which we demonstrate the ability to gather acceleration, rotation, galvanic skin response, environmental temperature, humidity, force, skin temperature and bioimpedance signals in real time, for later analysis, utilising low cost Raspberry Pi and Arduino devices. We demonstrate the utility of the Raspberry Pi computer in research which is of particular interest to this issue of electronics-Raspberry Pi edition. We conclude that the hardware presented shows potential as an adaptable research tool capable of gathering synchronous data over multiple sensor modalities. This research tool will be utilised to optimise sensor selection, placement and algorithm development prior to translation into a sock, insole or platform diagnostic device at a later date. The combination of a number of clinically relevant parameters is expected to provide greater understanding of tissue state in the foot but requires further volunteer testing and analysis beyond the scope of this paper which will be reported in due course.

AB  - Simple Summary Breast cancer is one of the foremost causes of cancer-related mortality in women. It is curable and controllable only if detected early. Microcalcifications in breast tissue are essential predictors for radiologists to detect early-stage breast cancer. This study proposes a method for detecting and classifying microcalcifications in mammogram images to predict breast lesions, using machine learning coupled with an interpretable radiomics approach. The method was evaluated using a publicly accessible dataset, which may aid radiologists and clinicians in identifying breast cancer in their regular clinical practices. This study contributes to the field of predictive modeling in healthcare. Microcalcifications in breast tissue can be an early sign of breast cancer, and play a crucial role in breast cancer screening. This study proposes a radiomics approach based on advanced machine learning algorithms for diagnosing pathological microcalcifications in mammogram images and provides radiologists with a valuable decision support system (in regard to diagnosing patients). An adaptive enhancement method based on the contourlet transform is proposed to enhance microcalcifications and effectively suppress background and noise. Textural and statistical features are extracted from each wavelet layer's high-frequency coefficients to detect microcalcification regions. The top-hat morphological operator and wavelet transform segment microcalcifications, implying their exact locations. Finally, the proposed radiomic fusion algorithm is employed to classify the selected features into benign and malignant. The proposed model's diagnostic performance was evaluated on the MIAS dataset and compared with traditional machine learning models, such as the support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, and random forest, using different evaluation parameters. Our proposed approach outperformed existing models in diagnosing microcalcification by achieving an 0.90 area under the curve, 0.98 sensitivity, and 0.98 accuracy. The experimental findings concur with expert observations, indicating that the proposed approach is most effective and practical for early diagnosing breast microcalcifications, substantially improving the work efficiency of physicians.

AB  - Aims: Using specials wearable sensors, we explored changes in gait and balance parameters, over time, in elderly patients at high risk of diabetic foot, wearing different types of footwear. This assessed the relationship between gait and balance changes in elderly diabetic patients and the development of foot ulcers, in a bid to uncover potential benefits of wearable devices in the prognosis and management of the aforementioned complication. Methods: A wearable sensor-based monitoring system was used in middle-elderly patients with diabetes who recently recovered from neuropathic plantar foot ulcers. A total of 6 patients (age range: 55-80 years) were divided into 2 groups: the therapeutic footwear group (n = 3) and the regular footwear (n = 3) group. All subjects were assessed for gait and balance throughout the study period. Walking ability and gait pattern were assessed by allowing participants to walk normally for 1 min at habitual speed. The balance assessment program incorporated the "feet together" standing test and the instrumented modified Clinical Test of Sensory Integration and Balance. Biomechanical information was monitored at least 3 times. Results: We found significant differences in stride length (p < 0.0001), stride velocity (p < 0.0001), and double support (p < 0.0001) between the offloading footwear group (OG) and the regular footwear group on a group x time interaction. The balance test embracing eyes-open condition revealed a significant difference in Hip Sway (p = 0.004), COM Range ML (p = 0.008), and COM Position (p = 0.004) between the 2 groups. Longitudinally, the offloading group exhibited slight improvement in the performance of gait parameters over time. The stride length (odds ratio 3.54, 95% CI 1.34-9.34, p = 0.018) and velocity (odds ratio 3.13, 95% CI 1.19-8.19, p = 0.033) of OG patients increased, converse to the double-support period (odds ratio 6.20, 95% CI 1.97-19.55, p = 0.002), which decreased. Conclusions: Special wearable devices can accurately monitor gait and balance parameters in patients in real time. The finding reveals the feasibility and effectiveness of advanced wearable sensors in the prevention and management of diabetic foot ulcer and provides a solid background for future research. In addition, the development of foot ulcers in elderly diabetic patients may be associated with changes in gait parameters and the nature of footwear. Even so, larger follow-up studies are needed to validate our findings.

AB  - In deploying the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based applications and infrastructures, the researchers faced many sensors and their output's values, which have transferred between service requesters and servers. Some case studies addressed the different methods and technologies, including machine learning algorithms, deep learning accelerators, Processing-In-Memory (PIM), and neuromorphic computing (NC) approaches to support the data processing complexity and communication between IoMT nodes. With inspiring human brain structure, some researchers tackled the challenges of rising IoT- and IoMT-based applications and neural structures' simulation. A defective device has destructive effects on the performance and cost of the applications, and their detection is challenging for a communication infrastructure with many devices. We inspired astrocyte cells to map the flow (AFM) of the Internet of Medical Things onto mesh network processing elements (PEs), and detect the defective devices based on a phagocytosis model. This study focuses on an astrocyte's cholesterol distribution into neurons and presents an algorithm that utilizes its pattern to distribute IoMT's dataflow and detect the defective devices. We researched Alzheimer's symptoms to understand astrocyte and phagocytosis functions against the disease and employ the vaccination COVID-19 dataset to define a set of task graphs. The study improves total runtime and energy by approximately 60.85% and 52.38% after implementing AFM, compared with before astrocyte-flow mapping, which helps IoMT's infrastructure developers to provide healthcare services to the requesters with minimal cost and high accuracy.

TI  - Multimodal Wearable Sensing for Fine-Grained Activity Recognition in Healthcare
T2  - IEEE INTERNET COMPUTING
LA  - English
AB  - State-of-the-art in-home activity recognition schemes with wearable devices are mostly capable of detecting coarse-grained activities (sitting, standing, walking, or lying down), but can't distinguish complex activities (sitting on the floor versus on the sofa or bed). Such schemes aren't effective for emerging critical healthcare applications - for example, in remote monitoring of patients with Alzheimer's disease, bulimia, or anorexia - because they require a more comprehensive, contextual, and fine-grained recognition of complex daily user activities. Here, a novel approach for in-home, fine-grained activity recognition uses multimodal wearable sensors on multiple body positions, along with lightly deployed Bluetooth beacons in the environment.

AB  - Objectives: Nondimensional indices or numbers can provide a generalized approach for integrating sev-eral biological parameters into one Nondimensional Physiological Index (NDPI) that can help characterize an abnormal state associated with a particular physiological system. In this paper, we have presented four Nondimensional Physiological Indices (NDI, DBI, DIN, CGMDI) for the accurate detection of diabetes subjects. Methodology: The NDI, DBI, and DIN diabetes indices are based on the Glucose-Insulin Regulatory System (GIRS) Model, represented by the governing differential equation of blood glucose concentration response to the glucose input rate. The solutions of this governing differential equation are employed to simulate the clinical data of the Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), and thereby evaluate the GIRS model-system parameters, which are distinctly different for the normal and diabetic subjects. Then these GIRS model parameters are combined to form singular nondimensional indices: NDI, DBI, and DIN. When these in-dices are applied to the OGTT clinical data, we get significantly different values for normal and diabetic subjects. The DIN diabetes index is a more objective index involving extensive clinical studies, incorporating the GIRS model parameters as well as some key clinical-data markers (based on the information gained from the model clinical simulation and parametric identification). We have then developed another CGMDI diabetes index based on the GIRS model, for the assessment of diabetic subjects using the glucose levels measured by wearable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. Clinical study and results: For the DIN diabetes index, our clinical study comprised of 47 subjects (26 normal and 21 diabetics). After applying DIN to the OGTT data, a Distribution Plot of DIN was developed, displaying the ranges of DIN for (i) normal (i.e., non-diabetic) subjects with no risk of becoming diabetic, (ii) normal subjects at risk of becoming diabetic, (iii) borderline diabetic subjects who can become normal (with diet control and treatment), and (iv) distinctly diabetic subjects. This distribution plot is shown to distinctly separate normal subjects from diabetic subjects and also from subjects at risk of becoming diabetic. Conclusions: In this paper, we have developed several NDPIs in the form of novel nondimensional dia-betes indices for the accurate detection of diabetes and diagnosis of diabetic subjects. These nondimen-sional diabetes indices can enable precision medical diagnostics of diabetes, and thereby also help to develop interventional guidelines for lowering glucose levels by means of insulin infusion. The novelty of our proposed CGMDI is that it utilizes the glucose value monitored by the CGM wearable device. In the future, an app can be developed to use the CGM data in the CGMDI to enable precision diabetes detection. (c) 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wearable sweat sensors offer the possibility of continuous real-time health monitoring of an individual at a low cost without invasion. A variety of sweat glucose sensors have been developed thus far to help diabetes patients frequently monitor blood glucose levels through sweat glucose as a surrogate marker. The present study demonstrates the development and characterization of a three-dimensional paper-based microfluidic electrochemical integrated device (3D PMED) for measuring glucose concentration in sweat in real-time via simple, non-invasive, capillary-action-based sample collection. The device was selective for glucose, and it detected glucose accurately in the clinically relevant range (0 similar to 2 mM) in an off-body setup. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time NEXAR (TM) has been used for biosensing applications. Further, the developed glucose sensor has acceptable sensitivity of 16.8 mu A/mM/cm(2). Importantly, in an on-body setup, the device achieved a significant amperometric response to sweat glucose in a very short amount of time (a few seconds). With detailed investigations, this proof-of-concept study could help further the development of sensitive and selective sweat-based glucose sensing devices for real-time glucose monitoring in diabetes patients.

AB  - With the development of information technology, health management and big data have risen and developed in recent years. Big data need proper analysis and shape in order to extract meaningful information from it. This paper analyzes the application status and prospects of big data in the field of health management. The results show that the most widely used big data in health management are intelligent wearable devices. Big data applications in football players' mental health monitoring systems and chronic disease health management systems also have a good prospect. The intelligent wearable device is applied to several aspects of sports work: teaching and sports training, real-time monitoring of football players' physical exercise process, collecting football players' heart rate, calorie consumption, exercise steps, and track, blood pressure, blood oxygen, and other physical exercise data; through monitoring the heart rate, we can get the intensity and duration of football players' physical exercise in school; through the calculation, we can also get the football players' time energy consumption and understand the overall situation of football players' physical exercise in school; through step counting and track monitoring, we can master the number of steps and track of football players; by monitoring the changes of blood oxygen and blood pressure of football players, we need to build a third-party residents' health information storage and analysis system and further realize the marketization of residents' health big data. The experimental results of the proposed study show the effectiveness of the proposed work.

KW  - ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION
KW  - STROKE
AB  - Background While the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has cleared smartwatch software for detecting atrial fibrillation (AF), there is lack of guidance on management by physicians. We sought to evaluate the approach to management of Apple Watch alerts for AF by physicians and assess whether respondent and case characteristics were associated with their approach.Methods We conducted a case-based survey of physicians practicing primary care, emergency medicine, and car-diology at 2 large academic centers (Yale and University of California San Francisco) between September and December 2021. Cases described asymptomatic patients receiving Apple Watch AF alerts; cases varied in sex, race, medical history, and notification frequency. We evaluated physician responses among prespecified diagnostic testing, referral, and treatment options.Results We emailed 636 physicians, of whom 95 (14.9%) completed the survey, including 39 primary care, 25 emer-gency medicine, and 31 cardiology physicians. Among a total of 192 cases (16 unique scenarios), physicians selected at least one diagnostic test in 191 (99.5%) cases and medications in 48 (25.0%). Physicians in primary care, emergency medicine, and cardiology reported varying preference for patient referral (14%, 30%, and 16%, respectively; P =.048), rhythm monitoring (84%, 46%, and 94%, respectively; P <.001), measurement of BNP (8%, 20%, and 2%; P =.003), and use of antiarrhythmics (16%, 4%, and 23%; P =.023). There were few physician differences in reported practices across patient demographics (sex and race), clinical complexity, and alert frequency of the clinical case.Conclusions In hypothetical cases of patients presenting without clinical symptoms, physicians opted for further di-agnostic testing and often to medical intervention based on Apple Watch irregular rhythm notifications. There was also considerable variation across physician specialties, suggesting a need for uniform clinical practice guidelines.

AB  - Insomnia is a common sleep disorder in which patients cannot sleep properly. Accurate detection of insomnia disorder is a crucial step for mental disease analysis in the early stages. The disruption in getting quality sleep is one of the big sources of cardiovascular syndromes such as blood pressure and stroke. The traditional insomnia detection methods are time-consuming, cumbersome, and more expensive because they demand a long time from a trained neurophysiologist, and they are prone to human error, hence, the accuracy of diagnosis gets compromised. Therefore, the automatic insomnia diagnosis from the electrocardiogram (ECG) records is vital for timely detection and cure. In this paper, a novel hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) approach is proposed based on the power spectral density (PSD) of the heart rate variability (HRV) to detect insomnia in three classification scenarios: (1) subject-based classification scenario (normal Vs. insomnia), (2) sleep stage-based classification (REM Vs. W. stage), and (3) the combined classification scenario using both subject-based and sleep stage-based deep features. The ensemble learning of random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifiers are used to perform the first and second classification scenarios, while the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier is used to perform the third combined scenario. The proposed framework includes data collection, investigation of the ECG signals, extraction of the signal HRV, estimation of the PSD, and AI-based classification via hybrid machine learning classifiers. The proposed framework is fine-tuned and evaluated using the free public PhysioNet dataset over fivefold trails cross-validation. For the subject-based classification scenario, the detection performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy is recorded to be 96.0%, 94.0%, and 96.0%, respectively. For the sleep stage-based classification scenario, the detection evaluation results are recorded equally with 96.0% for ceiling level accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. For the combined classification scenario, the LDA classifier has achieved the best insomnia detection accuracy with 99.0%. In the future, the proposed hybrid AI approach could be applicable for mobile observation schemes to automatically detect insomnia disorders.

AB  - As day-to-day-generated data become massive in the 6G-enabled Internet of medical things (IoMT), the process of medical diagnosis becomes critical in the healthcare system. This paper presents a framework incorporated into the 6G-enabled IoMT to improve prediction accuracy and provide a real-time medical diagnosis. The proposed framework integrates deep learning and optimization techniques to render accurate and precise results. The medical computed tomography images are preprocessed and fed into an efficient neural network designed for learning image representations and converting each image to a feature vector. The extracted features from each image are then learned using a MobileNetV3 architecture. Furthermore, we enhanced the performance of the arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) based on the hunger games search (HGS). In the developed method, named AOAHG, the operators of the HGS are applied to enhance the AOA's exploitation ability while allocating the feasible region. The developed AOAG selects the most relevant features and ensures the overall model classification improvement. To assess the validity of our framework, we conducted evaluation experiments on four datasets, including ISIC-2016 and PH2 for skin cancer detection, white blood cell (WBC) detection, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) classification, using different evaluation metrics. The framework showed remarkable performance compared to currently existing methods in the literature. In addition, the developed AOAHG provided results better than other FS approaches according to the obtained accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as performance measures. For example, AOAHG had 87.30%, 96.40%, 88.60%, and 99.69% for the ISIC, PH2, WBC, and OCT datasets, respectively.

AB  - Presently, cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) with cloud computing (CC) enabled intelligent healthcare models are developed, which enables communication with intelligent devices, sensor modules, and other stakeholders in the healthcare sector to avail effective decision making. On the other hand, Alzheimer disease (AD) is an advanced and degenerative illness which injures the brain cells, and its earlier detection is necessary for suitable interference by healthcare professional. In this aspect, this paper presents a new Oriented Features from Accelerated Segment Test (FAST) with Rotated Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features (BRIEF) Detector (ORB) with optimal artificial neural network (ORB-OANN) model forADdiagnosis and classification on the CIoT based smart healthcare system. For initial pre-processing, bilateral filtering (BLF) based noise removal and region of interest (RoI) detection processes are carried out. In addition, the ORB-OANN model includesORBbased feature extractor and principal component analysis (PCA) based feature selector. Moreover, artificial neural network (ANN) model is utilized as a classifier and the parameters of the ANN are optimally chosen by the use of salp swarm algorithm (SSA). A comprehensive experimental analysis of the ORB-OANN model is carried out on the benchmark database and the obtained results pointed out the promising outcome of the ORB-OANN technique in terms of different measures.

AB  - In this article, we discuss a technical design and an ongoing trial that is being conducted in the UK, called Technology Integrated Health Management (TIHM). TIHM uses Internet of Things-enabled solutions provided by various companies in a collaborative project. The Internet of Things (IoT) devices and solutions are integrated in a common platform that supports interoperable and open standards. A set of machine-learning and data analytics algorithms generate notifications regarding the well-being of the patients. The information is monitored around the clock by a group of healthcare practitioners who take appropriate decisions according to the collected data and generated notifications. In this article, we discuss the design principles and the lessons that we have learned by co-designing this system with patients, their careers, clinicians, and also our industry partners. We discuss the technical design of TIHM and explain why user-centered design and human experience should be an integral part of the technological design.

AB  - The advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud services have enabled the availability of smart e-healthcare services in a distant and distributed environment. However, this has also raised major privacy and efficiency concerns that need to be addressed. While sharing clinical data across the cloud that often consists of sensitive patient-related information, privacy is amajor challenge. Adequate protection of patients' privacy helps to increase public trust in medical research. Additionally, DL-based models are complex, and in a cloud-based approach, efficient data processing in such models is complicated. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient and secure cancer diagnostic framework for histopathological image classification by utilizing both differential privacy and secure multi-party computation. For efficient computation, instead of performing the whole operation on the cloud, we decouple the layers into two modules: one for feature extraction using the VGGNet16 module at the user side and the remaining layers for private prediction over the cloud. The efficacy of the framework is validated on two datasets composed of histopathological images of the canine mammary tumor and human breast cancer. The application of differential privacy preserving to the proposed model makes the model secure and capable of preserving the privacy of sensitive data from any adversary, without significantly compromising the model accuracy. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model efficiently achieves the trade-off between privacy and model performance.

AB  - Flexible biomimetic sensors have encountered a bottleneck of sensitivity and durability, as the sensors must directly work within complex body fluid with ultra-trace biomarkers. In this work, a wearable electrochemical sensor on a modified silk fibroin substrate is developed using gold nanoparticles hosted into N-doped porous carbonizated silk fibroin (AuNPs@CSF) as active materials. Taking advantage of the inherent biocompatibility and flexibility of CSF, and the high stability and enzyme-like catalytic activity of AuNPs, AuNPs@CSF-based sensor exhibits durable stability and superior sensitivity to monitor H2O2 released from cancer cell (4T1) and glucose in sweat. The detection limits for H2O2 and glucose are low to be 1.88 mu M and 23 mu M respectively, and the sensor can be applied in succession within 30 days at room temperature. Further, physical cross-linking of polyurethane (PU) with SF well matches with the skin tissue mechanically and provides a flexible, robust and stable electrode-tissue interface. AuNPs@CSF is applied successfully for wearable electrochemical monitoring of glucose in human sweat.The present AuNPs@CSF will possess a potential application in clinical diagnosing of H2O2- or glucose-related diseases in future.

AB  - Elevated asleep heart rate (HR) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and other-cause morbidity and mortality. We assessed the accuracy of Fitbit Inc. PurePulse (R) photoplethysmography with reference to three-lead electrocardiography (ECG) in determining HR during sleep. HR of 35 (17 female) healthy adults 25.1 +/- 10.6 years of age (mean +/- SD) was continuously recorded throughout a single night of sleep. There was no significant difference in asleep HR mean (0.09 beats per minute [bpm], P = 0.426) between Fitbit photoplethysmography and ECG; plus, there was excellent intraclass correlation (0.998) and narrow Bland-Altman agreement range (2.67 bpm). The regression analysis of Bland-Altman plot of mean asleep HR indicates Fitbit tends to slightly overestimate reference values in the lower range of HR (HR < 50 bpm) by 0.51 bpm and slightly underestimate reference values in the higher range of HR (HR > 80 bpm) by 0.63 bpm. Mixed model analysis of epoch-by-epoch (5-min epochs) asleep HR showed significant "U" shape trend (P < 0.001) in amount of Fitbit error (absolute amount of difference between ECG and Fitbit values regardless of overestimation or underestimation) in regard to HR, i.e. smaller error in the medium range of HR (60-80 bpm) and slightly larger error for lower (<60 bpm) and higher (>80 bpm) ranges of HR. However, effect of age, body mass index, gender, and subjective sleep quality measured by Pittsburgh sleep quality index (good/poor sleepers) on error in estimating HR by the Fitbit method was not significant. It is concluded that Fitbit photoplethysmography suitably tracks HR during sleep in healthy young adults.

AB  - The widespread use of cardiac implantable electronic devices and wearable monitors has led to the detection of subclinical atrial fibrillation in a substantial proportion of patients. There is evidence that these asymptomatic arrhythmias are associated with increased risk of stroke. Thus, detection of subclinical atrial fibrillation may offer an opportunity to reduce stroke risk by initiating anticoagulation. However, it is unknown whether long-term anticoagulation is warranted and in what populations. This scientific statement explores the existing data on the prevalence, clinical significance, and management of subclinical atrial fibrillation and identifies current gaps in knowledge and areas of controversy and consensus.

AB  - Caring for people with dementia imposes significant stress on family members and caregivers. Often, these informal caregivers have no coping strategy to deal with these behaviors. Anxiety and stress episodes are often triggered by problematic behaviors exhibited by the person who suffers from dementia. Detecting these behaviors could help them in dealing with them and reduce caregiver burden. However, work on anxiety detection using physiological signals has mostly been done under controlled conditions. In this paper we describe an experiment aimed at inducing anxiety among caregivers of people with dementia under naturalistic conditions. We report an experiment, using the naturalistic enactment technique, in which 10 subjects were asked to care for an older adult who acts as if she experiences dementia. We record physiological signals from the participants (GSR, HR, EEG) during the sessions that lasted for approximately 30 min. We explain how we obtained ground truth from self-report and observation data. We conducted two different tests using the Support Vector Machine technique. We obtained an average precision of 77.8 % and 38.1 % recall when classifying two different possible states: "Anxious" and "Not anxious". Analysis of the data provides evidence that the experiment elicits state anxiety and that it can be detected using wearable sensors. Furthermore, if episodes of problematic behaviors can also be detected, the recognition of anxiety in the caregiver can be improved, leading to the enactment of appropriate interventions to help caregivers cope with anxiety episodes.

AB  - BackgroundFreezing of gait (FOG) is an unpredictable gait arrest that hampers the lives of 40% of people with Parkinson's disease. Because the symptom is heterogeneous in phenotypical presentation (it can present as trembling/shuffling, or akinesia) and manifests during various circumstances (it can be triggered by e.g. turning, passing doors, and dual-tasking), it is particularly difficult to detect with motion sensors. The freezing index (FI) is one of the most frequently used accelerometer-based methods for FOG detection. However, it might not adequately distinguish FOG from voluntary stops, certainly for the akinetic type of FOG. Interestingly, a previous study showed that heart rate signals could distinguish FOG from stopping and turning movements. This study aimed to investigate for which phenotypes and evoking circumstances the FI and heart rate might provide reliable signals for FOG detection.MethodsSixteen people with Parkinson's disease and daily freezing completed a gait trajectory designed to provoke FOG including turns, narrow passages, starting, and stopping, with and without a cognitive or motor dual-task. We compared the FI and heart rate of 378 FOG events to baseline levels, and to stopping and normal gait events (i.e. turns and narrow passages without FOG) using mixed-effects models. We specifically evaluated the influence of different types of FOG (trembling vs akinesia) and triggering situations (turning vs narrow passages; no dual-task vs cognitive dual-task vs motor dual-task) on both outcome measures.ResultsThe FI increased significantly during trembling and akinetic FOG, but increased similarly during stopping and was therefore not significantly different from FOG. In contrast, heart rate change during FOG was for all types and during all triggering situations statistically different from stopping, but not from normal gait events.ConclusionWhen the power in the locomotion band (0.5-3 Hz) decreases, the FI increases and is unable to specify whether a stop is voluntary or involuntary (i.e. trembling or akinetic FOG). In contrast, the heart rate can reveal whether there is the intention to move, thus distinguishing FOG from stopping. We suggest that the combination of a motion sensor and a heart rate monitor may be promising for future FOG detection.

AB  - Authentications using biometrics, such as fingerprint recognition and electrocardiogram (ECG), have been actively used in various applications. Unlike traditional authentication methods, such as passwords or PINs, biometric-based authentication has an advantage in terms of security owing to its capability of liveness detection. Among the various types of biometrics, ECG-based authentication is widely utilized in many fields. Because of the inherent characteristics of ECG, however, the incautious design of ECG-based authentication may result in serious leakage of personal private information. In this paper, we extensively investigate ECG-based authentication schemes previously proposed in the literature and analyze possible privacy leakages by employing machine learning and deep learning techniques. We found that most schemes suffer from vulnerabilities that lead to the leakage of personal information, such as gender, age, and even diseases. We also identified some privacy-insensitive ECG fiducial points by utilizing feature selection algorithms. Based on these features, we present a privacy-preserving ECG-based authentication scheme.

AB  - Breast cancer is one of the worst illnesses, with a higher fatality rate among women globally. Breast cancer detection needs accurate mammography interpretation and analysis, which is challenging for radiologists owing to the intricate anatomy of the breast and low image quality. Advances in deep learning-based models have significantly improved breast lesions' detection, localization, risk assessment, and categorization. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based convolutional neural network (ConvNet) that significantly reduces human error in diagnosing breast malignancy tissues. Our methodology is most effective in eliciting task-specific features, as feature learning is coupled with classification tasks to achieve higher performance in automatically classifying the suspicious regions in mammograms as benign and malignant. To evaluate the model's validity, 322 raw mammogram images from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) and 580 from Private datasets were obtained to extract in-depth features, the intensity of information, and the high likelihood of malignancy. Both datasets are magnificently improved through preprocessing, synthetic data augmentation, and transfer learning techniques to attain the distinctive combination of breast tumors. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed approach achieved remarkable training accuracy of 0.98, test accuracy of 0.97, high sensitivity of 0.99, and an AUC of 0.99 in classifying breast masses on mammograms. The developed model achieved promising performance that helps the clinician in the speedy computation of mammography, breast masses diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of disease progression. Moreover, it has the immense potential over retrospective approaches in consistency feature extraction and precise lesions classification.

AB  - Federated learning (FL) is an effective paradigm for training a machine-learning model based on data distributed at a large quantity of users in Internet of Things (IoT) without sharing their raw data. However, federated optimization of the global model in heterogeneous IoT-while considering the heterogeneity among users and limited network constraints-remains to be an open challenge. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive federated optimization algorithm, Adp-FedProx, to achieve the optimal learning performance within the limited computation and communication resources at the edge. In particular, we analyze how the training loss is affected by each user's global update frequency and the time and energy used for learning by obtaining the novel convergence bound of federated training loss in heterogeneous IoT. With our proposed algorithm, all users can dynamically adjust their number of local iterations in each global interval and will not drop out during the training process for resource exhaustion, so as to impair the negative effect of heterogeneity among users and guarantee the convergence of the training model. In addition, we can get the optimal learning performance by minimizing the gap between the final loss function and the optimal one within limited resources. Finally, extensive numerical results demonstrate the algorithmic advantages in adapting system heterogeneity and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies in speeding up FL 5%-10% and reduce the energy consumption in training about 10% compared with FedProx.

AB  - Introduction Exercise and physical activity (PA) are fundamental to the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Current exercise and PA strategies for newly diagnosed individuals with type 2 diabetes are either clinically effective but unsuitable in routine practice (supervised exercise) or suitable in routine practice but clinically ineffective (PA advice). Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, offering biometric data to patients and healthcare professionals, may bridge the gap between supervised exercise and PA advice, enabling patients to engage in regular long-term physically active lifestyles. This feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the use of mHealth technology when incorporated into a structured home-based exercise and PA intervention, in those recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods and analysis This feasibility multicentre, parallel group RCT will recruit 120 individuals with type 2 diabetes (diagnosis within 5-24 months, aged 40-75 years) in the UK (n=60) and Canada (n=60). Participants will undertake a 6-month structured exercise and PA intervention and be supported by an exercise specialist (active control). The intervention group will receive additional support from a smartwatch and phone app, providing real-time feedback and enabling improved communication between the exercise specialist and participant. Primary outcomes are recruitment rate, adherence to exercise and loss to follow-up. Secondary outcomes include a qualitative process evaluation and piloting of potential clinical outcome measures for a future RCT.
   Ethics and dissemination The trial was approved in the UK by the South East Scotland Research Ethics Committee 01 (20/SS/0101) and in Canada by the Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia (H20-01936), and is being conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific meetings.

If feasible, these sensors offer a low-cost low-maintenance method for assessing HR response in this setting. We determined feasibility of wearable sensors for assessing HR response to daytime therapy activities in inpatient rehabilitation within a cardiorespiratory training zone equal to 55-80% of maximal HR (target HR [THR]) for at least two 10-min bouts, 3-5 days per week. Secondarily, we determined episodes of excessive HR (EHR >80% of maximal HR).Materials and Methods:Subjects 44-80 years of age with diagnoses of stroke, cardiac disorders, orthopedic disorders, medically complex conditions, or pulmonary disorders wore wrist-mounted HR sensors day and night throughout inpatient rehabilitation. The proportion of subjects meeting THR thresholds and experiencing EHR episodes was quantified. Multiple regression predicted THR and EHR outcomes from age, sex, length of stay, and motor function at admission and discharge.Results:Across subjects, 97,800min of HR data were analyzed. Sixty percent of subjects met THR thresholds for cardiorespiratory benefit. Age was the single significant predictor of percent of days meeting the THR threshold (R=0.58, p=0.024). Forty-seven percent of subjects experienced EHR episodes on at least 1 day. No subjects experienced sensor-related adverse events, and no protocol deviations occurred from inadvertent sensor removal.Conclusions:Most subjects experienced HR increases sufficient to obtain cardiorespiratory benefit. Likewise, most subjects had episodes of EHR. Wearable sensors were feasible for continuously assessing HR response, suggesting expanded opportunity in inpatient rehabilitation research and treatment.

AB  - Polysomnography (PSG) is the current gold standard in high-resolution sleep monitoring; however, this method is obtrusive, expensive, and time-consuming. Conversely, commercially available wrist monitors such as ActiWatch can monitor sleep for multiple days and at low cost, but often overestimate sleep and cannot differentiate between sleep stages, such as rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM. Wireless wearable sensors are a promising alternative for their portability and access to high-resolution data for customizable analytics. We present a multimodal sensor system measuring hand acceleration, electrocardiography, and distal skin temperature that outperforms the ActiWatch, detecting wake and sleep with a recall of 74.4% and 90.0%, respectively, as well as wake, non-REM, and REM with recall of 73.3%, 59.0%, and 56.0%, respectively. This approach will enable clinicians and researchers to more easily, accurately, and inexpensively assess long-term sleep patterns, diagnose sleep disorders, and monitor risk factors for disease in both laboratory and home settings.

TI  - Sensor-based surveillance for digitising real-time COVID-19 tracking in the USA (DETECT): a multivariable, populationbased, modelling study
T2  - LANCET DIGITAL HEALTH

AB  - Background Traditional viral illness surveillance relies on in-person clinical or laboratory data, paper-based data collection, and outdated technology for data transfer and aggregation. We aimed to assess whether continuous sensor data can provide an early warning signal for COVID-19 activity as individual physiological and behavioural changes might precede symptom onset, care seeking, and diagnostic testing.
   Methods This multivariable, population-based, modelling study recruited adult (aged >= 18 years) participants living in the USA who had a smartwatch or fitness tracker on any device that connected to Apple HealthKit or Google Fit and had joined the DETECT study by downloading the MyDataHelps app. In the model development cohort, we included people who had participated in DETECT between April 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022. In the validation cohort, we included individuals who had participated between Jan 15 and Feb 15, 2022. When a participant joins DETECT, they fill out an intake survey of demographic information, including their ZIP code (postal code), and surveys on symptoms, symptom onset, and viral illness test dates and results, if they become unwell. When a participant connects their device, historical sensor data are collected, if available. Sensor data continue to be collected unless a participant withdraws from the study. Using sensor data, we collected each participant's daily resting heart rate and step count during the entire study period and identified anomalous sensor days, in which resting heart rate was higher than, and step count was lower than, a specified threshold calculated for each individual by use of their baseline data. The proportion of users with anomalous data each day was used to create a 7-day moving average. For the main cohort, a negative binomial model predicting 7-day moving averages for COVID-19 case counts, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in real time, 6 days in the future, and 12 days in the future in the USA and California was fitted with CDC-reported data from 3 days before alone (H-0) or in combination with anomalous sensor data (H-1). We compared the predictions with Pearson correlation. We then validated the model in the validation cohort.
   Findings Between April 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2022, 35 842 participants enrolled in DETECT, of whom 4006 in California and 28 527 in the USA were included in our main cohort. The H-1 model significantly outperformed the H-0 model in predicting the 7-day moving average COVID-19 case counts in California and the USA. For example, Pearson correlation coefficients for predictions 12 days in the future increased by 32.9% in California (from 0.70 [95% CI 0.65-0.73] to 0.93 [0.92-0.94]) and by 12.2% (from 0.82 [0.79-0.84] to 0.92 [0.91-0.93]) in the USA from the H-0 model to the H-1 model. Our validation model also showed significant correlations for predictions in real time, 6 days in the future, and 12 days in the future.
   Interpretation Our study showed that passively collected sensor data from consenting participants can provide real-time disease tracking and forecasting. With a growing population of wearable technology users, these sensor data could be integrated into viral surveillance programmes. Copyright (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - IoT has facilitated predominant advancements in cancer research by incorporating Artificial intelligence (AI) that enables human decision-makers to achieve a better decision. Recently, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) classifier has launched in predicting recurrence cancer genes in the cervix. At the initial phase, the recurrence gene expression of lncRNA is collected from Geo Datasets. Secondly, data imputation, accomplished with Mode and Mean Missing method (MMM-DI). Thirdly, feature selection is compassed using Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion with Diversity based Artificial Fish Swarm (HSDAFS). In the HSDA.FS algorithm, the diversity parameter is added based on the gene value, and their risk score of the lncRNAs is computed using the Artificial intelligence (AI) technique. Finally, recurrence prediction, an ENSemble Classification Framework (ENSCF), is proposed based on recurrent neural networks. The prognostic factor is computed with a risk score of nine lncRNA signatures for 300 samples taken from GSE44001. The Chi-Square method has been used to obtain statistical results. The survival of the patient with recurrence cervical cancer is shown using the proposed model.

AB  - Objective. Detection and early prediction of mental fatigue (i.e. shifts in vigilance), could be used to adapt neuromodulation strategies to effectively treat patients suffering from brain injury and other indications with prominent chronic mental fatigue. Approach. In this study, we analyzed electrocorticography (ECoG) signals chronically recorded from two healthy non-human primates (NHP) as they performed a sustained attention task over extended periods of time. We employed a set of spectrotemporal and connectivity biomarkers of the ECoG signals to identify periods of mental fatigue and a gradient boosting classifier to predict performance, up to several seconds prior to the behavioral response. Main results. Wavelet entropy and the instantaneous amplitude and frequency were among the best single features across sessions in both NHPs. The classification performance using higher order spectral-temporal (HOST) features was significantly higher than that of conventional spectral power features in both NHPs. Across the 99 sessions analyzed, average F1 scores of 77.5% +/- 8.2% and 91.2% +/- 3.6%, and accuracy of 79.5% +/- 8.9% and 87.6% +/- 3.9% for the classifier were obtained for each animal, respectively. Significance. Our results here demonstrate the feasibility of predicting performance and detecting periods of mental fatigue by analyzing ECoG signals, and that this general approach, in principle, could be used for closed-loop control of neuromodulation strategies.

AB  - In general, heart disease is considered as the most severe disease that results in high mortality rate globally. An arrhythmia is one type of heart disease caused due to asymmetrical heartbeat rhythm rate (i.e., heartbeat will be too slow or too fast). The generation of IoT devices as well as ECG signals is capable of tracking the heart rhythm of the patients consistently. Even though, analyzing ECG signals using cloud-based techniques achieves a certain accuracy level with high latency. Then by evaluating the ECG signals with fog-based approaches minimizes the latency but the computing capability is minimum. Therefore, wearable devices and fog devices are linked directly to attain high service quality with minimum latency. To conquer such drawbacks, this article proposes a novel AdaBoost kernel support vector machine-based remora optimization (AKSVM based RO) algorithm to analyze the ECG signals and to initiate the crisis with minimum time delay. The proposed approach predicts the ECG signals of arrhythmia affected persons from an IoT wearable device. In addition to this, the proposed AKSVM-RO approach is more feasible to deploy in fog environment. Also, it assists in optimizing the time delay in calling the ambulance service during emergency situations. Finally, the experimental investigations are conducted for various approaches with respect to simulation measures to minimize the latency and accuracy of the proposed system.

AB  - The Internet of things (IoT) has been a controversial domain of inquiry in engineering applications since the term was first introduced in 2000. The emergence of IoT also promotes the advancement of health care monitoring from face-to-face consultation to telemedicine or eHealth system. This paper presents the prototyping of an embedded health care monitoring system based on the IoT paradigm. The proposed system architecture consists of three sensors for the measurement of three basic vital signs, i.e. body temperature, pulse rate, and blood pressure. The integrated sensors are interfaced with the Intel Edison platform, and the output readings are transferred to IBM Bluemix for cloud storage and display. Taking advantage of IoT, the condition of the physical body can be monitored remotely and diagnosed with anomalies by doctors. The paper also presents the health care analytical framework related to diabetes and kidney disease. The prediction results from the analytics show the potential of the classification model to be integrated into the proposed system to identify the potential risk of certain diseases at early stages of early treatment. In the preliminary investigation, the accuracy of the developed model to differentiate between a healthy person and patients with diabetes and kidney disease is 90.54% and 87.88%, respectively. Concerning the functionality of the proposed system architecture, the sensors' measurement accuracy is above 90% compared to conventional medical equipment.

AB  - Recognition of breathing patterns helps clinicians to understand acute and chronic adaptations during exercise and pathological conditions. Wearable technologies combined with a proper data analysis provide a low cost option to monitor chest and abdominal wall movements. Here we set out to determine the feasibility of using accelerometry and machine learning to detect chest-abdominal wall movement patterns during tidal breathing. Furthermore, we determined the accelerometer positions included in the clusters, considering principal component domains. Eleven healthy participants (age: 21 +/- 0.2 y, BMI: 23.4 +/- 0.7 kg/m(2), FEV1: 4.1 +/- 0.3 L, VO2: 4.6 +/- 0.2 mL/min kg) were included in this cross-sectional study. Spirometry and ergospirometry assessments were performed with participants seated with 13 accelerometers placed over the thorax. Data collection lasted 10 min. Following signal pre-processing, principal components and clustering analyses were performed. The Euclidean distances in respect to centroids were compared between the clusters (p < 0.05), identifying two clusters (p < 0.001). The first cluster included sensors located at the right and left second rib midline, body of sternum, left fourth rib midline, right and left second thoracic vertebra midline, and fifth thoracic vertebra. The second cluster included sensors at the fourth right rib midline, right and left seventh ribs, abdomen at linea alba, and right and left tenth thoracic vertebra midline. Costal-superior and costal-abdominal patterns were also recognized. We conclude that accelerometers placed on the chest and abdominal wall permit the identification of two clusters of movements regarding respiration biomechanics.

AB  - The identification of fatigue in personal workers in particular environments can be achieved through early warning techniques. In order to prevent excessive fatigue of medical workers staying in infected areas in the early phase of the coronavirus disease pandemic, a system of low-load wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) devices was used as intelligent acquisition terminals to perform a continuous measurement ECG collection. While machine learning (ML) algorithms and heart rate variability (HRV) offer the promise of fatigue detection for many, there is a demand for ever-increasing reliability in this area, especially in real-life activities. This study proposes a random forest-based classification ML model to identify the four categories of fatigue levels in frontline medical workers using HRV. Based on the wavelet transform in ECG signal processing, stationary wavelet transform was applied to eliminate the main perturbation of ECG in the motion state. Feature selection was performed using ReliefF weighting analysis in combination with redundancy analysis to optimize modeling accuracy. The experimental results of the overall fatigue identification achieved an accuracy of 97.9% with an AUC value of 0.99. With the four-category identification model, the accuracy is 85.6%. These results proved that fatigue analysis based on low-load wearable ECG monitoring at low exertion can accurately determine the level of fatigue of caregivers and provide further ideas for researchers working on fatigue identification in special environments.

LA  - English
AB  - The ubiquitous usage of wearable IoT (wIoT) devices has created a formidable opportunity for remote health monitoring system to provide paramount services such as preventive care and early intervention for populations at risk. The cloud-edge paradigm can efficiently manifest the complex computations required in providing these services. But the challenge in its exertion lies in incorporating intelligence at the edge devices. With the deluge of data availability, deep learning methods are very promising to obtain sufficient performance in healthcare applications. As the edge devices are resourceconstrained in terms of compute capability and energy consumption, unleashing deep learning services from the cloud to the edge requires efficient tackling of the exorbitant computational and energy requirements of deep learning frameworks. In this chapter, an energy-efficient smart edge based health care support system (EESE-HSS) is proposed for diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease. The proposed cloud-edge paradigm makes use of a hierarchical computing architecture for exerting expeditious diagnosis during emergencies. The intelligence framework incorporated at the edge is also built in an energy-efficient manner. Thus, the proposed healthcare support system has better efficacy in terms of energy efficiency and reduced latency. This makes it very supportive for fall detection in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease who are susceptible to the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other vicious diseases.

AB  - Although heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a common clinical syndrome and can be modified by the administration of appropriate medical therapy, there is no adequate tool available to perform reliable, economical, early-stage screening. To meet this need, we developed an interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for HFrEF screening using electrocardiography (ECG) and validated its performance. This retrospective cohort study included two hospitals. An AI algorithm based on a convolutional neural network was developed using 39,371 ECG results from 17,127 patients. The internal validation included 3,470 ECGs from 2,908 patients. Furthermore, we conducted external validation using 4,362 ECGs from 4,176 patients from another hospital to verify the applicability of the algorithm across different centers. The end-point was to detect HFrEF, defined as an ejection fraction <40%. We also visualized the regions in 12 lead ECG that affected HFrEF detection in the AI algorithm and compared this to the previously documented literature. During the internal and external validation, the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a 12 lead ECG for detecting HFrEF were 0.913 (95% confidence interval, 0.902-0.925) and 0.961 (0.951-0.971), respectively, and the areas under the curves of the AI algorithm using a single-lead ECG were 0.874 (0.859-0.890) and 0.929 (0.911-0.946), respectively. The deep learning-based AI algorithm performed HFrEF detection well using not only a 12 lead but also a single-lead ECG. These results suggest that HFrEF can be screened not only using a 12 lead ECG, as is typical of a conventional ECG machine, but also with a single-lead ECG performed by a wearable device employing the AI algorithm, thereby preventing irreversible disease progression and mortality.

AB  - Growing concern for falls in acute care settings could be addressed with objective evaluation of fall risk. The current proof-of-concept study evaluated the feasibility of using a chest-worn sensor during hospitalization to determine fall risk. Physical activity and heart rate variability (HRV) of 31 volunteers admitted to a 29-bed adult inpatient unit were recorded using a single chest-worn sensor. Sensor data during the first 24-hour recording were analyzed. Participants were stratified using the Hendrich II fall risk assessment into high and low fall risk groups. Univariate analysis revealed age, daytime activity, night-time side lying posture, and HRV were significantly different between groups. Results suggest feasibility of wearable technology to consciously monitor physical activity, sleep postures, and HRV as potential markers of fall risk in the acute care setting. Further study is warranted to confirm the results and examine the efficacy of the proposed wearable technology to manage falls in hospitals.

AB  - In this work, a wearable clinical prototype with patient interface for microwave breast cancer detection is designed. It operates in the 2-4 GHz range and contains 16 wideband sensors embedded in a hemispherical dielectric radome. The cancer cell of size below 5 mm are detected and measured from breast phantom. The subsequent scan acts as a calibration signal and the skin reflections will be suppressed if the skin contour remains consistent throughout the rotation. However, the scattering response from within the breast also becomes distorted in the process as twin targets are often reconstructed from single scatterers and significant targets located near the axis of rotation are often eliminated. The proposed work designed to perform multistatic signal calibration with minimal distortion of internal breast scatterers; The proposed work offers superior tumor identification, accurate localization, and strong artifact resistance over existing wavelet algorithms. In this paper we investigate how signal processing can be accelerated for diagnosis by using NN. The various scenarios: homogenous and heterogeneous breast models with varied densities, combining both ideal and practical signal analysis methods were taken. Extensive simulations and analyses using backscattered signals received from wearable breast models were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. From the results, we can measure the cell with 95.6% in accuracy.

AB  - Wearable devices have been increasingly used in research to provide continuous physical activity monitoring, but how to effectively extract features remains challenging for researchers. To analyze the generated actigraphy data in large-scale population studies, we developed computationally efficient methods to derive sleep and activity features through a Hidden Markov Model-based sleep/wake identification algorithm, and circadian rhythm features through a Penalized Multi-band Learning approach adapted from machine learning. Unsupervised feature extraction is useful when labeled data are unavailable, especially in large-scale population studies. We applied these two methods to the UK Biobank wearable device data and used the derived sleep and circadian features as phenotypes in genome-wide association studies. We identified 53 genetic loci with p<5x10(-8)including genes known to be associated with sleep disorders and circadian rhythms as well as novel loci associated with Body Mass Index, mental diseases and neurological disorders, which suggest shared genetic factors of sleep and circadian rhythms with physical and mental health. Further cross-tissue enrichment analysis highlights the important role of the central nervous system and the shared genetic architecture with metabolism-related traits and the metabolic system. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of our unsupervised methods for wearable device data when additional training data cannot be easily acquired, and our study further expands the application of wearable devices in population studies and genetic studies to provide novel biological insights.
   Author summary While wearable devices have been increasingly used in research for objective and continuous activity monitoring, how to effectively extract sleep and rest-activity circadian rhythm features remains the major obstacle for researchers, especially in population studies where labeled outcome data such as sleep diaries are unavailable and thus existing supervised methods cannot be applied. Here, we developed unsupervised feature extraction methods based on machine learning without the need for labeled outcome data. We applied the methods to population wearable device data to extract sleep and circadian features, and we further identified novel associated loci and the key roles of the central nervous system and the metabolic system. The findings are essential for understanding the underlying shared genetic architecture of sleep and circadian rhythms with physical and mental health, and the proposed methods can largely expand and promote the use of wearable device data in population and genetic studies.

AB  - Now-a-days the most common pretentious disease is the lung cancer, which has become more prevalent in the world that primarily infects the pulmonary nodules of the lungs. At present the most propitious way to increase survival rate in cancer patients is by early detection. Commonly the lung cancer is diagnosed by radiologists with an inclusive analysis of CT images, which proceeds comprehensively a longer time. The analysis of lung cancer in imaging modalities like CT images is crucial. Image processing itself act as a progressive diagnostic tool for analysis of medical imaging modalities. The existing procedures for detection of lung cancer like PSO with morphological yields poor accuracy. In this work the novelty is established by considering cuckoo-search optimization algorithm along with ostu threshold for segmentation, CNN as classifier and LBP as feature extraction procedure on CT images for detection of lung cancer. In addition, IoT technology is carried out using raspberry PI processor to establish a network to share the details among the medical professionals to exchange opinions for final treatment. Finally, various parameters were calculated and compared with existing procedures especially accuracy is around 98% and MSE within 1.5 is obtained. Thus, the proposed method gives an optimal solution on comparison with respect to all the parameters.

AB  - Background: Aging may result in autonomic nervous dysfunction. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a non-invasive method to measure autonomic nervous activities. Many studies have shown that HRV contributes to the risk assessment of diseases. A Polar V800 heart rate monitor is a wearable device that measures R-R intervals, but has only been validated in younger adults under limited testing conditions. There is no validation of the V800 under mental stress or in dual task testing conditions. Therefore, this study investigated the validity of the Polar V800 heart rate monitor for assessing R-R intervals and evaluated if there were differences on HRV parameters under different situations in community-dwelling elderly adults. Methods: Forty community-dwelling elderly adults were recruited. Heart rates were recorded via electrocardiogram (ECG) and the V800 under sitting, during an arithmetic test, during a naming test, a self-selected walking velocity test (SSWV), and dual tasks (SSWV performing mental arithmetic test and SSWV performing naming test). Indices of time and frequency domains of HRV were calculated afterwards. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis and effect size were calculated to examine the concurrent validity between the V800 and the ECG. Results: All HRV indices from the V800 were highly correlated with the ECG under all tested conditions (ICC = 0.995-1.000, p < 0.001) and the effect size of bias was small (<0.1). Conclusion: Overall, the V800 has good validity on the assessment of HRV in community-dwelling elderly adults during sitting, mental arithmetic test, naming test, SSWV, and dual tasks.

AB  - Background: Change of the corrected flow time (Ftc) is a surrogate for tracking stroke volume (SV) in the intensive care unit. Multiple Ftc equations have been proposed; many have not had their diagnostic characteristics for detecting SV change reported. Further, little is known about the inherent Ftc variability induced by the respiratory cycle.
   Materials and methods: Using a wearable Doppler ultrasound patch, we studied the clinical performance of 11 Ftc equations to detect a 10% change in SV measured by non-invasive pulse contour analysis; 26 healthy volunteers performed a standardized cardiac preload modifying maneuver.
   Results: One hundred changes in cardiac preload and 3890 carotid beats were analyzed. Most of the 11 Ftc equations studied had similar diagnostic attributes. Wodeys' and Chambers' formulae had identical results; a 2% change in Ftc detected a 10% change in SV with a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 93%, respectively. Similarly, a 3% change in Ftc calculated by Bazett's formula displayed a sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 93%. Ftc(Wodey)had 100% concordance and anR(2)of 0.75 with change in SV; these values were 99%, 0.76 and 98%, 0.71 for Ftc(Chambers)and Ftc(Bazetts), respectively. As an exploratory analysis, we studied 3335 carotid beats for the dispersion of Ftc during quiet breathing using the equations of Wodey and Bazett. The coefficient of variation of Ftc during quiet breathing for these formulae were 0.06 and 0.07, respectively.
   Conclusions: Most of the 11 different equations used to calculate carotid artery Ftc from a wearable Doppler ultrasound patch had similar thresholds and abilities to detect SV change in healthy volunteers. Variation in Ftc induced by the respiratory cycle is important; measuring a clinically significant change in Ftc with statistical confidence requires a large sample of beats.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) environments produce large amounts of data that are challenging to analyze. The most challenging aspect is reducing the quantity of consumed resources and time required to retrain a machine learning model as new data records arrive. Therefore, for big data analytics in IoT environments where datasets are highly dynamic, evolving over time, it is highly advised to adopt an online (also called incremental) machine learning model that can analyze incoming data instantaneously, rather than an offline model (also called static), that should be retrained on the entire dataset as new records arrive. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce the Incremental Ant-Miner (IAM), a machine learning algorithm for online prediction based on one of the most well-established machine learning algorithms, Ant-Miner. IAM classifier tackles the challenge of reducing the time and space overheads associated with the classic offline classifiers, when used for online prediction. IAM can be exploited in managing dynamic environments to ensure timely and space-efficient prediction, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure scores. To show its effectiveness, the proposed IAM was run on six different datasets from different domains, namely horse colic, credit cards, flags, ionosphere, and two breast cancer datasets. The performance of the proposed model was compared to ten state-of-the-art classifiers: naive Bayes, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, K*, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), bagging, Projective Adaptive Resonance Theory (PART), decision tree (C4.5), and random forest. The experimental results illustrate the superiority of IAM as it outperformed all the benchmarks in nearly all performance measures. Additionally, IAM only needs to be rerun on the new data increment rather than the entire big dataset on the arrival of new data records, which makes IAM better in time- and resource-saving. These results demonstrate the strong potential and efficiency of the IAM classifier for big data analytics in various areas.

AB  - Presence of speech and motion artifacts has been shown to impact the performance of wearable sensor systems used for automatic detection of food intake. This work presents a novel wearable device which can detect food intake even when the user is physically active and/or talking. The device consists of a piezoelectric strain sensor placed on the temporalis muscle, an accelerometer, and a data acquisition module connected to the temple of eyeglasses. Data from 10 participants was collected while they performed activities including quiet sitting, talking, eating while sitting, eating while walking, and walking. Piezoelectric strain sensor and accelerometer signals were divided into non-overlapping epochs of 3 s; four features were computed for each signal. To differentiate between eating and not eating, as well as between sedentary postures and physical activity, two multiclass classification approaches are presented. The first approach used a single classifier with sensor fusion and the second approach used two-stage classification. The best results were achieved when two separate linear support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained for food intake and activity detection, and their results were combined using a decision tree (two-stage classification) to determine the final class. This approach resulted in an average F1-score of 99.85% and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 for multiclass classification. With its ability to differentiate between food intake and activity level, this device may potentially be used for tracking both energy intake and energy expenditure.

AB  - Wearable sensors that can conveniently detect cytokine levels in human biofluids are essential for assisting hospitals to maximize the benefits of anti-inflammatory therapies and avoid cytokine storms. Measurement of cytokine levels in biofluids still remains challenging for existing sensors due to high interference from the background. Here, this challenge is overcome through developing a flexible and regenerative aptameric field-effect transistor biosensor, consisting of a graphene-Nafion composite film, for detecting cytokine storm biomarkers in undiluted human biofluids. The composite film enables the minimization of nonspecific adsorption and empowers the renewability to the biosensor. With these capabilities, the device is capable of consistently and sensitively monitoring cytokines (e.g., IFN-gamma, an inflammatory and cancer biomarker) in undiluted human sweat with a detection range from 0.015 to 250 nmand limit of detection down to 740 fm. The biosensor is also shown to incur no visible mechanical damage and maintain a consistent sensing response throughout the regenerative (up to 80 cycles) and crumpling (up to 100 cycles) tests. Experimental results demonstrate that the biosensor is expected to offer opportunities for developing wearable biosensing systems for distinguishing acute infectious disease patients and monitoring of patients' health conditions in daily life.

AB  - Stair ascent is a challenging daily-life activity highly related to independence. This task is usually assessed with clinical scales suffering from partial subjectivity and limited detail in evaluating different task aspects. In this paper, we instrumented the assessment of stair ascent in people with multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke (ST), and Parkinson's disease (PD) to analyze the validity of the proposed quantitative indexes and characterize subjects' performances. Participants climbed 10 steps wearing a magneto-inertial sensor [magneto-inertial measurement unit (MIMU)] at sternum level. Gait pattern features (step frequency, symmetry, regularity, and harmonic ratios), and upper trunk sway were computed from MIMU signals. Clinical modified dynamic gait index (mDGI) and mDGI-Item 8 "Up stairs" were administered. Significant correlations with clinical scores were found for gait pattern features (r(s) >= 0.536) and trunk pitch sway (r(s) <= -0.367) demonstrating their validity. Instrumental indexes showed alterations in the three pathological groups compared to healthy subjects and significant differences, not clinically detected, among MS, ST, and PD. MS showed the worst performance, with alterations of all gait pattern aspects and larger trunk pitch sway. ST showed worsening in gait pattern features but not in trunk motion. PD showed fewer alterations consisting in reduced step frequency and trunk yaw sway. These results suggest that the use of an MIMU provided valid objective indexes revealing between-group differences in stair ascent not detected by clinical scales. Importantly, the indexes include upper trunk measures, usually not present in clinical tests, and provide relevant hints for tailored rehabilitation.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of heart and blood vessel disorders that is one of the most serious dangers to human health, and the number of such patients is still growing. Early and accurate detection plays a key role in successful treatment and intervention. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for identifying a variety of cardiovascular abnormalities. In clinical practices and most of the current research, standard 12-lead ECG is mainly used. However, using a lower number of leads can make ECG more prevalent as it can be conveniently recorded by portable or wearable devices. In this research, we develop a novel deep learning system to accurately identify multiple cardiovascular abnormalities by using only three ECG leads which are I, II, and V1. Specifically, we use three separate One-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNNs) as backbones to extract features from three input ECG leads separately. The architecture of 1D-CNNs is redesigned for high performance and low computational cost. A novel Lead-wise Attention module is then introduced to aggregate outputs from these three backbones, resulting in a more robust representation which is then passed through a Fully-Connected (FC) layer to perform classification. Moreover, to make the system's prediction clinically explainable, the Grad-CAM technique is modified to produce a highly meaningful lead-wise explanation. Finally, we employ a pruning technique to reduce system size, forcing it suitable for deployment on hardware-constrained platforms. The proposed lightweight, explainable system is named LightX3ECG. We get classification performance in terms of F1 scores of 0.9718 and 0.8004 on two large-scale ECG datasets, i.e., Chapman and CPSC-2018, respectively, which surpass current state-of-the-art methods while achieving higher computational and storage efficiency. Visual examinations and a sanity check are also performed to strictly demonstrate the strength of our system's interpretability.

AB  - Wearable sensors provide an exceptional opportunity in collecting real-time behavioral data in free living conditions. However, wearable sensor data from observational studies often suffer from information bias, since participants' willingness to wear the monitoring devices may be associated with the underlying behavior of interest. The aim of this study was to introduce a semiparametric statistical approach for modeling wearable sensor-based physical activity monitoring data with informative device wear. Our simulation study indicated that estimates from the generalized estimating equations showed ignorable bias when device wear patterns were independent of the participants physical activity process, but incrementally more biased when the patterns of device non-wear times were increasingly associated with the physical activity process. The estimates from the proposed semiparametric modeling approach were unbiased both when the device wear patterns were (i) independent or (ii) dependent to the underlying physical activity process. We demonstrate an application of this method using data from the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ($N=4518$), to examine gender differences in physical activity measured using accelerometers. The semiparametric model can be implemented using our R package acc, free software developed for reading, processing, simulating, visualizing, and analyzing accelerometer data, publicly available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether there are differences in arm, leg and trunk activity measured by acceleration between weekdays and weekends in people undergoing rehabilitation in the subacute stage after stroke.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Patients: Twenty-eight individuals with stroke (mean age 55.4 years; severe to mild impairment) and 10 healthy controls.
   Methods: A set of 5 3-axial accelerometers were used on the trunk, wrists and ankles during 2 48-h sessions at weekdays and over a weekend. Day-time acceleration raw data were expressed as the signal magnitude area. Asymmetry between the affected and less-affected limb was calculated as a ratio.
   Results: Participants with stroke used their both arms and legs less at weekends than on weekdays (p<0.05, effect size 0.3 2-0.5 7). Asymmetry between the affected and less-affected arm was greater at weekends (p < 0.05, effect size 0.32). All activity measures, apart from the less-affected arm on weekdays, were lower in stroke compared with controls (p<0.05, effect size 0.4-0.8). No statistically significant differences were detected between weekday and weekend activity for the control group. One-third of participants perceived the trunk sensor as inconvenient to wear.
   Conclusion: Increased focus needs to be applied on activities carried out during weekends at rehabilitation wards.

AB  - Background: Heart rate (HR) monitored by a wearable device (WD) has demonstrated its clinical feasibility for thyrotoxicosis subjects. However, the association of HR monitored by wearables with hypothyroidism has not been examined. We assessed the association between serum thyroid hormone concentration and three WD-HR parameters in hypothyroid subjects. Methods: Forty-four subjects scheduled for radioactive iodine therapy (RAI Tx) after thyroid cancer surgery were included. Thirty subjects were prepared for RAI Tx by thyroid hormone withdrawal (hypothyroidism group) and 14 subjects by recombinant human thyrotropin (control group). Three WD-HR parameters were calculated from the HR data collected during rest, during sleep, and from 2:00 AM to 6:00 AM, respectively. We analyzed the changes in conventionally measured resting HR (On-site rHR) and WDHR parameters relative to thyroid hormone levels. Results: Serum free thyroxine (T4) levels, On-site rHR, and WD-HR parameters were lower in the hypothyroid group than in the control group at the time of RAI Tx. WD-HR parameters also reflected minute changes in free T4 levels. A decrease in On-site rHR and WD-HR parameters by one standard deviation (On-site rHR, approximately 12 bpm; WD-HR parameters, approximately 8 bpm) was associated with a 0.2 ng/dL decrease in free T4 levels (P<0.01) and a 2-fold increase of the odds ratio of hypothyroidism (P<0.01). WD-HR parameters displayed a better goodness-of-fit measure (lower quasi-information criterion value) than On-site rHR in predicting the hypothyroidism. Conclusion: This study identified WD-HR parameters as informative and easy-to-measure biomarkers to predict hypothyroidism.

AB  - Background: The physical frailty assessment tools that are currently available are often time consuming to use with limited feasibility. Objective: To address these limitations, an instrumented trail-making task (iTMT) platform was developed using wearable technology to automate quantification of frailty phenotypes without the need of a frailty walking test. Methods: Sixty-one older adults (age = 72.8 +/- 9.9 years, body mass index [BMI] = 27.4 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2)) were recruited. According to the Fried Frailty Criteria, 39% of participants were determined as robust and 61% as non-robust (pre-frail or frail). In addition, 17 young subjects (age = 29.0 +/- 7.2 years, BMI = 26.2 +/- 4.6 kg/m(2)) were recruited to determine the healthy benchmark. The iTMT included reaching 5 indexed circles (including numbers 1-to-3 and letters A& B placed in random orders), which virtually appeared on a computer-screen, by rotating one's ankle-joint while standing. By using an ankle-worn inertial sensor, 3D ankle-rotation was estimated and mapped into navigation of a computer-cursor in real-time (100 Hz), allowing subjects to navigate the computer-cursor to perform the iTMT. The ankle-sensor was also used for quantifying ankle-rotation velocity (representing slowness), its decline during the test (representing exhaustion), and ankle-velocity variability (representing movement inefficiency), as well as the power (representing weakness) generated during the test. Comparative assessments included Fried frailty phenotypes and gait assessment. Results: All subjects were able to complete the iTMT, with an average completion time of 125 +/- 85 s. The iTMT-derived parameters were able to identify the presence and absence of slowness, exhaustion, weakness, and inactivity phenotypes (Cohen's d effect size = 0.90-1.40). The iTMT Velocity was significantly different between groups (d = 0.62-1.47). Significant correlation was observed between the iTMT Velocity and gait speed (r = 0.684 p < 0.001). The iTMT-derived parameters and age together enabled significant distinguishing of non-robust cases with area under curve of 0.834, sensitivity of 83%, and specificity of 67%. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a non-gait-based wearable platform to objectively quantify frailty phenotypes and determine physical frailty, using a quick and practical test. This platform may address the hurdles of conventional physical frailty phenotypes methods by replacing the conventional frailty walking test with an automated and objective process that reduces the time of assessment and is more practical for those with mobility limitations.

AB  - Objective monitoring of food intake and ingestive behavior in a free-living environment remains an open problem that has significant implications in study and treatment of obesity and eating disorders. In this paper, a novel wearable sensor system (automatic ingestion monitor, AIM) is presented for objective monitoring of ingestive behavior in free living. The proposed device integrates three sensor modalities that wirelessly interface to a smartphone: a jaw motion sensor, a hand gesture sensor, and an accelerometer. A novel sensor fusion and pattern recognition method was developed for subject-independent food intake recognition. The device and the methodology were validated with data collected from 12 subjects wearing AIM during the course of 24 h in which both the daily activities and the food intake of the subjects were not restricted in any way. Results showed that the system was able to detect food intake with an average accuracy of 89.8%, which suggests that AIM can potentially be used as an instrument to monitor ingestive behavior in free-living individuals.

AB  - Background: Age-related cognitive decline may be delayed with appropriate interventions if those at high risk can be identified prior to clinical symptoms arising. Gait variability assessment has emerged as a promising candidate prognostic indicator, however, it remains unclear how sensitive gait variability is to early changes in cognitive abilities.
   Research question: Do community-dwelling adults over 65 years of age with subjective memory complaints differ from those with no subjective memory concerns in terms of laboratory-measured or free-living gait variability?
   Methods: This cross-sectional study recruited 24 (age = 73.5(SD 6.4) years) community-dwelling people with subjective memory complaints and twenty seven (age = 70.9(4.3) years) individuals with no subjective memory concerns. A sample of 9 individuals with diagnosed mild dementia were also assessed (age = 86.5(7.0) years). Gait variability was assessed in a laboratory during walking at preferred pace (single-task) and while counting backward by seven (dual-task). Sixteen passes over a 4.88 m walkway in each condition were recorded and step length and duration variability was analysed. Free-living gait was assessed with a waist-worn accelerometer by identifying gait bouts of at least one min duration, and the mean multiscale sample entropy in one mins non-overlapping epochs is reported. Statistical inferences were based on analysis of variance using sex and group as the factors.
   Results: No difference between those with subjective memory complaints and those without were observed in either laboratory- or free-living gait variability estimates. Both laboratory- and free-living gait variability were higher in those with mild dementia compared to the other groups.
   Significance: Assuming that subjective memory complaints are on the pathway from cognitively intact to cognitively frail, the findings raise the hypothesis that subjective memory complaints occur earlier in the pathophysiology than measurable changes in laboratory or free living gait. Alternatively the gait variability assessments utilised may have been too insensitive.

AB  - Background: Continuous vital sign monitoring may identify changes sooner than current standard monitoring.
   Objective: To investigate if the use of real-time digital alerts sent to healthcare staff can improve the time taken to identify unwell patients and those with sepsis.
   Design: A prospective cohort study design.
   Setting: West Middlesex University Hospital, UK.
   Participants: Fifty acutely unwell surgical patients admitted to hospital.
   Intervention: Patients wore a lightweight wearable sensor measuring heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and temperature every 2 min whilst standard intermittent ward monitoring of vital signs was performed by nurses. Digital alerts were sent to healthcare staff from the sensor to a smartphone device. All alerts were reviewed for recruited patients to identify the exact time on the sensor in which deterioration occurred. The time to acknowledgement was then reviewed for each action and an average time to acknowledgement calculated.
   Results: There were 50 patients recruited in the pilot study, of which there were vital sign alerts in 18 patients (36%). The total number of vital sign alerts generated in these 18 patients was 51. Of these 51 alerts, there were 7 alerts for high HR (13.7%), 33 for RR (64.7%) and 11 for temperature (21.6%). Out of the 27 acknowledged alerts, there were 2 alerts for HR, 17 for RR and 8 for temperature. The average time to staff acknowledgement of the notification for all alerts was 154 min (2.6 h).
   There were some patients which had shown signs of deterioration in the cohort. The frequency of routine observation monitoring was increased in 2 cases, 3 patients were referred to a senior clinician and 2 patients were initiated on the sepsis pathway.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the evaluation of digital alerts to nurses in real time. Although not all alerts were acknowledged, deterioration on the ward observations was detected and actions were taken accordingly. Patients were started on the sepsis pathway and escalation to senior clinicians occurred. Further research is required to review why only some alerts were acknowledged and the effects of digital alerting on patient outcomes.

KW  - wearable cardioverter defibrillator
AB  - Background: Wearable cardioverter defibrillators (WCD) are used as a 'bridging' technology in patients, who are temporarily at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). Several factors should be taken into consideration, for example patient selection, compliance and optimal drug treatment, when WCD is prescribed. We aimed to present real-world data from seven centres from Germany and Switzerland according to age differences regarding the outcome, prognosis, WCD data and compliance.Materials and Methods: Between 04/2012 and 03/2021, 1105 patients were included in this registry. Outcome data according to age differences (old & GE;45 years compared to young < 45 years) were analysed. At young age, WCDs were more often prescribed due to congenital heart disease and myocarditis. On the other hand, ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) was more present in older patients. Wear days of WCD were similar between both groups (p = .115). In addition, during the WCD use, documented arrhythmic life-threatening events were comparable [sustained ventricular tachycardia: 5.8% vs. 7.7%, ventricular fibrillation (VF) .5% vs. .6%] and consequently the rate of appropriate shocks was similar between both groups. Left ventricular ejection fraction improvement was documented over follow-up with a better improvement in younger patients as compared to older patients (77% vs. 63%, p = .002). In addition, at baseline, the rate of atrial fibrillation was significantly higher in the older age group (23% vs. 8%; p = .001). The rate of permanent cardiac implantable electronic device implantation (CiED) was lower in the younger group (25% vs. 36%, p = .05). The compliance rate defined as wearing WCD at least 20 h per day was significantly lower in young patients compared to old patients (68.9% vs. 80.9%, p < .001). During the follow-up, no significant difference regarding all-cause mortality or arrhythmic death was documented in both groups. A low compliance rate of wearing WCD is predicted by young patients and patients suffering from non-ischaemic cardiomyopathies.Conclusion: Although the compliance rate in different age groups is high, the average wear hours tended to be lower in young patients compared to older patients. The clinical events were similar in younger patients compared to older patients.

AB  - Background: Spasticity is a motor disorder that is commonly treated manually by a physical therapist (PhT) stretching the muscles. Recent data on learning have demonstrated the importance of human-to-human interaction in improving rehabilitation: cooperative motor behavior engages specific areas of the motor system compared with execution of a task alone.
   Objectives: We hypothesize that PhT-guided therapy that involves active collaboration with the patient (Pt) through shared biomechanical visual biofeedback (vBFB) positively impacts learning and performance by the Pt during ankle spasticity treatment. A sensorized ankle foot orthosis (AFO) was developed to provide online quantitative data of joint range of motion (ROM), angular velocity, and electromyographic activity to the PhT and Pt during the treatment of ankle spasticity.
   Methods: Randomized controlled clinical trial. Ten subacute stroke inpatients, randomized into experimental (EXP) and control (CTRL) groups, underwent sixweeks of daily treatment. The EXP group was treated with an active AFO, and the CTRL group was given an inactive AFO. Spasticity, ankle ROM, ankle active and passive joint speed, and coactivation index (CI) were assessed at enrollment and after 15-30 sessions.
   Results: Spasticity and CI (p<0.005) decreased significantly after training only in the EXP group, in association with a significant rise in active joint speed and active ROM (p<0.05). Improvements in spasticity (p<0.05), active joint speed (p<0.001), and CI (p<0.001) after treatment differed between the EXP and CTRL groups.
   Conclusions: PhT-Pt sharing of exercise information, provided by joint sensorization and vBFB, improved the efficacy of the conventional approach for treating ankle spasticity in subacute stroke Pts.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in the medical field has experienced a long history of development. In turn, some long-standing points and challenges in the medical field have also prompted diverse research teams to continue to explore AI in depth. With the development of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data, and 5G mobile networks, AI technology has been more widely adopted in the medical field. In addition, the in-depth integration of AI and IoT technology enables the gradual improvement of medical diagnosis and treatment capabilities so as to provide services to the public in a more effective way. In this work, we examine the technical basis of IoT, cloud computing, big data analysis and machine learning involved in clinical medicine, combined with concepts of specific algorithms such as activity recognition, behavior recognition, anomaly detection, assistant decision-making system, to describe the scenario-based applications of remote diagnosis and treatment collaboration, neonatal intensive care unit, cardiology intensive care unit, emergency first aid, venous thromboembolism, monitoring nursing, image-assisted diagnosis, etc. We also systematically summarize the application of AI and IoT in clinical medicine, analyze the main challenges thereof, and comment on the trends and future developments in this field.

AB  - Smart healthcare has changed the way how the patient interacts with the specialists for treatment. How-ever, security and support for various diseases are still the concern for such smart automated systems. One of the critical diseases namely Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), is a major concern for the person with pro-longed diabetes and may lead to complete blindness irrespective of age groups. Moreover, in recent years blockchain has gained popularity in providing secure communication between sender and receiver. Hence, this work focus on designing a blockchain-based smart healthcare system for the early detection of diabetic retinopathy. However, early detection of DR impose complexities and requires expert diagnosis, which is not available everywhere. Hence, the proposed smart healthcare model contains a Computer-Aided Diag-nosis (CAD) assistance for early detection of symptoms of the disease. The CAD model may assist the ophthalmologists in the early detection of DR, which requires intensive research in developing an efficient and accurate model that can operate without human interaction. This study provides an empirical analysis of these factors to design the best model for early detection of DR. The best model can be used to develop IoT based smart devices to detect DR in diabetic patients. The study also explains the importance of IoT and blockchain-based technology for the development of smart healthcare systems. The values of the pa-rameters and type of hyperparameters choosen from the study is used in a proposed 2-branch CNN model, and the model is validated using the Kaggle fundus image set. Analysis of various parameters and using their best values gives an outstanding performance in the proposed 2-branch CNN model.

AB  - The current global pandemic, Covid-19, is a severe threat to human health and existence especially when it is mutating very frequently. Being a novel disease, Covid-19 is impacting the patients with comorbidities and is predicted to have long-term consequences, even for those who have recovered from it. To clearly recognize its impact, it is important to comprehend the complex relationship between Covid-19 and other diseases. It is also being observed that people with good immune system are less susceptible to the disease. It is perceived that if a correlation between Covid-19, other diseases, and diet is realized, then caregivers would be able to enhance their further course of medical action and recommendations. Network Analysis is one such technique that can bring forth such complex interdependencies and associations. In this paper, a Network Analysis-based approach has been proposed for analyzing the interplay of diets/foods along with Covid-19 and other diseases. Relationships between Covid-19, diabetes mellitus type 2 (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and diets have been curated, visualized, and further analyzed in this study so as to predict unknown associations. Network algorithms including Louvain graph algorithm (LA), K nearest neighbors (KNN), and Page rank algorithms (PR) have been employed for predicting a total of 60 disease-diet associations, out of which 46 have been found to be either significant in disease risk prevention/mitigation or in its progression as validated using PubMed literature. A precision of 76.7% has been achieved which is significant considering the involvement of a novel disease like Covid-19. The generated interdependencies can be further explored by medical professionals and caregivers in order to plan healthy eating patterns for Covid-19 patients. The proposed approach can also be utilized for finding beneficial diets for different combinations of comorbidities with Covid-19 as per the underlying health conditions of a patient.

AB  - Background: Sleep is essential for one's health and quality of life. Wearable technologies that use motion and temperature sensors have made it possible to self-monitor sleep. Although there is a growing body of research on sleep monitoring using wearable devices for healthy young-to-middle-aged adults, few studies have focused on older adults, including those living with dementia.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate the impact of age and dementia on sleep detection through movement and wrist temperature.
   Methods: A total of 10 younger adults, 10 healthy older adults, and 8 older adults living with dementia (OAWD) were recruited. Each participant wore a Mi Band 2 (accemetry-based sleep detection) and our custom-built wristband (actigraphy and wrist temperature) 24 hours a day for 2 weeks and was asked to keep a daily sleep journal. Sleep parameters detected by the Mi Band 2 were compared with sleep journals, and visual analysis of actigraphy and temperature data was performed.
   Results: The absolute differences in sleep onset and offset between the sleep journals and Mi Band 2 were 39 (SD 51) minutes and 31 (SD 52) minutes for younger adults, 49 (SD 58) minutes and 33 (SD 58) minutes for older adults, and 253 (SD 104) minutes and 161 (SD 94) minutes for OAWD. The Mi Band 2 was unable to accurately detect sleep in 3 healthy older adults and all OAWDs. The average sleep and wake temperature difference of OAWD (1.26 degrees C, SD 0.82 degrees C) was significantly lower than that of healthy older adults (2.04 degrees C, SD 0.70 degrees C) and healthy younger adults (2.48 degrees C, SD 0.88 degrees C). Actigraphy data showed that older adults had more movement during sleep compared with younger adults and that this trend appears to increase for those with dementia. Conclusions: The Mi Band 2 did not accurately detect sleep in older adults who had greater levels of nighttime movement. As more nighttime movement appears to be a phenomenon that increases in prevalence with age and even more so with dementia, further research needs to be conducted with a larger sample size and greater diversity of commercially available wearable devices to explore these trends more conclusively. All participants, including older adults and OAWD, had a distinct sleep and wake wrist temperature contrast, which suggests that wrist temperature could be leveraged to create more robust and broadly applicable sleep detection algorithms.

AB  - Introduction Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a beneficial tool for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases with, however, low participation rates. Telerehabilitation, intergrading mobile technologies and wireless sensors may advance the cardiac patients' adherence. This study will investigate the efficacy, efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness of a telerehabilitation programme based on objective exercise telemonitoring and evaluation of cardiorespiratory fitness.
   Methods and analysis A supervised, parallel-group, single-blind randomised controlled trial will be conducted. A total of 124 patients with coronary disease will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into two groups: intervention telerehabilitation group (TELE-CR) (n=62) and control centre-based cardiac rehabilitation group (CB-CR) (n=62). Participants will receive a 12-week exercise-based rehabilitation programme, remotely monitored for the TELE-CR group and standard supervised for the CB-CR group. All participants will perform aerobic training at 70% of their maximal heart rate, as obtained from cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) for 20min plus 20 min for strengthening and balance training, three times per week. The primary outcomes will be the assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness, expressed as peak oxygen uptake assessed by the CPET test and the 6 min walk test. Secondary outcomes will be the physical activity, the safety of the exercise intervention (number of adverse events that may occur during the exercise), the quality of life, the training adherence, the anxiety and depression levels, the nicotine dependence and cost-effectiveness. Assessments will be held at baseline, end of intervention (12 weeks) and follow-up (36 weeks).
   Ethics and dissemination The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Thessaly (1108/1 -12-2021) and by the Ethics Committee of the General University Hospital of Larissa (3780/31-01-2022). The results of this study will be disseminated through manuscript publications and conference presentations.

AB  - Most caregivers of people with dementia (CPWD) experience a high degree of stress due to the demands of providing care, especially when addressing unpredictable behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Such challenging responsibilities make caregivers susceptible to poor sleep quality with detrimental effects on their overall health. Hence, monitoring caregivers' sleep quality can provide important CPWD stress assessment. Most current sleep studies are based on polysomnography, which is expensive and potentially disrupts the caregiving routine. To address these issues, we propose a clinical decision support system to predict sleep quality based on trends of physiological signals in the deep sleep stage. This system utilizes four raw physiological signals using a wearable device (E4 wristband): heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, body movement, and skin temperature. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, analyses were conducted on a two-week period of sleep monitored on eight CPWD. The best performance is achieved using the random forest classifier with an accuracy of 75% for sleep quality, and 73% for restfulness, respectively. We found that the most important features to detect these measures are sleep efficiency (ratio of amount of time asleep to the amount of time in bed) and skin temperature. The results from our sleep analysis system demonstrate the capability of using wearable sensors to measure sleep quality and restfulness in CPWD.

AB  - According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Parkinson's disease (PD) affects one million Americans, with 50,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Symptoms associated with PD, such as asymmetric gait and shortened step length, can lead to episodes of freezing of gait (FOG) and increased susceptibility to falls. There is a need for rehabilitation techniques, particularly those that can be readily utilized on a daily basis, to prevent or slow the progression of these symptoms. Step Plus is an innovative wearable rehabilitation device designed to provide auditory and haptic feedback through a smartphone application. The current version of the device measures and tracks stride length in real time using an inertial measurement unit that includes a three-dimensional accelerometer and gyroscope. Work is in progress to provide real-time feedback to encourage users to alter their gait patterns. The design of the system will allow delivery of progress reports to the user's neurologist and/or physical therapists. Experiments with the body-worn device on seven adult subjects without PD demonstrated the ability to measure stride length with an average error of less than 10% across a range of four self-selected gait speeds on all subjects. By monitoring an individual's stride length over time, StepPlus can gather longitudinal data that could be used to support clinical decisions. Future work will implement the real-time feedback feature and investigate the ability of Step Plus to decrease the frequency of FOG episodes for the PD population.

AB  - Early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of respiratory failure (RF) in the course of the most prevalent chronic cardio-vascular (CVD) and respiratory diseases (CRD) are a clinical, unresolved problem because wearable, non-invasive, and user-friendly medical devices, which could grant reliable measures of the oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) and heart rate (HR) in real-life during daily activities are still lacking. In this study, we investigated the agreement between a new medical wrist-worn device (BrOxy M) and a reference, medical pulseoximeter (Nellcor PM 1000N). Twelve healthy volunteers (aged 20-51 years, 84% males, 33% with black skin, obtaining, during the controlled hypoxia test, the simultaneous registration of 219 data pairs, homogeneously deployed in the levels of Sat.O-2 97%, 92%, 87%, 82% [ISO 80601-2-61:2017 standard (paragraph EE.3)]) were included. The paired T test 0 and the Bland-Altman plot were performed to assess bias and accuracy. SpO(2) and HR readings by the two devices resulted significantly correlated (r = 0.91 and 0.96, p < 0.001, respectively). Analyses excluded the presence of proportional bias. For SpO(2), the mean bias was -0.18% and the accuracy (A(RMS)) was 2.7%. For HR the mean bias was 0.25 bpm and the A(RMS)3.7 bpm. The sensitivity to detect SpO(2) <= 94% was 94.4%. The agreement between BrOxy M and the reference pulse oximeter was "substantial" (for SpO(2) cut-off 94% and 90%, k = 0.79 and k = 0.80, respectively). We conclude that BrOxy M demonstrated accuracy, reliability and consistency in measuring SpO(2) and HR, being fully comparable with a reference medical pulseoxymeter, with no adverse effects. As a wearable device, Broxy M can measure continually SpO(2) and HR in everyday life, helping in detecting and following up CVD and CRD subjects.

AB  - Objective:In contrast with exercise, or structured physical activity (PA), glycemic disturbances due to daily unstructured PA in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is largely underresearched, with limited information on treatment recommendations. We present results from retrospective analysis of data collected under patients' free-living conditions that illuminate the association between PA, as measured by an off-the-shelf activity tracker, and postprandial blood glucose control. Research Design and Methods:Data from 37 patients with T1D during two clinical studies with identical data collection protocols were analyzed retrospectively: 4 weeks of continuous glucose monitoring, carbohydrate intake, insulin injections, and PA (assessed through wearable activity tracker) were collected in free-living conditions. Five-hour glucose area under curves (GAUCs) following the last-bolused meal of every day were computed to assess postprandial glucose excursions, and their relation with corresponding antecedent PA was analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression models, accounting for meal, insulin, and current glycemic state. Results:Datasets yielded 845 days of data from 37 subjects (22.8 +/- 11.6 days/subject); postmeal GAUC was negatively associated with total daily PA measured by step count (P = 0.025), and total time spent performing higher than light-intensity PA (P = 0.042). Patients with higher median total daily PA exhibited lower average postprandial GAUC (P < 0.01). Additional analyses indicated that daily PA likely presents an immediate and delayed impact on glucose control. Conclusion:Daily PA assessed by commonly available sensors is significantly associated with glycemic exposure after an evening meal, indicating that quantitative assessment of PA may be useful in mealtime treatment decisions.

AB  - The use of electrical bioimpedance methods in medical and personalized healthcare applications requires sophisticated hardware and measurement settings. Here, we describe ZiNk, a standalone bioimpedance analyzer with Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring features. ZiNk can be connected to a secure wireless or local area network and accessed using any device with a Web browser and Internet access. Through a user-friendly Web-based access able to handle multiple simultaneous connections, the user(s) can perform single or multiple bioimpedance measurement(s) remotely. ZiNk supports the measurement of bioimpedance in both time and frequency domains using stepped-sine and multisine excitation signals. Embedded signal processing calculates bioimpedance from voltage and current signals using a coherent demodulation and the fast Fourier transform. ZiNk can also measure bioimpedance synchronized with either electrocardiogram (ECG) or electromyogram signals. The data is displayed on the user's Web client from where it can be downloaded for further analysis. ZiNk full bandwidth is 100 mHz to 10 MHz and the average signal-to-noise ratio tested from 1 kHz to 1 MHz is 56 dB. The extended calibration method proposed here reduces the average magnitude error with respect to the existing three-parameter calibration approach by 0.6 Omega (0.3%) measuring phantoms. Thoracic bioimpedance and ECG measurements on volunteers demonstrate the feasibility of detecting respiration changes while showing the results in real time on the user device's Web browser. The performance, portability, and integration of ZiNk makes it a suitable standalone platform for medical and personalized health IoT monitoring applications.

AB  - Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems.

AB  - Novel wearable devices for heart rhythm analysis using either photoplethysmography (PPG) or electrocardiogram (ECG) are in daily clinical practice. This survey aimed to assess impact of these technologies on physicians' clinical decision-making and to define, how data from these devices should be presented and integrated into clinical practice. The online survey included 22 questions, focusing on the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) based on wearable rhythm device recordings, suitable indications for wearable rhythm devices, data presentation and processing, reimbursement, and future perspectives. A total of 539 respondents {median age 38 [interquartile range (IQR) 34-46] years, 29% female} from 51 countries world-wide completed the survey. Whilst most respondents would diagnose AF (83%), fewer would initiate oral anticoagulation therapy based on a single-lead ECG tracing. Significantly fewer still (27%) would make the diagnosis based on PPG-based tracing. Wearable ECG technology is acceptable for the majority of respondents for screening, diagnostics, monitoring, and follow-up of arrhythmia patients, while respondents were more reluctant to use PPG technology for these indications. Most respondents (74%) would advocate systematic screening for AF using wearable rhythm devices, starting at patients' median age of 60 (IQR 50-65) years. Thirty-six percent of respondents stated that there is no reimbursement for diagnostics involving wearable rhythm devices in their countries. Most respondents (56.4%) believe that costs of wearable rhythm devices should be shared between patients and insurances. Wearable single- or multiple-lead ECG technology is accepted for multiple indications in current clinical practice and triggers AF diagnosis and treatment. The unmet needs that call for action are reimbursement plans and integration of wearable rhythm device data into patient's files and hospital information systems.

KW  - ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION
AB  - IntroductionThe Apple watch (AW) irregular rhythm notification (IRN) feature uses photoplethysmography to identify prolonged episodes of irregular rhythm suggestive of atrial fibrillation (AF). IRN is FDA cleared for those with no previous history of AF, however, these devices are increasingly being used for AF management. The objective of the present study was to determine the accuracy of the IRN in subjects with a previous diagnosis of nonpermanent AF. MethodsSubjects with a history of nonpermanent AF and either an insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) or cardiac implanted electronic device (CIED) with <5% ventricular pacing were fitted with an AW Series 5 for 6 months. AF episodes were compared between the ICM/CIED and IRN. The primary endpoints were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the IRN by subject for AF >= 1 h. Secondary endpoints were sensitivity and PPV by AF episode >= 1 h. Analysis was limited to a maximum of 10 ICM/CIED episodes per subject and included only those AF episodes occurring during active AW use confirmed by activity data. ResultsThirty participants were enrolled. Mean age was 65.4 +/- 12.2 years and 40% were female. There were 10 ICMs and 20 CIEDs. Eleven subjects had AF on ICM/CIED while the AW was worn, of whom 8 were detected by IRN. There were no false positive IRN detections by subject ("by subject" 72% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% PPV, and 90% NPV). Five subjects had AF only when the AW was not worn. There were a total of 70 AF episodes on ICM/CIED, 35 of which occurred while the AW was being worn. Of these, 21 were detected by IRN with 1 false positive ("by episode" sensitivity = 60.0%, PPV = 95.5%). ConclusionIn a population with known AF, the AW IRN had a low rate of false positive detections and high specificity. Sensitivity for detection by subject and by AF episode was lower. The current IRN algorithm appears accurate for AF screening as currently cleared, but increased sensitivity and wear times would be necessary for disease management.

AB  - Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) is a wearable human assistant cyborg-type robot that helps lower-leg movement based on bioelectrical signals detected from the voluntary movement of the person wearing it. In this study, we developed a novel staged HAL treatment protocol for patients with acute stroke. The Regain Program for Gait with HAL (RPG-HAL) was formulated in four steps, based on the severity of limb paralysis. Twenty-one patients with acute stroke received a combination treatment of RPG-HAL and conventional rehabilitation. The feasibility and safety of RPG-HAL were evaluated based on changes in physical function and activities of daily living (ADL). RPG-HAL yielded improvement in gait speed, cadence, step length, and functional ambulation category (FAC). The effect size was >0.8 in all measurements. FAC (1.90) and Barthel Index (BI) (1.92) exhibited the highest scores. Twelve out of 14 patients with FAC 0 before RPG-HAL reached the upper FAC. Thus, earlier intervention using RPG-HAL as improving physical function, ADL, and gait ability in patients with stroke.

AB  - Stress is one of the major causes of diseases in modern society. Therefore, measuring and managing the degree of stress is crucial to maintain a healthy life. The goal of this paper is to improve stress-detection performance using precise signal processing based on photoplethysmogram (PPG) data. PPG signals can be collected through wearable devices, but are affected by many internal and external noises. To solve this problem, we propose a two-step denoising method, to filter the noise in terms of frequency and remove the remaining noise in terms of time. We also propose an ensemble-based multiple peak-detecting method to extract accurate features through refined signals. We used a typical public dataset, namely, wearable stress and affect detection dataset (WESAD) and measured the performance of the proposed PPG denoising and peak-detecting methods by lightweight multiple classifiers. By measuring the stress-detection performance using the proposed method, we demonstrate an improved result compared with the existing methods: accuracy is 96.50 and the F1 score is 93.36%.

AB  - Remote healthcare and telemedicine technology have witnessed a large and rapid development in the last decade with the large development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, where various types of medical sensors are aggregated for measuring medical parameters and transmitting them anywhere. Smart portable products can now be used to monitor different medical aspects to track human health. Also, they can be used in the prediagnosis of various diseases and in detecting abnormalities of organ functionality. In this article, we design and implement a multifunction and portable health monitoring system, which can help in daily medical inspections. The developed system monitors various medical aspects: heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation level (SpO(2)), body temperature, photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, electrocardiography (ECG) signal, room temperature, and room humidity. The obtained measurements are displayed on the built-in display or transmitted over Wi-Fi to either a mobile application, in the local mode, or to the cloud storage for remote monitoring. The developed system can be used to keep an eye on the people we need to care about, while keeping them in their normal daily life. The maximum error percentage of the proposed system is reported as 2.67%, 2.04%, and 1.58% for HR, SpO(2), and body temperature, respectively, compared to commercial devices. In addition, statistical tests were performed and they showed a high level of agreement between the observed and the reference measurements. The results indicate the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system to be used in daily medical applications.

AB  - To monitor health and diagnose disease in the early stage, future healthcare standards will likely include the continuous monitoring of various vital data. One approach to collect such information is a wearable and flexible device, which detects information from the skin surface. An important dataset is heart pulse information. Herein a method to monitor the detailed pulse signal from a wrist stably and reliably is proposed. Specifically, a soft pneumatic balloon operated by a soft pump applies the appropriate pressure over a tactile sensor onto the radial artery of the wrist to detect detailed heart pulse waves. The soft pump, pneumatic balloon, and flexible tactile pressure sensor are characterized as a fundamental study. Additionally, a proof-of-concept of this integrated device platform is demonstrated by monitoring the heart pulse from a wrist with and without the soft pump functions.

AB  - Wearable technologies such as bionic limbs, robotic exoskeletons and neuromodulation devices have long been designed with the goal of enhancing human movement. However, current technologies have shown only modest results in healthy individuals and limited clinical impact. A central element hampering progress is that wearable technologies do not interact directly with tissues in the composite neuromuscular system. That is, current wearable systems do not take into account how biological targets (e.g. joints, tendons, muscles, nerves) react to mechanical or electrical stimuli, especially at extreme ends of the spatiotemporal scale (e.g. cell growth over months or years). Here, we outline a framework for 'closing-the-loop' between wearable technology and human biology. We envision a new class of wearable systems that will be classified as 'steering devices' rather than cassistive devices' and outline the suggested research roadmap for the next 10-15 years. Wearable systems that steer, rather than assist, should be capable of delivering coordinated electro-mechanical stimuli to alter, in a controlled way, neuromuscular tissue form and function over time scales ranging from seconds (e.g. a movement cycle) to months (e.g. recovery stage following neuromuscular injuries) and beyond (e.g. across ageing stages). With an emphasis on spinal cord electrical stimulation and exosuits for the lower extremity, we explore developments in three key directions: (a) recording neuromuscular cellular activity from the intact moving human in vivo, (b) predicting tissue function and adaptation in response to electro-mechanical stimuli over time and (c) controlling tissue form and function with enough certainty to induce targeted, positive changes in the future. We discuss how this framework could restore, maintain or augment human movement and set the course for a new era in the development of bioprotective wearable devices. That is, devices designed to directly respond to biological cues to maintain integrity of underlying physiological systems over the lifespan.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a huge, exciting new phenomenon that is changing the world of technology and innovating various industries, including healthcare. It has specific applications and changes in the medical world based on what can be done for clinical workflow models. The first and most fundamental thing that IoMT does in healthcare is to bring a flood of new data into medical processes. In this study, an efficient Internet of Medical Things based cancer detection model was proposed. In fact, for many, new fitness monitors and watches are one of the best examples on the Internet; these mobile, portable, wearable devices can record real-time heart rate, blood pressure, and eye movement of cancer patients. These details are sent to doctors or anywhere else. The proposed method leads to a kind of big data renaissance in the health service. The proposed model gets more accuracy while comparing with the existing models. This will help the doctors to analyze the patients' health report and provides better treatment.

AB  - Background: Surgical cancer patients often have deteriorated physical activity (PA), which in turn, contributes to poor outcomes and early recurrence of cancer. Mobile health (mHealth) platforms are progressively used for monitoring clinical conditions in medical subjects. Despite prevalent enthusiasm for the use of mHealth, limited studies have applied these platforms to surgical patients who are in much need of care because of acutely significant loss of physical function during the postoperative period.
   Objective: The aim of our study was to determine the feasibility and clinical value of using 1 wearable device connected with the mHealth platform to record PA among patients with gastric cancer (GC) who had undergone gastrectomy.
   Methods: We enrolled surgical GC patients during their inpatient stay and trained them to use the app and wearable device, enabling them to automatically monitor their walking steps. The patients continued to transmit data until postoperative day 28. The primary aim of this study was to validate the feasibility of this system, which was defined as the proportion of participants using each element of the system (wearing the device and uploading step counts) for at least 70% of the 28-day study. "Definitely feasible," "possibly feasible," and "not feasible" were defined as >= 70%, 50%-69%, and <50% of participants meeting the criteria, respectively. Moreover, the secondary aim was to evaluate the clinical value of measuring walking steps by examining whether they were associated with early discharge (length of hospital stay < 9 days).
   Results: We enrolled 43 GC inpatients for the analysis. The weekly submission rate at the first, second, third, and fourth week was 100%, 93%, 91%, and 86%, respectively. The overall daily submission rate was 95.5% (1150 days, with 43 subjects submitting data for 28 days). These data showed that this system met the definition of " definitely feasible." Of the 54 missed transmission days, 6 occurred in week 2, 12 occurred in week 3, and 36 occurred in week 4. The primary reason for not sending data was that patients or caregivers forgot to charge the wearable devices (>90%). Furthermore, we used a multivariable-adjusted model to predict early discharge, which demonstrated that every 1000-step increment of walking on postoperative day 5 was associated with early discharge (odds ratio 2.72, 95% CI 1.17-6.32; P=.02).
   Conclusions: Incorporating the use of mobile phone apps with wearable devices to record PA in patients of postoperative GC was feasible in patients undergoing gastrectomy in this study. With the support of the mHealth platform, this app offers seamless tracing of patients' recovery with a little extra burden and turns subjective PA into an objective, measurable parameter.

AB  - Elderly people requiring care the entire day usually depend on the availability of their family members to give assistance. However, the family members might not provide appropriate help especially in an emergent situation. The application of Internet of Things (IoT) technology with a variety of interconnected devices provides the solution. We propose an IoT-based smart healthcare system comprising wearable devices, which integrates a variety of contact sensors with location-based mesh networks (LBMN) such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections to continuously sense various parameters of aging people. The BLE-connected devices such as wearable sensors, fixed sensors, seat cushions, pedal mats, magnetic reed switches, and mobile devices are all involved in collecting, processing, and transmitting physiological data and their locations to the cloud. Through the utilization of convenient interfaces such as software applications on smartphones and web pages on computers, it provides real time monitoring of the elderly in terms of localization, activity pattern, and health status. Thus the system enables early detection of health risks to the elderly. We used Platform as a service (PaaS) to receive and store the health data generated from the interconnected devices and to perform analysis. The essential feature of this LBMN is to generate a complete 6W(Who, What,When,Where,Why and How)big data for policy, feed it to the PaaS analysis to easily and quickly obtain more accurate data, and then develop possible health strategy or preventive measures. The proposed healthcare system detected that, out of the 20 participants recruited, 2 persons (10%) were often restless. It was also able to detect abnormal daily activity patterns with more tag positioning and the historical data from the devices. More importantly, it can help to prevent potential physical and neuropsychiatric disorders based on the real-time monitoring information and analyzed historical data for the aging people.

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a widespread disease and the leading cause of death worldwide. Home care is essential for patients with CVD, and it involves the daily monitoring of important CVD-related vital signs using methods including electrocardiography (ECG), heart rate monitoring, pulse oximetry (SpO2), and continuous blood pressure measurement. However, a wearable device that can monitor these parameters simultaneously remains unavailable; herein, we propose a lightweight, highly integrated sensor that can do so. In this sensor, an analog front end (AFE) integrated chip (IC) is implemented in the sensor to detect one-lead ECG and two-wavelength photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. The highly integrated IC minimizes both the size and power requirement of the sensor. Moreover, its comprehensive functions include adjustable gain, current compensation, lead off, and fast recovery-all of which are crucial for wearable applications in large populations. Accordingly, the sensor can apply the adaptive adjust method to automatically adjust the IC parameters to suit a range of applications and users. In addition, the heart rate is calculated from the R-R interval from the ECG signals, whereas the SpO2 is calibrated with a univariate quadratic equation with less than 1% mean error. Our sensor can also calculate the systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by using a support vector machine based calibration-less model with the features of infrared PPG and ECG signals. The model is trained on our pre-collected wearable dataset and has a mean error +/- standard deviation of -2.10 +/- 7.07 mmHg for SBP and 0.04 +/- 7.34 mmHg for DBP in 16 volunteers. In conclusion, this paper reports on a multimodal, vital sign monitoring sensor-with small size, low power, and dynamic compatibility-suitable for patients with CVD under home care.

AB  - Assessment of the cough severity is essential when dealing with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and COVID-19. Although a few wearable devices have been reported for cough detection, they mostly rely on microphones, accelerometers, or throat-fixed flexible sensors, which suffer from key issues including privacy disclosure and speech/motion artifacts. This study presents a chest-laminated electronic skin (e-skin) for reliable cough detection. Mixed dumbbell-like networks and through-holes are engineered on hard-to-stretch composite films for high stretching force sensitivity and sweat permeation, respectively. The e-skin can effectively reduce speech-signal and motion artifacts owing to firm adhesion and conformal contact with the chest even on sweaty skin. Experimental results show that the specificity for cough identification is as high as 99.75% through machine learning of automated acoustic analysis, even in the presence of hard-to-distinguish daily activities such as throat clearing. The developed chest-laminated e-skin is a simple, comfortable, yet reliable method to detect cough for the primary diagnosis of respiratory diseases by extracting subtle acoustic information from cough.

This paper is focused on the use of a decision analysis tool for the early detection of preeclampsia in women at risk. This tool applies a fuzzy linguistic approach implemented in a wearable device. In order to develop this tool, a real dataset containing data of pregnant women with high risk of preeclampsia from a health center has been analyzed, and a fuzzy linguistic methodology with two main phases is used. Firstly, linguistic transformation is applied to the dataset to increase the interpretability and flexibility in the analysis of preeclampsia. Secondly, knowledge extraction is done by means of inferring rules using decision trees to classify the dataset. The obtained linguistic rules provide understandable monitoring of preeclampsia based on wearable applications and devices. Furthermore, this paper not only introduces the proposed methodology, but also presents a wearable application prototype which applies the rules inferred from the fuzzy decision tree to detect preeclampsia in women at risk. The proposed methodology and the developed wearable application can be easily adapted to other contexts such as diabetes or hypertension.

AB  - BackgroundSmart insole technologies that provide biofeedback on foot health can support foot-care in adults with diabetes. However, the factors that influence patient uptake and acceptance of this technology are unclear. Therefore, the aim of this mixed-methods study was to use an established theoretical framework to determine a model of psychosocial factors that best predicts participant intention to use smart insoles.MethodsFifty-three adults with diabetes from regional Australia completed the validated Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine the psychosocial factors that best predict behavioural intention to adopt a smart insole. Additionally, a focus group was conducted and thematic analysis was performed to explore barriers and enablers to adopting this technology.ResultsThe multiple regression model that best predicted intention to adopt the smart insole (adjusted R-2=0.51, p<0.001) identified that self-efficacy (=0.67, p=0.001) and attitude (=0.72, p<0.001) were significant predictors of behavioural intention, while effort expectancy (=-0.52, p=0.003) and performance expectancy (=-0.40, p=0.040) were moderating factors. Thematic analysis illustrates the importance of attitude and self-efficacy on participants' behavioural intentions, influenced by participant's belief in the device's clinical efficacy and anticipated effort expectancy.ConclusionsThis mixed-methods study demonstrates that attitude, self-efficacy, performance expectancy and effort expectancy combine to predict intention to adopt smart insole technology. Clinicians should consider these psychosocial factors when they prescribe and implement smart soles with patients at high risk of foot ulceration.

AB  - Stroke is the second leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of disability in the world. According to the World Health Organization, 11 million people suffer a stroke yearly. The cost of the disease is exorbitant, and the most widely used treatment is conventional physiotherapy. Therefore, assistive technology emerges to optimize rehabilitation and functional capabilities, but cost, robustness, usability, and long-term results still restrict the technology selection. This work aimed to develop a low-cost ankle orthosis, the G-Exos, a wearable exoskeleton to increase motor capability by assisting dorsiflexion, plantarflexion, and ankle stability. A hybrid system provided near-natural gait movements using active, motor, and passive assistance, elastic band. The system was validated with 10 volunteers with foot drop: seven with stroke, two with incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI), and one with acute inflammatory transverse myelitis (ATM). The G-Exos showed assistive functionality for gait movement. A Friedman test showed a significant difference in dorsiflexion amplitude with the use of the G-Exos compared to gait without the use of the G-Exos [x((3))(2) = 98.56, p < 0.001]. In addition, there was also a significant difference in ankle eversion and inversion comparing walking with and without the G-Exos [x((3))(2) = 36.12, p < 0.001]. The G-Exos is a robust, lightweight, and flexible assistive technology device to detect the gait phase accurately and provide better human-machine interaction. G-Exos training improved capability to deal with gait disorders, usability, and motor and functional recovery. Wearable assistive technologies lead to a better quality of life and contribute using in activities of daily living.

AB  - Heart sound classification plays a vital role in the early detection of cardiovascular disorders, especially for small primary health care clinics. Despite that much progress has been made for heart sound classification in recent years, most of them are based on conventional segmented features and shallow structure based classifiers. These conventional acoustic representation and classification methods may be insufficient in characterizing heart sound, and generally suffer from a degraded performance due to the complicated and changeable cardiac acoustic environment. In this paper, we propose a new heart sound classification method based on improved Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) features and convolutional recurrent neural networks. The Mel-frequency cepstrums are firstly calculated without dividing the heart sound signal. A new improved feature extraction scheme based on MFCC is proposed to elaborate the dynamic characteristics among consecutive heart sound signals. Finally, the MFCC-based features are fed to a deep convolutional and recurrent neural network (CRNN) for feature learning and later classification task. The proposed deep learning framework can take advantage of the encoded local characteristics extracted from the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the long-term dependencies captured by the recurrent neural network (RNN). Comprehensive studies on the performance of different network parameters and different network connection strategies are presented in this paper. Performance comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are given for discussions. Experiments show that, for the two-class classification problem (pathological or non-pathological), a classification accuracy of 98% has been achieved on the 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge database.

AB  - Most computer systems authenticate users only once at the time of initial login, which can lead to security concerns. Continuous authentication has been explored as an approach for alleviating such concerns. Previous methods for continuous authentication primarily use biometrics, e.g., fingerprint and face recognition, or behaviometrics, e.g., key stroke patterns. We describe CABA, a novel continuous authentication system that is inspired by and leverages the emergence of sensors for pervasive and continuous health monitoring. CABA authenticates users based on their BioAura, an ensemble of biomedical signal streams that can be collected continuously and non-invasively using wearable medical devices. While each such signal may not be highly discriminative by itself, we demonstrate that a collection of such signals, along with robust machine learning, can provide high accuracy levels. We demonstrate the feasibility of CABA through analysis of traces from the MIMIC-II dataset. We propose various applications of CABA, and describe how it can be extended to user identification and adaptive access control authorization. Finally, we discuss possible attacks on the proposed scheme and suggest corresponding countermeasures.

AB  - OBJECTIVEAutomated insulin delivery is the new standard for type 1 diabetes, but exercise-related hypoglycemia remains a challenge. Our aim was to determine whether a dual-hormone closed-loop system using wearable sensors to detect exercise and adjust dosing to reduce exercise-related hypoglycemia would outperform other forms of closed-loop and open-loop therapy.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSParticipants underwent four arms in randomized order: dual-hormone, single-hormone, predictive low glucose suspend, and continuation of current care over 4 outpatient days. Each arm included three moderate-intensity aerobic exercise sessions. The two primary outcomes were percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and in a target range (70-180 mg/dL) assessed across the entire study and from the start of the in-clinic exercise until the next meal.RESULTSThe analysis included 20 adults with type 1 diabetes who completed all arms. The mean time (SD) in hypoglycemia was the lowest with dual-hormone during the exercise period: 3.4% (4.5) vs. 8.3% (12.6) single-hormone (P = 0.009) vs. 7.6% (8.0) predictive low glucose suspend (P < 0.001) vs. 4.3% (6.8) current care where pre-exercise insulin adjustments were allowed (P = 0.49). Time in hypoglycemia was also the lowest with dual-hormone during the entire 4-day study: 1.3% (1.0) vs. 2.8% (1.7) single-hormone (P < 0.001) vs. 2.0% (1.5) predictive low glucose suspend (P = 0.04) vs. 3.1% (3.2) current care (P = 0.007). Time in range during the entire study was the highest with single-hormone: 74.3% (8.0) vs. 72.0% (10.8) dual-hormone (P = 0.44).CONCLUSIONSThe addition of glucagon delivery to a closed-loop system with automated exercise detection reduces hypoglycemia in physically active adults with type 1 diabetes.

AB  - Algorithms that can determine the type of physical activity (PA) and quantify the intensity can allow precision medicine approaches, such as automated insulin delivery systems that modulate insulin administration in response to PA. In this work, data from a multi-sensor wristband is used to design classifiers to distinguish among five different physical states (PS) (resting, activities of daily living, running, biking, and resistance training), and to develop models to estimate the energy expenditure (EE) of the PA for diabetes therapy. The data collected are filtered, features are extracted from the reconciled signals, and the extracted features are used by machine learning algorithms, including deep-learning techniques, to obtain accurate PS classification and EE estimation. The various machine learning techniques have different success rates ranging from 75.7% to 94.8% in classifying the five different PS. The deep neural network model with long short-term memory has 94.8% classification accuracy. We achieved 0.5 MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) root-mean-square error for EE estimation accuracy, relative to indirect calorimetry with randomly selected testing data (10% of collected data). We also demonstrate a 5% improvement in PS classification accuracy and a 0.34 MET decrease in the mean absolute error when using multi-sensor approach relative to using only accelerometer data.

AB  - Stress is an issue that everyone experiences in today's modern life. Prolonged exposure to stress can cause many mental and physical diseases. Accordingly, the stress management issue has become popular, and the need for personal healthcare devices has increased in recent years. Therefore, the aim of this research is to design and manufacture a portable stress monitoring system, based on photoplethysmography (PPG) and galvanic skin response (GSR) physiological signals, acquired by wearable sensors. To do so, we proposed a novel algorithm for continuous measurement of the stress index (SI) as well as the classification of stress levels. In order to estimate an accurate value for SI, various soft computing algorithms such as support vector regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were adopted for modeling the stress based on the features extracted from normalized and non-normalized types of PPG and GSR signals and their combinations. Furthermore, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), ANNs, Naive Bayes, and support vector machine (SVM) were utilized to discriminate different levels of stress in subjects. The obtained results indicate that the ANFIS algorithm can estimate the SI training output with the correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.9281 and the average relative error of 0.23 on a subset of the combined features of PPG and GSR signals. Also, the best classification performance was for KNN (K=3) algorithm, with 85.3% accuracy. To evaluate the developed system, data of 16 subjects, out of the training dataset, participated in the experiment in the presence of the experts and psychologists, were used. The average CC of 0.81 and classification accuracy of 75% were obtained, using the implemented ANFIS model and KNN classifier.

AB  - diagnosis and categorization of skin cancer, as well as the difference in skin textures and injuries, is a tough undertaking. Manually detecting skin lesions from dermoscopy images seems to be a difficult and cumbersome challenge. Recent advancements in the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence for clinical applications have shown significant increase in precision and processing time. A lot of attention given to deep learning models because they are effective at identifying cancer cells. The diagnosis and accuracy levels can be greatly increased by categorizing benign and malignant dermoscopy images. This work suggests an automated classification system based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in order to precisely perform multi-classification. The DCNN's structure was thoughtfully created by arranging a number of layers that are in charge of uniquely extracting different features from skin lesions. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach to tackle the three main tasks-deep extraction of features (task1) using transfer learning, selection of features (task2)-using metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Gorilla Troop Optimization (GTO) as a feature selector, the extensive feature set is optimized, and the amount of features is reduced to within the range, and a two-level classification (task3) was proposed that are emerging in the field of skin lesion image processing. On the HAM10000 dataset, the proposed deep learning frameworks were assessed. The accuracy achieved on the dataset is 93.58 percent. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in terms of accuracy. The suggested technique is however highly scalable.

AB  - Voluntary participation of hemiplegic patients is crucial for functional electrical stimulation therapy. A wearable functional electrical stimulation system has been proposed for real-time volitional hand motor function control using the electromyography bridge method. Through a series of novel design concepts, including the integration of a detecting circuit and an analog-to-digital converter, a miniaturized functional electrical stimulation circuit technique, a low-power super-regeneration chip for wireless receiving, and two wearable armbands, a prototype system has been established with reduced size, power, and overall cost. Based on wrist joint torque reproduction and classification experiments performed on six healthy subjects, the optimized surface electromyography thresholds and trained logistic regression classifier parameters were statistically chosen to establish wrist and hand motion control with high accuracy. Test results showed that wrist flexion/extension, hand grasp, and finger extension could be reproduced with high accuracy and low latency. This system can build a bridge of information transmission between healthy limbs and paralyzed limbs, effectively improve voluntary participation of hemiplegic patients, and elevate efficiency of rehabilitation training.

AB  - The diagnosis and categorization of skin cancer, as well as the difference in skin textures and injuries, is a tough undertaking. Manually detecting skin lesions from dermoscopy images seems to be a difficult and cumbersome challenge. Recent advancements in the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence for clinical applications have shown significant increase in precision and processing time. A lot of attention is given to deep learning models because they are effective at identifying cancer cells. The diagnosis and accuracy levels can be greatly increased by categorizing benign and malignant dermoscopy images. This work suggests an automated classification system based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in order to precisely perform multi-classification. The DCNN's structure was thoughtfully created by arranging a number of layers that are in charge of uniquely extracting different features from skin lesions. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning approach to tackle the three main tasks-deep extraction of features (task1) using transfer learning, selection of features (task2)-using metaheuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Gorilla Troop Optimization (GTO) as a feature selector, the extensive feature set is optimized, and the amount of features is reduced to within the range, and a two-level classification (task3) was proposed that are emerging in the field of skin lesion image processing. On the HAM10000 dataset, the proposed deep learning frameworks were assessed. The accuracy achieved on the dataset is 93.58 percent. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in terms of accuracy. The suggested technique is however highly scalable.

AB  - Radon is a noble gas originating from the radioactive decay chain of uranium or thorium. Most radon emanates naturally from the soil and from some building materials, so it can be found in many places around the world, in particular in regions with soils containing granite or slate. It is almost impossible for a person to detect radon gas without proper tools, since it is invisible, odorless, tasteless and colorless. The problem is that a correlation has been established between the presence of high radon gas concentrations and the incidence of lung cancer. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the exposure to radon is the second most common cause of lung cancer after smoking, and it is the primary cause of lung cancer among people who have never smoked. Although there are commercial radon detectors, most of them are either expensive or provide very limited monitoring capabilities. To tackle such an issue, this article presents a cost-effective IoT radon gas remote monitoring system able to obtain accurate concentration measurements. It can also trigger events to prevent dangerous situations and to warn users about them. Moreover, the proposed solution can activate mitigation devices (e.g., forced ventilation) to decrease radon gas concentration. In order to show its performance, the system was evaluated in three different scenarios corresponding to representative buildings in Galicia (Spain), a region where high radon gas concentrations are common due to the composition of the soil. In addition, the influence of using external hardware (i.e., WiFi transceivers and an embedded System-on-Chip (SoC)) next to the radon gas sensor is studied, concluding that, in the tested scenarios, they do not interfere with the measurements.

AB  - Technological advances are transforming evidence generation in medicine; for these advances to impact public health, the clinical trial landscape must evolve and adapt to keep pace.
   Recently, advances in wearable technologies, data science and machine learning have begun to transform evidence-based medicine, offering a tantalizing glimpse into a future of next-generation 'deep' medicine. Despite stunning advances in basic science and technology, clinical translations in major areas of medicine are lagging. While the COVID-19 pandemic exposed inherent systemic limitations of the clinical trial landscape, it also spurred some positive changes, including new trial designs and a shift toward a more patient-centric and intuitive evidence-generation system. In this Perspective, I share my heuristic vision of the future of clinical trials and evidence-based medicine.

TI  - Feasibility of Wearable-Based Remote Monitoring in Patients During Intensive Treatment for Aggressive Hematologic Malignancies
T2  - JCO CLINICAL CANCER INFORMATICS
LA  - English
AB  - PURPOSE Intensive treatment protocols for aggressive hematologic malignancies harbor a high risk of serious clinical complications, such as infections. Current techniques of monitoring vital signs to detect such complications are cumbersome and often fail to diagnose them early. Continuousmonitoring of vital signs and physical activity bymeans of an upper arm medical wearable allowing 24/7 streaming of such parameters may be a promising alternative.
   METHODS This single-arm, single-center observational trial evaluated symptom-related patient-reported outcomes and feasibility of a wearable-based remote patient monitoring. All wearable data were reviewed retrospectively and were not available to the patient or clinical staff. A total of 79 patients (54 inpatients and 25 outpatients) participated and received standard-of-care treatment for a hematologic malignancy. In addition, the wearable was continuously worn and self-managed by the patient to record multiple parameters such as heart rate, oxygen saturation, and physical activity.
   RESULTS Fifty-one patients (94.4%) in the inpatient cohort and 16 (64.0%) in the outpatient cohort reported gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, and emesis), pain, dyspnea, or shivering in at least one visit. With the wearable, vital signs and physical activity were recorded for a total of 1,304.8 days. Recordings accounted for 78.0% (63.0-88.5; median [interquartile range]) of the potential recording time for the inpatient cohort and 84.6% (76.3-90.2) for the outpatient cohort. Adherence to the wearable was comparable in both cohorts, but decreased moderately over time during the trial.
   CONCLUSION A high adherence to the wearable was observed in patients on intensive treatment protocols for a hematologic malignancy who experience high symptom burden. Remote patient monitoring of vital signs and physical activity was demonstrated to be feasible and of primarily sufficient quality. (C) 2022 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - Covert atrial fibrillation (AF) accounts for cryptogenic stroke aetiology in elderly patients and in younger populations. However, asymptomatic AF is difficult to diagnose based on a short electrocardiography (ECG) recording. We evaluated the feasibility of a self-applied continuous ECG monitoring device that can record automatically, easily, and noninvasively in a younger population. We investigated community screening for asymptomatic AF using a wireless single-lead ECG with an electrode embedded in a T-shirt. One hundred men with a CHADS2 score >= 1 who were free from AF and <65 years of age were enrolled. We instructed the participants to wear ECG monitoring devices for at least 4 days/week over 2 months. The proportion of participants with newly detected AF (NDAF) and the monitoring time were evaluated. The mean CHADS2 score was 1.43 +/- 0.62. The mean patient age was 52.5 +/- 5.4 years. The mean monitoring time was 222 +/- 199 hours. NDAF continuing for >30 seconds was detected in 10 participants (10.0%). AF continuing for >6 minutes was detected in 2 participants (2.0%). The T-shirt-type wearable ECG monitoring system was suitable for continuous, daily long-term use among young people with high physical activity, and it had the distinct capability of identifying covert AF.

AB  - Background The development of optimal strategies to treat impaired mobility related to ageing and chronic disease requires better ways to detect and measure it. Digital health technology, including body worn sensors, has the potential to directly and accurately capture real-world mobility. Mobilise-D consists of 34 partners from 13 countries who are working together to jointly develop and implement a digital mobility assessment solution to demonstrate that real-world digital mobility outcomes have the potential to provide a better, safer, and quicker way to assess, monitor, and predict the efficacy of new interventions on impaired mobility. The overarching objective of the study is to establish the clinical validity of digital outcomes in patient populations impacted by mobility challenges, and to support engagement with regulatory and health technology agencies towards acceptance of digital mobility assessment in regulatory and health technology assessment decisions.
   Methods/design The Mobilise-D clinical validation study is a longitudinal observational cohort study that will recruit 2400 participants from four clinical cohorts. The populations of the Innovative Medicine Initiative-Joint Undertaking represent neurodegenerative conditions (Parkinson's Disease), respiratory disease (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), neuro-inflammatory disorder (Multiple Sclerosis), fall-related injuries, osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and frailty (Proximal Femoral Fracture). In total, 17 clinical sites in ten countries will recruit participants who will be evaluated every six months over a period of two years. A wide range of core and cohort specific outcome measures will be collected, spanning patient-reported, observer-reported, and clinician-reported outcomes as well as performance-based outcomes (physical measures and cognitive/mental measures). Daily-living mobility and physical capacity will be assessed directly using a wearable device. These four clinical cohorts were chosen to obtain generalizable clinical findings, including diverse clinical, cultural, geographical, and age representation. The disease cohorts include a broad and heterogeneous range of subject characteristics with varying chronic care needs, and represent different trajectories of mobility disability.
   Discussion The results of Mobilise-D will provide longitudinal data on the use of digital mobility outcomes to identify, stratify, and monitor disability. This will support the development of widespread, cost-effective access to optimal clinical mobility management through personalised healthcare. Further, Mobilise-D will provide evidence-based, direct measures which can be endorsed by regulatory agencies and health technology assessment bodies to quantify the impact of disease-modifying interventions on mobility.

AB  - We quantitatively measured the smiles of a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD-C) using a wearable interface device during animal-assisted activities (AAA) for 7 months, and compared the results with a control of the same age. The participant was a 10-year-old boy with ASD, and a normal healthy boy of the same age was the control. They voluntarily participated in this study. Neither child had difficulty putting on the wearable device. They kept putting on the device comfortably through the entire experiment (duration of a session was about 30-40 min). This study was approved by the Ethical Committee based on the rules established by the Institute for Developmental Research, Aichi Human Service Center. The behavior of the participants during AAA was video-recorded and coded by the medical examiner (ME). In both groups, the smiles recognized by the ME corresponded with the computer-detected smiles. In both groups, positive social behaviors increased when the smiles increased. Also, negative social behaviors decreased when the smiles increased in the (ASD-C). It is suggested that by leading the (ASD-C) into a social environment that may cause smiling, the child's social positive behaviors may be facilitated and his social negative behaviors may be decreased.

AB  - Background: Orientation deficits are among the most devastating consequences of early dementia. Digital navigation devices could overcome these deficits if adaptable to the user's needs (ie, provide situation-aware, proactive navigation assistance). To fulfill this task, systems need to automatically detect spatial disorientation from sensors in real time. Ideally, this would require field studies consisting of real-world navigation. However, such field studies can be challenging and are not guaranteed to cover sufficient instances of disorientation due to the large variability of real-world settings and a lack of control over the environment.
   Objective: Extending a foregoing field study, we aim to evaluate the feasibility of using a sophisticated virtual reality (VR) setup, which allows a more controlled observation of disorientation states and accompanying behavioral and physiological parameters in cognitively healthy older people and people with dementia.
   Methods: In this feasibility study, we described the experimental design and pilot outcomes of an ongoing study aimed at investigating the effect of disorientation on gait and selected physiological features in a virtual laboratory. We transferred a real-world navigation task to a treadmill-based virtual system for gait analysis. Disorientation was induced by deliberately manipulating landmarks in the VR projection. Associated responses in motion behavior and physiological parameters were recorded by sensors. Primary outcomes were variations in motion and physiological parameters, frequency of disorientation, and questionnaire-derived usability estimates (immersion and perceived control of the gait system) for our population of interest. At this time, the included participants were 9 cognitively healthy older participants [5/9 women, 4/9 men; mean age 70 years, SD 4.40; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) mean 29, SD 0.70) and 4 participants with dementia (2/4 women, 2/4 men; mean age 78 years, SD 2.30 years; MMSE mean 20.50, SD 7.54). Recruitment is ongoing, with the aim of including 30 cognitively healthy older participants and 20 participants with dementia.
   Results: All 13 participants completed the experiment. Patients' route was adapted by shortening it relative to the original route. Average instances of disorientation were 21.40, 36.50, and 37.50 for the cognitively healthy older control, cognitively healthy older experimental participants, and participants with dementia, respectively. Questionnaire outcomes indicated that participants experienced adequate usability and immersion; 4.30 for presence, 3.73 for involvement, and 3.85 for realism of 7 possible points, indicating a good overall ability to cope with the experiment. Variations were also observed in motion and physiological parameters during instances of disorientation.
   Conclusions: This study presents the first feasibility outcomes of a study investigating the viability of using a sophisticated VR setup, based on an earlier real-world navigation study, to study spatial disorientation among cognitively healthy older people and people with dementia. Preliminary outcomes give confidence to the notion that our setup can be used to assess motion and physiological markers of disorientation, even in people with cognitive decline.

AB  - Background: Emerging UV radiation (UVR) monitoring devices may present an opportunity to integrate such technology into skin cancer prevention interventions. However, little is known about the effects of using a wearable UVR monitor on adults' and children's sun protection-related behaviors and attitudes (eg, cancer worry and perceived risk). Understanding the potential role of reactivity and seasonal effects will help inform the use of objective monitors in the context of skin cancer prevention research, including intervention studies.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the potential reactivity associated with a wearable personal UVR monitor, specifically the effects associated with reported sun-protective behaviors and skin cancer-related attitudes, which are often the targets of skin cancer preventive interventions.
   Methods: Child-parent dyads (n=97 dyads) were asked to wear a UVR monitoring device during waking hours for 2 weeks. Participants were asked to sync the device daily with a smartphone app that stored the UVR exposure data. Participants were blinded to their UVR exposure data during the 2-week period; thus, the smartphone app provided no feedback to the participants on their UVR exposure. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing sun-protective behaviors, sunburn, tanning, skin self-examination, skin cancer-related knowledge, perceived risk, cancer worry, response efficacy, and intentions to change behaviors over the 2-week period. Linear regressions were conducted to investigate changes in the outcomes over time and to account for the role of the season of study participation.
   Results: Regression results revealed that there was a significant decrease over time for several sun protection outcomes in children, including time spent outdoors on weekends (P=.02) and weekdays (P=.008), sunscreen use (P=.03), reapplication (P<.001), and unintentional tanning (P<.001). There were no significant changes over time in children's and parents' UVR exposure, sunburn occurrence, or sun protection attitudes. Season of participation was associated with several outcomes, including lower sunscreen use (P<.001), reapplication (P<.001), sunburns (P=.01), intentions to change sun-protective behaviors (P=.02), and intentional (P=.008) and unintentional tanning (P=.01) for participants who participated in the fall versus the summer.
   Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that daily use of a UVR monitoring device over a 2-week period may result in changes in certain sun-protective behaviors. These results highlight the importance of identifying and addressing potential reactivity to UVR monitoring devices, especially in the context of skin cancer preventive intervention research. Ultimately, objectively assessed UVR exposure could be integrated into the outcome assessment for future testing of skin cancer prevention interventions.

AB  - Background Postoperative ambulation is encouraged to promote timely recovery but is rarely monitored objectively or examined as a predictor of clinical outcomes, despite growing availability of wearable devices that allow passive quantification and remote real-time monitoring of the number of steps taken during recovery.
   Purpose To determine whether the number of steps taken during inpatient recovery predicts 30- and 60-day readmission risk after metastatic cancer surgery.
   Methods Patients diagnosed with metastatic peritoneal cancer and scheduled for surgical resection were enrolled in this observational cohort study at their preoperative clinic visit. Fitbits were placed on patients' wrists upon transfer from the ICU following surgery and worn for the duration of their inpatient stay. Information about hospital readmission was extracted from electronic medical records.
   Results Seventy-one patients participated in the study (mean age = 57.14, range = 31-80 years; 42% female; 51% diagnosed with appendiceal cancer). Mean steps per day were calculated for each participant over the entire inpatient recovery period (mean stay = 12.12 days, 4-37 days). Readmission within 30 and 60 days was medically indicated for 34% and 39% of patients, respectively. After statistically adjusting for age, body mass index, comorbidity, and length of postoperative stay, higher mean steps per day predicted lower 30-day and 60-day readmission risk.
   Conclusions Higher Fitbit step counts during inpatient recovery predicted lower risk of 30- and 60-day readmission after surgery for metastatic peritoneal cancer. Results suggest that passively monitoring perioperative ambulation may identify patients at risk for readmission and highlight opportunities for behavioral intervention.

AB  - The use of biomarkers has proven utility in cardiovascular medicine and holds great promise for future advances, but their application requires considerable rigor in thinking and methodology. Numerous confounding factors can cloud the clinical and investigative uses of biomarkers. Yet, the thoughtful and critical use of biomarkers can doubtless aid discovery of new pathogenic pathways, identify novel therapeutic targets, and provide a bridge between the laboratory and the clinic. Biomarkers can provide diagnostic and prognostic tools to the practitioner. The careful application of biomarkers can also help design and guide clinical trials required to establish the efficacy of novel interventions to improve patient outcomes. Point of care testing, technological advances, such as microfluidic and wearable devices, and the power of omics approaches all promise to elevate the potential contributions of biomarkers to discovery science, translation, clinical trials, and the practice of cardiovascular medicine.

AB  - PURPOSE Performance status (PS) is a key factor in oncologic decision making, but conventional scales used to measure PS vary among observers. Consumer-grade biometric sensors have previously been identified as objective alternatives to the assessment of PS. Here, we investigate how one such biometric sensor can be used during a clinic visit to identify patients who are at risk for complications, particularly unexpected hospitalizations that may delay treatment or result in low physical activity. We aim to provide a novel and objective means of predicting tolerability to chemotherapy.
   METHODS Thirty-eight patients across three centers in the United States who were diagnosed with a solid tumor with plans for treatment with two cycles of highly emetogenic chemotherapy were included in this single-arm, observational prospective study. A noninvasive motion-capture system quantified patient movement from chair to table and during the get-up-and-walk test. Activity levels were recorded using a wearable sensor over a 2-month period. Changes in kinematics from two motion-capture data points pre- and post-treatment were tested for correlation with unexpected hospitalizations and physical activity levels as measured by a wearable activity sensor.
   RESULTS Among 38 patients (mean age, 48.3 years; 53% female), kinematic features from chair to table were the best predictors for unexpected health care encounters (area under the curve, 0.775 +/- 0.029) and physical activity (area under the curve, 0.830 +/- 0.080). Chair-to-table acceleration of the nonpivoting knee (t = 3.39; P =.002) was most correlated with unexpected health care encounters. Get-up-and-walk kinematics were most correlated with physical activity, particularly the right knee acceleration (t = -2.95; P =.006) and left arm angular velocity (t = -2.4; P =.025).
   CONCLUSION Chair-to-table kinematics are good predictors of unexpected hospitalizations, whereas the get-up-and-walk kinematics are good predictors of low physical activity. (c) 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB  - Context: There is an ongoing established need to develop engaging pain assessment strategies to provide more effective individualized care to pediatric patients with serious illnesses. This study explores the acceptability of wireless devices as one option.
   Objective: To evaluate the ability of wrist-wearable technology to collect physiological data from children with serious illnesses.
   Methods: Single-site prospective observational study conducted between September 2017 and September 2018 at Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, California, inpatient wards. Pediatric patients with diagnoses of cancer and sickle cell disease admitted to the hospital for acute-on-chronic pain and taking opioid pain medications were asked to complete two 24-hour continuous monitoring periods with the Empatica E4 wristband.
   Results: Data collected from the device correlated with manually obtained vital signs. Children responded favorably to wearing the device. Participants with reported subjective pain versus no pain had average heart rate increased by 16.4 bpm, skin temperature decreased by 3.5 degrees C, and electrodermal activity decreased by 0.27.
   Conclusions: This study shows the possibility of collecting continuous biophysical data in a nonobtrusive manner in seriously ill children experiencing acute-on-chronic pain using wearable devices. It provides the framework for larger studies to explore the utility of such data in relation to metrics of pain and suffering in this patient population.

AB  - Continuous real-time human motion and heart-rate monitoring systems can provide vital clinical information for disease diagnosis, preventive healthcare and rehabilitation care. However, it is still a challenge to design wearable pressure/strain sensors with great flexibility and sustainable power for motion detection and physiological signal monitoring. Here, a self-powered laminated fabric sensor based on Schottky contact was successfully fabricated. This laminated fabric sensor was constructed by sandwiching the polypyrrole (PPy)-coated fabric with the Ni-coated fabric and Al plastic film. The electrical outputs under strain were attributed to the single Schottky contact between PPy and Al. This fabric sensor exhibited excellent stability under continuous quick cycling operation and at high relative humidity, which could be adapted to different human body parts for continuous motion detection and heart-rate monitoring. This work is of great significance to demonstrate a promising strategy toward self-powered wearable pressure sensors used for human motion detecting and hear-rate monitoring.

AB  - Background: Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of cardiometabolic complications that are exacerbated by poor health behaviors. Critically, many survivors do not meet physical activity guidelines. Objective: The primary aim was to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of iBounce, a digital health intervention for educating and engaging survivors in physical activity. Our secondary aims were to assess the change in survivors' physical activity levels and behaviors, aerobic fitness, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after participating in the iBounce program. Methods: We recruited survivors aged 8 to 13 years who were & GE;12 months post cancer treatment completion. The app-based program involved 10 educational modules, goal setting, and home-based physical activities monitored using an activity tracker. We assessed objective physical activity levels and behaviors using cluster analysis, aerobic fitness, and HRQoL at baseline and after the intervention (week 12). Parents were trained to reassess aerobic fitness at home at follow-up (week 24). Results: In total, 30 participants opted in, of whom 27 (90%) completed baseline assessments, and 23 (77%) commenced iBounce. Our opt-in rate was 59% (30/51), and most (19/23, 83%) of the survivors completed the intervention. More than half (13/23, 57%) of the survivors completed all 10 modules (median 10, IQR 4-10). We achieved a high retention rate (19/27, 70%) and activity tracker compliance (15/19, 79%), and there were no intervention-related adverse events. Survivors reported high satisfaction with iBounce (median enjoyment score 75%; ease-of-use score 86%), but lower satisfaction with the activity tracker (median enjoyment score 60%). Parents reported the program activities to be acceptable (median score 70%), and their overall satisfaction was 60%, potentially because of technological difficulties that resulted in the program becoming disjointed. We did not observe any significant changes in physical activity levels or HRQoL at week 12. Our subgroup analysis for changes in physical activity behaviors in participants (n=11) revealed five cluster groups: most active, active, moderately active, occasionally active, and least active. Of these 11 survivors, 3 (27%) moved to a more active cluster group, highlighting their engagement in more frequent and sustained bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; 6 (56%) stayed in the same cluster; and 2 (18%) moved to a less active cluster. The survivors' mean aerobic fitness percentiles increased after completing iBounce (change +17, 95% CI 1.7-32.1; P=.03) but not at follow-up (P=.39). Conclusions: We demonstrated iBounce to be feasible for delivery and acceptable among survivors, despite some technical difficulties. The distance-delivered format provides an opportunity to engage survivors in physical activity at home and may address barriers to care, particularly for regional or remote families. We will use these pilot findings to evaluate an updated version of iBounce.

AB  - Background: Wearable sensor technology can accurately measure body motion and provide incentive feedback during exercising. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of a balance training program in older adults integrating data from wearable sensors into a human-computer interface designed for interactive training.
   Methods: Senior living community residents (mean age 84.6) with confirmed fall risk were randomized to an intervention (IG, n = 17) or control group (CG, n = 16). The IG underwent 4 weeks (twice a week) of balance training including weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing tasks with visual/auditory real-time joint movement feedback using wearable sensors. The CG received no intervention. Outcome measures included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) balance test at baseline and post-intervention. Ankle-hip postural coordination was quantified by a reciprocal compensatory index (RCI). Physical performance was quantified by the Alternate-Step-Test (AST), Timed-up-and-go (TUG), and gait assessment. User experience was measured by a standardized questionnaire.
   Results: After the intervention sway of CoM, hip, and ankle were reduced in the IG compared to the CG during both EO and EC condition (p = .007-.042). Improvement was obtained for AST (p = .037), TUG (p = .024), fast gait speed (p = . 010), but not normal gait speed (p = .264). Effect sizes were moderate for all outcomes. RCI did not change significantly. Users expressed a positive training experience including fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor-feedback.
   Conclusions: Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that older adults at risk of falling can benefit from the balance training program. Study findings may help to inform future exercise interventions integrating wearable sensors for guided game-based training in home-and community environments. Future studies should evaluate the added value of the proposed sensor-based training paradigm compared to traditional balance training programs and commercial exergames.

AB  - Various body parts or organs can be analysed to identify the different diseases in the human body. Fingernail analysis is one of the ways to identify disease in the human body. Nails are the body part which are farthest from the heart and therefore receive oxygen at last. As a result the nails are the first who show the symptoms of a disease in the human body. Fingernails can be easily captured for diagnosis and there are no heavy equipment or no specific conditions required to use nail image for disease diagnosis, like in other tests and scanning processes. Human nails deliver beneficial information about complaints or any nutritive imbalances in the human body depending upon their shape, texture and colour. In human beings, numerous systemic and skin diseases can be easily analyzed through careful examination of nails of both the limbs. A lot of nail illnesses have been found to be primary signs of numerous underlying systemic illnesses. The colour, texture or shape changes in nails are signs of many diseases mainly affecting nails. Considering all these properties of nails a system is proposed that uses digital image processing (DIP) methods for identifying such changes in the human nail to get more precise results and predict numerous diseases effortlessly. With the emerging Internet of Things (IOT) concept the generated report is made available remotely, this will help users to reduce transportation efforts. As the system has to deal with large and private data, the security of data must be ensured. To keep the data confidential, the Blockchain concept which is one of the most emerging concepts in the field of data management is used. The paper contains the implementation of the digital image processing for feature extraction of nail images, usage of IOT (ThingSpeak cloud) for data storage and implementation of Blockchain to keep the system secured and theft free.

AB  - Introduction: Few late-stage clinical trials in Parkinson's disease (PD) have produced evidence on the clinical validity of sensor-based digital measurements of daily life activities to detect responses to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess whether digital measures from patients with mild-to-moderate Lewy Body Dementia demonstrate treatment effects during a randomized Phase 2 trial. Methods: Substudy within a 12-week trial of mevidalen (placebo vs 10, 30, or 75 mg), where 70/344 patients (comparable to the overall population) wore a wrist-worn multi-sensor device.Results: Treatment effects were statistically significant by conventional clinical assessments (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] sum of Parts I-III and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change [ADCS-CGIC] scores) in the full study cohort at Week 12, but not in the substudy. However, digital measurements detected significant effects in the substudy cohort at week 6, persisting to week 12.Conclusions: Digital measurements detected treatment effects in a smaller cohort over a shorter period than conventional clinical assessments.

AB  - Background Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial did not demonstrate a significant reduction in arrhythmic death with the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD), but compliance with the device may have substantially affected the results. ThePletcher influence of WCD compliance on outcomes has not yet been fully evaluated.
   Methods Using linear and pooled logistic models, we performed as-treated analyses omitting person-time in the hospital and adjusted for correlates of WCD compliance. To assess the impact of early stopping of WCD, we performed a per-protocol Kaplan-Meier analysis, censoring after the last day the WCD was worn. Interactions of potential effect modifiers with treatment assignment and WCD compliance on outcomes were investigated. Finally, we used linear models to identify predictors of WCD compliance.
   Results A per-protocol analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in total (P < .001) and arrhythmic (P = .001) mortality. Better WCD compliance was independently predicted by cardiac arrest during index myocardial infarction (MI), higher Cr, diabetes, prior heart failure, EF <= 25%, Polish enrolling center and number of WCD alarms, while worse compliance was predicted by being divorced, Asian race, higher body mass index, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, or any WCD shock. Neither excluding time in hospital from the as-treated analysis nor adjustment for factors affecting WCD compliance materially changed the results. No variable demonstrated a significant interaction in either the intention-to-treat or as-treated analysis.
   Conclusion Robust sensitivity analyses of as-treated and per-protocol analyses suggest that the WCD is protective in compliant patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% during the first 3 months post-MI.

AB  - Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that can be life-threatening. Atrial Fibrillation (AFIB), Atrial Flutter (AFL), Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT), Sinus Tachycardia (ST), and Sinus Bradycardia (SB) are common arrhythmias that affect a growing number of patients. In this paper we describe a method to detect these arrhythmias in RR interval signals. We propose a deep learning algorithm to discriminate these fife arrhythmias and Normal Sinus Rhythm (NSR). The deep learning model was trained and tested with data from 10093 subjects. We used 10-fold cross-validation to establish the performance results. The overall accuracy for the six-class problem was 98.37%. When considering the binary problem of arrhythmia versus NSR, where the arrhythmia group is formed by combining the data from all fife arrythmias, the performance results are: Accuracy (ACC) = 98.55%, Sensitivity (SEN) = 99.40%, Specificity (SPE) = 94.30%. These results indicate that it is possible to discriminate RR interval sequences from SVT, ST, SB, AFIB, AFL, and NSR subjects with minimal error. Furthermore, the proposed model can provide a robust and independent second opinion when it comes to a decision if arrhythmia is present or not. Another positive aspect of the proposed arrhythmia detection algorithm is economic viability. RR interval signals are cost-effective to measure, communicate, and process. The discriminate powers of the proposed algorithm together with the advent of wearable technology and m-health infrastructure might lead to pervasive long-term arrhythmia monitoring. The detection results can support early diagnosis which helps to reduce the burden of the disease.

AB  - Objective
   The aim of this study was to determine the clinical significance of the anterior-posterior displacement of the center of pressure in the foot (apCoP) in post-stroke gait rehabilitation. Design
   This observational study was conducted in a tertiary hospital. Forty-two subacute post-stroke patients were included. The apCoP was measured twice with a wearable insole foot pressure measurement system, time interval more than 7 days. The results were compared between the first and second tests. The relationship between apCoP changes and spatiotemporal parameter changes were investigated. Results
   The apCoP increased significantly between tests. The change in walking speed was significantly predicted by the change in the apCoP on the less affected side. The change in asymmetry of the single support phase was significantly correlated with the change in the apCoP on the more affected side. Conclusion
   The change in apCoP provides information about the restoration of body support, body forward progression control, and propulsion in the more affected lower limb during early post-stroke rehabilitation. The apCoP can be a useful parameter for the monitoring of functional changes in the more affected lower limb during post-stroke gait rehabilitation.

AB  - In this article, we present a technical framework aimed at facilitating musical biofeedback research in poststroke movement rehabilitation. The framework comprises wireless wearable inertial sensors and software built with inexpensive and open-source tools. The software enables layered and adjustable music synthesis and has a generic movement-music mapping module. Using this, we designed digital musical interactions for balance, sit-to-stand, and gait training. Preliminary trials with subacute stroke patients indicated that the interactions were clinically feasible. Expert interviews with a focus group of clinicians were also conducted, where these interactions were deemed as meaningful and relevant to clinical protocols, with comprehensible feedback (albeit sometimes unpleasant or disturbing) for several patient types. We carried out system benchmarking, finding that the system has sufficiently short loop delays (similar to 90 ms) and a healthy sensing range (similar to 9 m) and is computationally efficient (11.1% peak CPU usage on a quad-core processor). Future studies will focus on using this framework with patients to both develop the interactions further and measure their effects on motor learning, performance retention, and psychological factors to help gauge their true clinical potential.

AB  - This paper proposes a system to generate intimations in emergencies using the internet of things and machine learning to work as a virtual agent. The idea is to learn the routine behavior of individuals inside their homes by analyzing the data gathered from door sensors and send alerts to the caregivers in case of emergencies. The application of the proposed work is limited to the individuals living alone in their houses. Thus, an older adult living alone in his house is a typical case where the proposed system is useful. Emergency consists of situations like falls and slips, strokes, or other incidents that make the subject inside the house fall unconscious. If any anomaly is detected in the usual routine, the caregivers are immediately informed by the system. Apart from emergency assessment, the paper also discusses the possibility of disease detection by subject routine analysis.

AB  - Current public health guidelines on physical activity and sleep duration are limited by a reliance on subjective self-reported evidence. Using data from simple wrist-worn activity monitors, we developed a tailored machine learning model, using balanced random forests with Hidden Markov Models, to reliably detect a number of activity modes. We show that physical activity and sleep behaviours can be classified with 87% accuracy in 159,504 minutes of recorded free-living behaviours from 132 adults. These trained models can be used to infer fine resolution activity patterns at the population scale in 96,220 participants. For example, we find that men spend more time in both low-and high-intensity behaviours, while women spend more time in mixed behaviours. Walking time is highest in spring and sleep time lowest during the summer. This work opens the possibility of future public health guidelines informed by the health consequences associated with specific, objectively measured, physical activity and sleep behaviours.

AB  - Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend that exercise is essential in the self-management of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Attending supervised interventions requiring periodic medical center visits can be difficult and patients may decline participation, whereas effective home-based exercise interventions that do not require regular medical center visits are likely to be more accessible for AS patients.
   Objective: The goal of the research was to investigate the adherence, efficacy, and safety of a wearable technology-assisted combined home-based exercise program in AS.
   Methods: This was a 16-week investigator-initiated, assessor-blinded, randomized, pilot controlled trial conducted at Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital. We enrolled patients with AS who had no regular exercise habits and had been stable in drug treatment for the preceding month. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer algorithm. An exercise program consisting of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise and functional exercise was given to the patients in the intervention group. The exercise intensity was controlled by a Mio FUSE Heart Rate Monitor wristband, which uses photoplethysmography to measure heart rate. Patients in the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the difference in the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS). The secondary outcomes were patient global assessment (PGA), physician global assessment (PhGA), total pain, nocturnal pain, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), BAS Functional Index (BASFI), BAS Metrology Index (BASMI), Spondyloarthritis International Society Health Index (ASAS HI), 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2) max, body composition, range of motion of joints, and muscle endurance tests. Retention rate, adherence rate, barriers to being active, and adverse events were also assessed.
   Results: A total of 77 patients were screened, of whom 55 (71%) patients were enrolled; 2% (1/55) withdrew without treatment after randomization. Patients were assigned to the intervention (n=26) or control group (n=28). The median adherence rate of the prescribed exercise protocol was 84.2% (IQR 48.7%-97.9%). For the primary outcome, between-group difference of ASDAS was significant, favoring the intervention (-0.2, 95% CI -0.4 to 0.02, P=.03). For the secondary outcomes, significant between-group differences at 16 weeks were detected in PGA, PhGA, total pain, BASDAI, BASDAI-fatigue, BASDAI-spinal pain, BASDAI-morning stiffness intensity, BASFI, and BASMI. Moreover, the frequency of difficulty in ASAS HI-motivation at 16 weeks was less in the intervention group (P=.03). Between-group difference for change from baseline were also detected in VO2 max, SF-36, back extensor endurance test, and the range of motion of cervical lateral flexion at 16 weeks. Lack of time, energy, and willpower were the most distinct barriers to being active. Incidences of adverse events were similar between groups (P=.11).
   Conclusions: Our pilot study suggests that this technology-assisted combined home-based exercise program can improve the clinical outcomes of patients with AS who have no exercise habit, with good adherence and safety profile.

AB  - Realizing an untethered, low-cost, and comfortably wearable respiratory rate sensor for long-term breathing monitoring application still remains a challenge. In this paper, a conductive-textile-based wearable respiratory rate sensing technique based on the capacitive sensing approach is proposed. The sensing unit consists of two conductive textile electrodes that can be easily fabricated, laminated, and integrated in garments. Respiration cycle is detected by measuring the capacitance of two electrodes placed on the inner anterior and posterior sides of a T-shirt at either the abdomen or chest position. A convenient wearable respiratory sensor setup with a capacitance-to-voltage converter has been devised. Respiratory rate as well as breathing mode can be accurately identified using the designed sensor. The sensor output provides significant information on respiratory flow. The effectiveness of the proposed system for different breathing patterns has been evaluated by experiments. (C) 2013 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

TI  - Association of Wearable Device Use With Pulse Rate and Health Care Use in Adults With Atrial Fibrillation
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN

KW  - PROPENSITY SCORE
AB  - IMPORTANCE Increasingly, individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) use wearable devices (hereafter wearables) that measure pulse rate and detect arrhythmia. The associations of wearables with health outcomes and health care use are unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To characterize patients with AF who use wearables and compare pulse rate and health care use between individuals who use wearables and those who do not.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study included 90 days of follow-up of patients in a tertiary care, academic health system. Included patients were adults with at least 1AF-specific International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code from 2017 through 2019. Electronic medical records were reviewed to identify 125 individuals who used wearables and had adequate pulse-rate follow-up who were then matched using propensity scores 4 to 1 with 500 individuals who did not use wearables. Data were analyzed from June 2020 through February 2021.
   EXPOSURE Using commercially available wearables with pulse rate or rhythm evaluation capabilities.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean pulse rates from measures taken in the clinic or hospital and a composite health care use score were recorded. The composite outcome included evaluation and management, ablation, cardioversion, telephone encounters, and number of rate or rhythm control medication orders.
   RESULTS Among 16 320 patients with AF included in the analysis, 348 patients used wearables and 15 972 individuals did not use wearables. Prior to matching, patients using wearables were younger (mean [SD] age, 64.0 [13.0] years vs 70.0 [13.8] years; P < .001) and healthier (mean [SD] CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 65 years or 65-74 years, diabetes, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, sex] score, 3.6 [2.0] vs 4.4 [2.0]; P < .001) compared with individuals not using wearables, with similar gender distribution (148 [42.5%] women vs 6722 women [42.1%]; P = .91). After matching, mean pulse rate was similar between 125 patients using wearables and 500 patients not using wearables (75.01 [95% CI, 72.74-77.27] vs 75.79 [95% CI, 74.68-76.90] beats per minute [bpm]; P = .54), whereas mean composite use score was higher among individuals using wearables (3.55 [95% CI, 3.31-3.80] vs 3.27 [95% CI, 3.14-3.40]; P = .04). Among measures in the composite outcome, there was a significant difference in use of ablation, occurring in 22 individuals who used wearables (17.6%) vs 37 individuals who did not use wearables (7.4%) (P = .001). In the regression analyses, mean composite use score was 0.28 points (95% CI, 0.01 to 0.56 points) higher among individuals using wearables compared with those not using wearables and mean pulse was similar, with a -0.79 bpm (95% CI -3.28 to 1.71 bpm) difference between the groups.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study found that follow-up health care use among individuals with AF was increased among those who used wearables compared with those with similar pulse rates who did not use wearables. Given the increasing use of wearables by patients with AF, prospective, randomized, long-term evaluation of the associations of wearable technology with health outcomes and healthcare use is needed.

AB  - Purpose Ambulatory activity (walking) is affected after sarcoma surgery yet is not routinely assessed. Small inexpensive accelerometers could bridge the gap. Study objectives investigated, whether in patients with lower extremity musculoskeletal tumours: (A) it was feasible to conduct ambulatory activity assessments in patient's homes using an accelerometer-based wearable (AX3, Axivity). (B) AX3 assessments produced clinically useful data, distinguished tumour sub-groups and related to existing measures. Methods In a prospective cross-sectional pilot, 34 patients with musculoskeletal tumours in the femur/thigh (19), pelvis/hip (3), tibia/leg (9), or ankle/foot (3) participated. Twenty-seven had limb-sparing surgery and seven amputation. Patients were assessed using a thigh-worn monitor. Summary measures of volume (total steps/day, total ambulatory bouts/day, mean bout length), pattern (alpha), and variability (S-2) of ambulatory activity were derived. Results AX3 was well-tolerated and feasible to use. Outcomes compared to literature but did not distinguish tumour sub-groups. Alpha negatively correlated with disability (walking outside (r=-418, p = 0.042*), social life (r=-0.512, p = 0.010*)). Disability negatively predicted alpha (unstandardised co-efficient= -0.001, R-2=0.186, p = 0.039*). Conclusions A wearable can assess novel attributes of walking; volume, pattern, and variability after sarcoma surgery. Such outcomes provide valuable information about people's physical performance in their homes, which can guide rehabilitation.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic seriousness is making the whole world suffer due to inefficient medication and vaccines. The article prediction analysis is carried out with the dataset downloaded from the Application peripheral interface (API) designed explicitly for COVID-19 quarantined patients. The measured data is collected from a wearable device used for quarantined healthy and unhealthy patients. The wearable device provides data of temperature, heart rate, SPO2, blood saturation, and blood pressure timely for alerting the medical authorities and providing a better diagnosis and treatment. The dataset contains 1085 patients with eight features representing 490 COVID19 infected and 595 standard cases. The work considers different parameters, namely heart rate, temperature, SpO(2), bpm parameters, and health status.& nbsp;Furthermore, the real-time data collected can predict the health status of patients as infected and non infected from measured parameters. The collected dataset uses a random forest classifier with linear and polynomial regression to train and validate COVID-19 patient data. The google colab is an Integral development environment inbuilt with python and Jupyter notebook with scikit-learn version 0.22.1 virtually tested on cloud coding tools. The dataset is trained and tested in 80% and 20% ratio for accuracy evaluation and avoid overfitting in the model. This analysis could help medical authorities and governmental agencies of every country respond timely and reduce the contamination of the disease.& nbsp;The measured data provide a comprehensive mapping of disease symptoms to predict the health status. They can restrict the virus transmission and take necessary steps to control, mitigate and manage the disease.& nbsp;& nbsp;Benefits in scientific research with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tackle the hurdles in analyzing disease diagnosis.& nbsp;& nbsp;The diagnosis results of disease symptoms can identify the severity of the patient to monitor and manage the difficulties for the outbreak caused.

AB  - Low levels of uric acid and tyrosine in sweat are detected in patients with gout and healthy individuals with an entirely laser-engraved wearable sensor.
   Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to provide continuous measurements of useful biomarkers. However, current sensors cannot accurately detect low analyte concentrations, lack multimodal sensing or are difficult to fabricate at large scale. We report an entirely laser-engraved sensor for simultaneous sweat sampling, chemical sensing and vital-sign monitoring. We demonstrate continuous detection of temperature, respiration rate and low concentrations of uric acid and tyrosine, analytes associated with diseases such as gout and metabolic disorders. We test the performance of the device in both physically trained and untrained subjects under exercise and after a protein-rich diet. We also evaluate its utility for gout monitoring in patients and healthy controls through a purine-rich meal challenge. Levels of uric acid in sweat were higher in patients with gout than in healthy individuals, and a similar trend was observed in serum.

AB  - A standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important tool in the diagnosis of heart diseases. Here, Ag/AgCl electrodes with conductive gels are usually used in a 12-lead ECG system to access biopotentials. However, using Ag/AgCl electrodes with conductive gels might be inconvenient in a prehospital setting. In previous studies, several dry electrodes have been developed to improve this issue. However, these dry electrodes have contact with the skin directly, and they might be still unsuitable for patients with wounds. In this study, a wearable 12-lead electrocardiogram monitoring system was proposed to improve the above issue. Here, novel noncontact electrodes were also designed to access biopotentials without contact with the skin directly. Moreover, by using the mechanical design, this system allows the user to easily wear and take off the device and to adjust the locations of the noncontact electrodes. The experimental results showed that the proposed system could exactly provide a good ECG signal quality even while walking and could detect the ECG features of the patients with myocardial ischemia, installation pacemaker, and ventricular premature contraction.

AB  - In the near future, as a consequence of the increasing percentage of elder people with respect to the total population, developed countries will face significant stress on their healthcare systems. The onset of some diseases associated with aging, such as dementia or cognitive decline, has been associated with a number of factors that can be detected in advance, thus offering the possibility of an early intervention to delay their onset. Specifically, several studies have shown a correlation between slower gait speed and serious cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. In this work we present a method, based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), capable of detecting the user's walking speed in a continuous and non-invasive way, providing a useful tool for the monitoring and early detection of this type of diseases. The proposed method estimates the gait speed with an average error of less than 10 cm/s, and is capable of providing continuous non-invasive monitoring of the gait speed of users while they conduct their usual life routines, without any additional requirements other than wearing a smartwatch or an activity band with inertial sensors and BLE capabilities.
