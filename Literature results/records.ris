N2  - Background: The detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in stroke survivors is critical to decreasing the risk of recurrent stroke. Smartwatches have emerged as a convenient and accurate means of AF diagnosis; however, the impact on critical patient-reported outcomes, including anxiety, engagement, and quality of life, remains ill defined. Objectives: To examine the association between smartwatch prescription for AF detection and the patient-reported outcomes of anxiety, patient activation, and self-reported health. Methods: We used data from the Pulsewatch trial, a 2-phase randomized controlled trial that included participants aged 50 years or older with a history of ischemic stroke. Participants were randomized to use either a proprietary smartphone-smartwatch app for 30 days of AF monitoring or no cardiac rhythm monitoring. Validated surveys were deployed before and after the 30-day study period to assess anxiety, patient activation, and self-rated physical and mental health. Logistic regression and generalized estimation equations were used to examine the association between smartwatch prescription for AF monitoring and changes in the patient-reported outcomes. Results: A total of 110 participants (mean age 64 years, 41% female, 91% non-Hispanic White) were studied. Seventy percent of intervention participants were novice smartwatch users, as opposed to 84% of controls, and there was no significant difference in baseline rates of anxiety, activation, or self-rated health between the 2 groups. The incidence of new AF among smartwatch users was 6%. Participants who were prescribed smartwatches did not have a statistically significant change in anxiety, activation, or self-reported health as compared to those who were not prescribed smartwatches. The results held even after removing participants who received an AF alert on the watch. Conclusion: The prescription of smartwatches to stroke survivors for AF monitoring does not adversely affect key patient-reported outcomes. Further research is needed to better inform the successful deployment of smartwatches in clinical practice.

N2  - Actigraphy is a tool used to describe limb motor activity. Some actigraphic parameters, namely Motor Activity (MA) and Asymmetry Index (AR), correlate with stroke severity. However, a long-lasting actigraphic monitoring was never performed previously. We hypothesized that MA and AR can describe different clinical conditions during the evolution of the acute phase of stroke. We conducted a multicenter study and enrolled 69 stroke patients. NIHSS was assessed every hour and upper limbs’ motor activity was continuously recorded. We calculated MA and AR in the first hour after admission, after a significant clinical change (NIHSS ± 4) or at discharge. In a control group of 17 subjects, we calculated MA and AR normative values. We defined the best model to predict clinical status with multiple linear regression and identified actigraphic cut-off values to discriminate minor from major stroke (NIHSS ≥ 5) and NIHSS 5–9 from NIHSS ≥ 10. The AR cut-off value to discriminate between minor and major stroke (namely NIHSS ≥ 5) is 27% (sensitivity = 83%, specificity = 76% (AUC 0.86 p < 0.001), PPV = 89%, NPV = 42%). However, the combination of AR and MA of the non-paretic arm is the best model to predict NIHSS score (R2: 0.482, F: 54.13), discriminating minor from major stroke (sensitivity = 89%, specificity = 82%, PPV = 92%, NPV = 75%). The AR cut-off value of 53% identifies very severe stroke patients (NIHSS ≥ 10) (sensitivity = 82%, specificity = 74% (AUC 0.86 p < 0.001), PPV = 73%, NPV = 82%). Actigraphic parameters can reliably describe the overall severity of stroke patients with motor symptoms, supporting the addition of a wearable actigraphic system to the multi-parametric monitoring in stroke units.

N2  - A single-blind double-dummy randomized study was conducted in diagnosed patients (n = 66) to compare the efficacy of Linseeds (Linum usitatissimum L.), Psyllium (Plantago ovata Forssk.), and honey in uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease (uPID) with standard drugs using experimental and computational analysis. The pessary group received placebo capsules orally twice daily plus a per vaginum cotton pessary of powder from linseeds and psyllium seeds, each weighing 3 gm, with honey (5 mL) at bedtime. The standard group received 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily and 400 mg of metronidazole TID orally plus a placebo cotton pessary per vaginum at bedtime for 14 days. The primary outcomes were clinical features of uPID (vaginal discharge, lower abdominal pain (LAP), low backache (LBA), and pelvic tenderness. The secondary outcomes included leucocytes (WBCs) in vaginal discharge on saline microscopy and the SF-12 health questionnaire. In addition, we also classified both (pessary and standard) groups using machine learning models such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and AdaBoost (AB). The pessary group showed a higher percentage reduction than the standard group in abnormal vaginal discharge (87.05% vs. 77.94%), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)-LAP (80.57% vs. 77.09%), VAS-LBA (74.19% vs. 68.54%), McCormack pain scale (McPS) score for pelvic tenderness (75.39% vs. 67.81%), WBC count of vaginal discharge (87.09% vs. 83.41%) and improvement in SF-12 HRQoL score (94.25% vs. 86.81%). Additionally, our DT 5-fold model achieved the maximum accuracy (61.80%) in the classification. We propose that the pessary group is cost-effective, safer, and more effective as standard drugs for treating uPID and improving the HRQoL of women. Aucubin, Plantamajoside, Herbacetin, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, Secoisolariciresinol Monoglucoside, and other various natural bioactive molecules of psyllium and linseeds have beneficial effects as they possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory properties. The anticipated research work is be a better alternative treatment for genital infections.

N2  - Serious clinical complications (SCC; CTCAE grade ≥ 3) occur frequently in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management.

N2  - Objective:Investigate if changes in objective sleep quality index (SQI) assessed through cardiopulmonary-coupling analysis impacts blood pressure (BP) in patients with obstructive sleep apnea at high-cardiovascular risk.Methods:Secondary analysis of ECG and pulse-oximetry-[oxygen saturation (SpO2)] data from the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment study, multicenter, controlled trial in patients with cardiovascular disease and moderate-severe obstructive sleep apnea, randomly assigned to intervention of healthy lifestyle and sleep hygiene education (HLSE; control group), continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or nocturnal supplemental oxygen (NSO). Participants with good-quality ECG-signal and SpO2-signal (n = 241) were included.Results:CPAP-Therapy significantly improved BP, with net average improvement in mean arterial blood pressure during sleep (MAPSleep) when compared with nocturnal supplemental oxygen-Therapy or healthy lifestyle and sleep education-Therapy,-3.92 (P = 0.012) and-3.83 (P = 0.016), respectively. When stratified on the basis of baseline-SQI, CPAP-Therapy improves 24-h MAP24-3.02 (P = 0.030) and MAPSleep-5.00 (P = 0.001), in patients with compromised baseline-SQI (SQI < 55). Stratifying the cohort based on changes in SQI during the study period (SQIBaseline-SQIFollow-up), controlling for sex, age over 60, apnea-hypopnea index, SpO2less than 80%, baseline BP and cardiovascular disease, significant differences are observed comparing the groups that Improved-SQI (SQIBaseline < 55, SQIFollow-up ≥ 55) and Declined-SQI (SQIBaseline ≥ 55, SQIFollow-up < 55) in MAP24-4.87 (P = 0.046) and mean diastolic blood pressure (MDP24)-4.42 (P = 0.026) as well as MAPWake-6.36 (P = 0.015), mean systolic blood pressure wake (MSPWake)-7.80 (P = 0.048) and MDPWake-5.64 (P = 0.009), respectively. Improved SQI reflects the magnitude of positive effect on BP which is reached mostly through initiation of CPAP-Therapy.Conclusion:Cardiopulmonary coupling-derived sleep quality impacted 24-h MAP and MDP, as well as BP during wake, in patients participating in the Heart Biomarker Evaluation in Apnea Treatment-study.

N2  - Background: Obesity is a major risk factor for a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, thus work on obesity care related topics is highly connected to further urgent global health related challenges [1-3]. This research is part of the STOP project, a H2020 RISE project funded by European Commission (GA No 823978) to address the challenge of preventing obesity in Europe [4]. The interdisciplinary European STOP project aims to establish a data and knowledge ecosystem as a basis for the STOP Portal to enable healthcare professionals in decision support, and persons with obesity in analysis and feedback of health information to optimise healthy nutrition. The aim of this current randomised controlled trial (RCT) was to determine the effectiveness of the newly developed system for adults with overweight and obesity to lose weight. Methods: This was a pilot two-arm RCT: 1. intervention (n=15) and 2. control (n=15). All the participants were adults with overweight or obesity. The intervention group used the STOP Portal, while the control group did not use this system, no intervention. Participants were randomised into one of the two groups using a computer randomised programme. The primary outcome was percentage reported weight loss, including 10% weight loss by three months. Four data collection points for both the intervention and control groups at 1. baseline (month 0); 2. month 1; 3. month 2; and 4. month 3. Regardless, of what group the participants were in, their weight and height were recorded at each of these four data collection points. The STOP Portal collects the following data: physiological data, knowledge resources, biomedical data, self-reporting activity and food data. Ethical approval was obtained. Results: A total of 30 adults registered for this pilot RCT and participated up to three months. From the preliminary results so far, it suggests that the STOP Portal can collect data on self-reporting activity and food data, and thus aiding weight lost. It was found that the STOP Portal could provide better support or motivate users better if the users are using wearable wrist bands or apps in monitoring the activities. Conclusion: Overall, the STOP Portal has potential and is deemed acceptable and is fit for purpose to collect data on self-reporting activity and food data, and contribute to weight management. This project addresses obesity management and prevention through the foundation of an innovative platform to support persons with obesity with a better nutrition under supervision of healthcare professionals.

N2  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention, HerBeat, compared with educational usual care (E-UC) for improving exercise capacity (EC) and other patient-reported outcomes at 3 mo among women with coronary heart disease. METHODS: Women were randomized to the HerBeat group (n = 23), a behavior change mHealth intervention with a smartphone, smartwatch, and health coach or to the E-UC group (n = 24) who received a standardized cardiac rehabilitation workbook. The primary endpoint was EC measured with the 6-min walk test (6MWT). Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular disease risk factors and psychosocial well-being. RESULTS: A total of 47 women (age 61.2 ± 9.1 yr) underwent randomization. The HerBeat group significantly improved on the 6MWT from baseline to 3 mo (P = .016, d = .558) while the E-UC group did not (P = .894, d =-0.030). The between-group difference of 38 m at 3 mo was not statistically significant. From baseline to 3 mo, the HerBeat group improved in anxiety (P = .021), eating habits confidence (P = .028), self-efficacy for managing chronic disease (P = .001), diastolic blood pressure (P = .03), general health perceptions (P = .047), perceived bodily pain (P = .02), and waist circumference (P = .008) while the E-UC group showed no improvement on any outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The mHealth intervention led to improvements in EC and several secondary outcomes from baseline to 3 mo while the E-UC intervention did not. A larger study is required to detect small differences between groups. The implementation and outcomes evaluation of the HerBeat intervention was feasible and acceptable with minimal attrition.

N2  - Background: Although the first few months after acute myocardial infarction (MI) are associated with an increased risk of SCD, in particular when LVEF is ≤0.35, prophylactic ICDs are not recommended until LVEF has been reassessed after a period of 40 to 90 days following an acute MI. During this ‘waiting period’, wearable cardioverter defibrillators (WCD) may be used in patients considered at high-risk of SCD, but the prognostic significance of sustained VT/VF occurring under WCD protection is unknown. Objective: We sought to evaluate whether the occurrence of VT/VF, successfully treated by a WCD in the early post-MI phase, is associated with a poorer outcome with regard to death or VT/VF recurrences at one year. Methods: We recruited a series of patients with an acute MI and a resulting LVEF≤0.35 (evaluated 2-5 days after admission) who were prescribed a WCD upon hospital discharge (for a maximal expected duration of 3 months) and who were subsequently implanted with an ICD either because sustained VT/VF occurred while on WCD (Group A) or because LVEF remained ≤0.35 after the post-MI ‘waiting period’ (Group B). Informed consent was mandatory to participate in the study. Adjudication of arrhythmic events was based on the analysis of ICD/WCD recordings. Based on previous publications, eleven relevant clinical parameters (associated with a higher risk of SCD after MI) were assessed for statistical analysis in addition to the occurrence of VT/VF while on WCD. Results: The study population consisted of 1032 consecutive patients (Group A: n=72, Group B: n=960) from 41 French centers. The median follow-up after ICD implantation was 2.6 years [interquartile range=1.5-3.9]. The clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1. At one year: 1) VT/VF requiring ICD treatment occurred in 22.2% vs 3.5% (p<0.0001) respectively in Group A and Group B patients and 2) death from any cause occurred in 11.1% vs 3.4% (p=0.001) respectively in Group A and Group B patients (Figure 1). Occurrence of VT/VF while on WCD was independently associated with the occurrence of VT/VF and all-cause death after ICD implantation. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the occurrence of VT/VF, while on WCD in the early post-MI period after an acute MI, is an independent marker of a poorer one-year prognosis in patients with a LVEF≤0.35. Further studies are needed to assess which therapeutic strategies might improve the short-term prognosis in these patients. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]

N2  - Background: Valbenazine is a highly selective vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor approved for treatment of tardive dyskinesia. To address the ongoing need for improved symptomatic treatments for individuals with Huntington's disease, valbenazine was evaluated for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease. Methods: KINECT-HD (NCT04102579) was a phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, performed in 46 Huntington Study Group sites in the USA and Canada. The study included adults with genetically confirmed Huntington's disease and chorea (Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale [UHDRS] Total Maximal Chorea [TMC] score of 8 or higher) who were randomly assigned (1:1) via an interactive web response system (with no stratification or minimisation) to oral placebo or valbenazine (≤80 mg, as tolerated) for 12 weeks of double-blinded treatment. The primary endpoint was a least-squares mean change in UHDRS TMC score from the screening and baseline period (based on the average of screening and baseline values for each participant) to the maintenance period (based on the average of week 10 and 12 values for each participant) in the full-analysis set using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Safety assessments included treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, laboratory tests, clinical tests for parkinsonism, and psychiatric assessments. The double-blind placebo-controlled period of KINECT-HD has been completed, and an open-label extension period is ongoing. Findings: KINECT-HD was performed from Nov 13, 2019, to Oct 26, 2021. Of 128 randomly assigned participants, 125 were included in the full-analysis set (64 assigned to valbenazine, 61 assigned to placebo) and 127 were included in the safety-analysis set (64 assigned to valbenazine, 63 assigned to placebo). The full-analysis set included 68 women and 57 men. Least-squares mean changes from the screening and baseline period to the maintenance period in the UHDRS TMC score were –4·6 for valbenazine and –1·4 for placebo (least-squares mean difference –3·2, 95% CI –4·4 to –2·0; p<0·0001). The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse event was somnolence (ten [16%] with valbenazine, two [3%] with placebo). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in two participants in the placebo group (colon cancer and psychosis) and one participant in the valbenazine group (angioedema because of allergic reaction to shellfish). No clinically important ch anges in vital signs, electrocardiograms, or laboratory tests were found. No suicidal behaviour or worsening of suicidal ideation was reported in participants treated with valbenazine. Interpretation: In individuals with Huntington's disease, valbenazine resulted in improvement in chorea compared with placebo and was well tolerated. Continued research is needed to confirm the long-term safety and effectiveness of this medication throughout the disease course in individuals with Huntington's disease-related chorea.

N2  - Introduction: Motor impairments are the objectively most striking sequelae after stroke, but non-motor consequences represent a high burden for stroke survivors as well. Depression is reported in one third of patients, the fatigue prevalence ranges from 23 to 75% due to heterogenous definitions and assessments. Cognitive impairment is found in one third of stroke patients 3–12 months after stroke and the risk for dementia is doubled by the event. Aerobic exercise has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms, counteract fatigue, and improve cognitive functions in non-stroke patients. Furthermore, exercise is known to strengthen the immune system. It is unknown, though, if aerobic exercise can counteract poststroke depression, fatigue, poststroke dementia and poststroke immunosuppression. Therefore, we aim to analyse the effect of aerobic exercise on functional recovery, cognition, emotional well-being, and the immune system. Reorganization of topological networks of the brain shall be visualized by diffusion MRI fibre tracking. Methods: Adults with mild to moderate stroke impairment (initial NIHSS or NIHSS determined at the moment of maximal deterioration 1–18) are recruited within two weeks of stroke onset. Study participants must be able to walk independently without risk of falling. All patients are equipped with wearable devices (smartwatches) measuring the heart rate and daily step count. The optimal heart rate zone is determined by lactate ergometry at baseline. Patients are randomized to the control or the intervention group, the latter performing a heart rate-controlled walking training on own initiative 5 times a week for 45 min. All patients receive medical care and stroke rehabilitation to the usual standard of care. The following assessments are conducted at baseline and after 90 days: Fugl Meyer-assessment for the upper and lower extremity, 6 min-walk test, neuropsychological assessment (cognition: MoCA, SDMT; fatigue and depression: FSMC, HADS-D, participation: WHODAS 2.0 12-items), blood testing (i.e. immune profiling to obtain insights into phenotype and functional features of distinct immune-cell subsets) and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with grid-sampled diffusion weighted imaging, white matter fibre tracking and MR spectroscopy. Perspective: This study investigates the effect of smartwatch-controlled aerobic exercise on functional recovery, cognition, emotional well-being, the immune system, and neuronal network reorganization in stroke patients.

N2  - Background: Several studies have reported on the feasibility of electronic (e-)monitoring using computers or smartphones in patients with mental disorders, including bipolar disorder (BD). While studies on e-monitoring have examined the role of demographic factors, such as age, gender, or socioeconomic status and use of health apps, to our knowledge, no study has examined clinical characteristics that might impact adherence with e-monitoring in patients with BD. We analyzed adherence to e-monitoring in patients with BD who participated in an ongoing e-monitoring study and evaluated whether demographic and clinical factors would predict adherence. Methods: Eighty-seven participants with BD in different phases of the illness were included. Patterns of adherence for wearable use, daily and weekly self-rating scales over 15 months were analyzed to identify adherence trajectories using growth mixture models (GMM). Multinomial logistic regression models were fitted to compute the effects of predictors on GMM classes. Results: Overall adherence rates were 79.5% for the wearable; 78.5% for weekly self-ratings; and 74.6% for daily self-ratings. GMM identified three latent class subgroups: participants with (i) perfect; (ii) good; and (iii) poor adherence. On average, 34.4% of participants showed “perfect” adherence; 37.1% showed “good” adherence; and 28.2% showed poor adherence to all three measures. Women, participants with a history of suicide attempt, and those with a history of inpatient admission were more likely to belong to the group with perfect adherence. Conclusions: Participants with higher illness burden (e.g., history of admission to hospital, history of suicide attempts) have higher adherence rates to e-monitoring. They might see e-monitoring as a tool for better documenting symptom change and better managing their illness, thus motivating their engagement.

N2  - Study objective:Current hypertension guidelines recommend that at-risk individuals be screened for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The Belun Ring is a wearable OSA diagnostic device worn on the palmar side of the proximal phalanx of the index finger.Methods:We recruited 129 participants (age: 60±8years, male sex: 88%, BMI: 27±4kg/m2) with hypertension and high cardiovascular risk for a simultaneous polysomnography and Belun Ring monitoring for one night. Epworth Sleepiness Scale score more than 10 was detected in 27 (21.0%) participants.Results:In the 127 participants who completed the study, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) derived from polysomnography was 18.1 (interquartile range: 33.0) events/h and that derived from the Belun Ring was 19.5 (interquartile range: 23.3) events/h [intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.882, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.837-0.916]. A Bland-Altman plot showed the difference between the Belun Ring and polysomnography AHIs to be-1.3±10.4events/h. Area under the receiver operating characteristic for the Belun Ring AHI was 0.961 (95% CI: 0.932-0.990, P<0.001). When the Belun Ring AHI of at least 15events/h was used to diagnose OSA, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 95.7, 77.6, 85.3, and 93.8%, respectively. The overall accuracy was 87.4%. The Cohen's kappa agreement was 0.74±0.09 (P<0.001). Similar results were obtained when the oxygen desaturation index was used to diagnose OSA.Conclusion:A high prevalence of OSA was detected in patients with hypertension and high cardiovascular risk. The Belun Ring is a reliable device for OSA diagnosis similar to polysomnography.

N2  - Background: Consumer-facing wearable devices have dedicated algorithms to detect AF that rely on identifying irregular R-R intervals. Regular atrial arrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardias (AT) and atrial flutters, which may also benefit from anticoagulation, may remain undetected. Objective: We sought to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the Apple Watch (APW) Series 6 and the CART-I ring’s (C-ring) in detecting atrial arrhythmias (AF, AT, and atrial flutter). Methods: In this single-centre prospective study, participants underwent simultaneous 12-lead ECG recordings with a 30-second single-lead wearable device ECG. The order of devices was randomly assigned. Two cardiologists independently adjudicated all ECGs; any disagreements were resolved by a third cardiologist. The wearable devices’ algorithm labelled ECGs as "AF," "Not AF," or "Unclassified." Diagnostic accuracy for each device was determined by calculating the sensitivity and specificity for atrial arrhythmias and comparing them by using McNemar’s and Fisher tests. Results: We enrolled 400 consecutive patients. Seven patients had suboptimal 12-lead ECGs and were excluded from the analysis. Baseline demographics are depicted in Table 1. AF was seen in 166 patients, and 39 had an AT/atrial flutter. Automated detection of AT/AF flutter was poor in both devices (Table 2). In patients with atrial flutter, the APW algorithm classified 6 (15%) as AF, 17 (44%) as sinus rhythm, and 16 (41%) as unclassified. The C-ring had similar results, with just 33% of cases being classified as AF. Physician-interpreted ECGs from the APW identified a higher number of atrial flutters than the C-ring (13 vs. 25, p = 0.01), but many were incorrectly classified as AF. If all ECGs were included, the C-ring automatic detection for atrial arrhythmias (AF and atrial flutter) was significantly higher than the APW, at 57.6%(95%CI:50.7%–64.1%) and 77.0%(95% CI:70.9%–82.3%), respectively. The APW atrial arrhythmia sensitivity increased following the exclusion of unclassified ECGs but was still lower than the C-ring (mean difference 10.3%, p=0.012). Physician-interpreted ECGs had a high sensitivity for atrial arrhythmias (94.1% APW and 91.7% C-ring, p = 0.44). There was no significant difference in specificity between automated detection and physician interpretation. Conclusion: The sensitivity of automated detection of regular atrial arrhythmias is low. Physician-interpreted ECGs have excellent overall accuracy for atrial arrhythmia, but many are mislabeled as AF. [Formula presented] [Formula presented]

N2  - Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death both globally and in the United Arab Emirates. Despite public health measures and health education, the rates of death from CVD remain stable. Barriers previously identified to lifestyle changes include cultural reasons, boredom, and lack of family support. The Emirates Heart Health Project (EHHP) seeks to support healthy lifestyle changes through a family-based intervention using a health coach and fitness tracker. Methods and analysis The EHHP is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial with each cluster comprised of members of an extended family. Eligible participants will be ≥ 18 years of age, with BMI ≥ 25, have Emirati citizenship and be able to give informed consent for study participation. The cluster will have 16 weekly teaching sessions in the participants' family home by a health coach who will review individual weight, diet and exercise (monitored by a wearable fitness tracker). The clusters will have pre-intervention assessments of their weight and CVD risk profile and enter the intervention in randomized order. Each cluster will have a post-intervention assessment of the same measures. The primary outcome is weight reduction from baseline. Secondary outcomes will include change in CVD risk factors such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, waist circumference, and BMI. A mixed linear model will be used for analysis, where the parameters measured at the end of each 16-week episode will be the outcome values. These will be analyzed such that baseline values (measured just prior to the start of an episode) will be fixed covariables. Random effects are the family units. This trial has been registered with the NIH at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04688684) and is being reported using the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) and TIDieR (Template for intervention description and replication) framework.

N2  - Background: Autism entails reduced communicative abilities. Approximately 30% of individuals with autism have intellectual disability (ID). Some people with autism and ID are virtually non-communicative and unable to notify their caregivers when they are in pain. In a pilot study, we showed that heart rate (HR) monitoring may identify painful situations in this patient group, as HR increases in acutely painful situations. Objectives: This study aims to generate knowledge to reduce the number of painful episodes in non-communicative patients’ everyday lives. We will 1) assess the effectiveness of HR as a tool for identifying potentially painful care procedures, 2) test the effect of HR-informed changes in potentially painful care procedures on biomarkers of pain, and 3) assess how six weeks of communication through HR affects the quality of communication between patient and caregiver. Methods: We will recruit 38 non-communicative patients with autism and ID residing in care homes. Assessments: HR is measured continuously to identify acutely painful situations. HR variability and pain-related cytokines (MCP-1, IL-1RA, IL-8, TGFβ1, and IL-17) are collected as measures of long-term pain. Caregivers will be asked to what degree they observe pain in their patients and how well they believe they understand their patient’s expressions of emotion and pain. Pre-intervention: HR is measured 8 h/day over 2 weeks to identify potentially painful situations across four settings: physiotherapy, cast use, lifting, and personal hygiene. Intervention: Changes in procedures for identified painful situations are in the form of changes in 1) physiotherapy techniques, 2) preparations for putting on casts, 3) lifting techniques or 4) personal hygiene procedures. Design: Nineteen patients will start intervention in week 3 while 19 patients will continue data collection for another 2 weeks before procedure changes are introduced. This is done to distinguish between specific effects of changes in procedures and non-specific effects, such as caregivers increased attention. Discussion: This study will advance the field of wearable physiological sensor use in patient care. Trial registration: Registered prospectively at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05738278).

N2  - Background: Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare genetic disease that is characterized by cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, neutropenia, and growth abnormalities and often leads to death in childhood. Recently, elamipretide has been tested as a potential first disease-modifying drug. This study aimed to identify patients with BTHS who may respond to elamipretide, based on continuous physiological measurements acquired through wearable devices. Results: Data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of 12 patients with BTHS were used, including physiological time series data measured using a wearable device (heart rate, respiratory rate, activity, and posture) and functional scores. The latter included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) fatigue score, SWAY Balance Mobile Application score (SWAY balance score), BTHS Symptom Assessment (BTHS-SA) Total Fatigue score, muscle strength by handheld dynamometry, 5 times sit-and-stand test (5XSST), and monolysocardiolipin to cardiolipin ratio (MLCL:CL). Groups were created through median split of the functional scores into “highest score” and “lowest score”, and “best response to elamipretide” and “worst response to elamipretide”. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) models were implemented to assess whether physiological data could classify patients according to functional status and distinguish non-responders from responders to elamipretide. AHC models clustered patients according to their functional status with accuracies of 60–93%, with the greatest accuracies for 6MWT (93%), PROMIS (87%), and SWAY balance score (80%). Another set of AHC models clustered patients with respect to their response to treatment with elamipretide with perfect accuracy (all 100%). Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated that continuously acquired physiological measurements from wearable devices can be used to predict functional status and response to treatment among patients with BTHS.

N2  - Introduction Obese men with prostate cancer have an increased risk of biochemical recurrence, metastatic disease and mortality. For those undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), substantial increases in fat mass are observed in the first year of treatment. Recently, we showed that a targeted supervised clinic-based exercise and nutrition intervention can result in a substantial reduction in fat mass with muscle mass preserved in ADT-treated patients. However, the intervention needs to be accessible to all patients and not just those who can access a supervised clinic-based programme. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth delivered compared with supervised clinic-based delivered exercise and nutrition intervention in overweight/obese patients with prostate cancer. Methods and analysis A single-blinded, two-arm parallel group, non-inferiority randomised trial will be undertaken with 104 overweight/obese men with prostate cancer (body fat percentage ≥25%) randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to a telehealth-delivered, virtually supervised exercise and nutrition programme or a clinic-based, face-to-face supervised exercise and nutrition programme. Exercise will consist of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed three times a week plus additional self-directed aerobic exercise performed 4 days/week for the first 6 months. Thereafter, for months 7-12, the programmes will be self-managed. The primary endpoint will be fat mass. Secondary endpoints include lean mass and abdominal aortic calcification, anthropometric measures and blood pressure assessment, objective measures of physical function and physical activity levels, patient-reported outcomes and blood markers. Measurements will be undertaken at baseline, 6 months (post intervention), and at 12 months of follow-up. Data will be analysed using intention-to-treat and per protocol approaches. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained from the Edith Cowan University Human Research Ethics Committee (ID: 2021-02157-GALVAO). Outcomes from the study will be published in academic journals and presented in scientific and consumer meetings. Trial registration number ACTRN12621001312831.

N2  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with an increased risk of complications for patients with AF. The impact of diabetes on post-operative AF after cardiac surgery is not well-defined. Purpose: We sought to characterize the effect of diabetes, insulin, and oral hypoglycemic agents on the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery. Accordingly, we conducted a secondary analysis of the Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH-AF) CardioLink-1 randomized trial. Methods: In the SEARCH-AF trial, 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched-based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. We assessed the association between diabetes and occurrence of post-operative AF. In addition, we examined the association between POAF and glucose-lowering therapy among patients with diabetes. Results: Among the 176 (52%) patients with diabetes in the study cohort, 80 (45%) patients were treated with at least 1 oral hypoglycemic agent and 44 (25%) patients were treated with insulin. The incidence of POAF occurring within 30 days after discharge from surgery was similar between patients with or without diabetes (cumulative incidence: 10.8% vs. 10.0%, log-rank p=0.77). Among patients with diabetes, the incidence of POAF was highest in those who were not treated with glucose-lowering therapy (17.3%) when compared with those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (10.0%) or insulin (4.5%) (log-rank ptrend=0.045 among the 3 groups). In an exploratory analysis, we observed a trend suggesting a lower incidence of POAF among cardiac surgical patients who were treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors (log-rank ptrend=0.084). Conclusion: The incidence of POAF occurring after discharge from cardiac surgery is equally high among patients with or without diabetes. Our results suggest a potential association between specific glucose-lowering therapies and risk of POAF after cardiac surgery, meriting further investigations.

N2  - Background: Patients undergoing valve surgery have a higher risk of developing post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) relative to those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Whether this risk extends beyond hospital discharge is unknown. Purpose: We examined the association between surgery type (isolated CABG vs. valve repair/replacement) on the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) by conducting a secondary analysis of the Post- Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH-AF) CardioLink-1 randomized trial. Methods: In the SEARCH-AF trial, 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched-based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12-lead ECG within 30 days of randomization. We compared the risk of POAF between patients who underwent CABG vs. valve repair/replacement. Patients who experienced postoperative AF during hospitalization were excluded from this analysis. Results: The overall cohort consisted of 255, 39, and 42 patients who underwent isolated CABG, isolated valve replacement/repair, and CABG + valve repair/replacement, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar among the groups except for younger age (p=0.0014), higher prevalence of preoperative myocardial infarction (p=0.002) and lower ejection fraction (p=0.025) in the isolated CABG group. Eighteen patients experienced post-operative AF during hospitalization. Patients who underwent CABG + valve surgery or isolated valve surgery were more likely to experience post-operative AF compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (Log-Rank ptrend=0.0096). Among patients who were randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring, the probability of post-operative AF among patients who underwent isolated CABG, valve surgery, and CABG + valve surgery was 15.8%, 29.4%, and 35.0%, respectively (Log- Rank ptrend=0.017). After multivariable adjustment, the risk of developing post-operative AF within 30 days after discharge remained higher among patients who underwent valve surgery compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (hazard ratio (HR) 2.22, 95% CI 1.01-4.87. Patients who underwent CABG + repair/replacement had the highest risk of experiencing post-operative AF when compared to patients who underwent isolated CABG (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.12-6.86). Conclusion: Patients undergoing valve repair or bioprosthetic valve replacement have a substantial risk of post-operative AF within 30 days after discharge from surgery. An aggressive cardiac rhythm monitoring strategy during this vulnerable period should be considered for this high-risk patient population. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Background: There is a surging development of digital technologies for screening and diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF), nonetheless, how these digital technologies impact AF care remains unclear. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate the impact on AF episodes and arrhythmia burden of patient-centered self-management with using smart technologies, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI), wearable and mobile health (mHealth) technology for patient-centred selfmanagement. Methods: In this cohort study, we applied AI machine-learning (ML) model predicting AF prior to 4 hours of AF occurrence, while the timely monitoring of AF episodes with photoplethysmography (PPG) technology, and further confirmation of the diagnosis of AF with single-lead ECG, was based on wearable devices. These have been developed in AF screening study (stage 1 pre-mAFA) of Mobile Health technology for improved screening and optimizing integrated care in atrial fibrillation (mAFA II programme), while mHealth supported integrated care of AF was validated to reduce clinical events (stage 2 mAFA II cluster randomized trial). In this observational cohort, the subjects were in 2 groups: (i) subjects with monitored AF but without using mAFA (Group 1); (ii) subjects with monitored AF and using smart devices and mAFA for patient-centered selfmanagement (Group 2). Adult subjects freely downloaded the mAFA AF App, with compatible devices, and were included into the study from across China between October 26, 2018 and Dec 1, 2021. Results: From 3499461 subjects involving in AF population screening, there were 5904 subjects in Group 1 (mean age 57 years, SD,15 years; 80.7%, male), while 2667 subjects in Group 2 (51, 15; 89.7% male). The diagnosis of AF episodes was confirmed by single-lead ECG recordings, and decreased among those using mAFA in Group 2 (Confirmed AF: 602 in 1st quarter, 224 in 2nd quarter, 81 in 3rd quarter, 52 in 4th quarter) (all p value for trend<0.001). AF burden was significantly reduced over time (PPG: 26% on 1st month, 19% on 12th month; ECG: 3%, 0.7%, all p<0.001), while the average probability of AF occurrences by AI ML model prediction was decreased among those using mAFA in Group 2 (65%, 57%, p<0.001). The decreasing trend of AF burden over time was not seen in subjects with detected AF without mAFA (Group 1). On multivariate analysis, AI ML model driven mAFA-based upstream risk factor control significantly reduced the changes in AF burden of both - 6 month (adjusted OR, 95% CI, 0.51,0.43-0.59) and - 12 month (0.39,0.32- 0.47, all p<0.001). Conclusion: MHealth-AF care increased the adherence of using smart devices for AF detection. The incorporation of smart devices and AI tools into an AF clinical care pathway, effectively reduced AF burden and detected AF episodes, through appropriate rhythm control management and upstream risk factor control.

N2  - Background: There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of statins to reduce the risk of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Purpose:We sought to determine the effects of statin use on the burden of new-onset post-discharge POAF in the Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH-AF) CardioLink-1 randomized controlled trial. Methods: In the SEARCH-AF trial, 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched-based device. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/ flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. Using time-to-event analysis and Cox regression, we evaluated the association between the risk of post-operative AF in relation to statin use and dosing intensity (low, moderate, high) at the time of discharge. We excluded patients who experienced post-operative AF during hospitalization in this analysis. Results: In the overall cohort (n=336), 260 (77.4%) patients were treated with statins at the time of hospital discharge. There were 18 (5.4%) patients who experienced post-operative AF during hospitalization. Patients prescribed with statins were more likely to be male (p=0.018), had lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores (p=0.011), and were more likely to undergo isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (p=0.083). Baseline characteristics were otherwise similar between the 2 groups. Patients treated with statins at discharge had a 2-fold lower rate of post-operative AF than those who were not treated with statins in the overall cohort (17.6% vs. 8.2%, Log-Rank p=0.017) and among those who were randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring (31.6% vs. 16.0%, Log-Rank p=0.027) (Figure). After adjusting for surgery type (CABG vs. valve surgery) and the CHA2DS2-VASc score, statin use at discharge was associated with a lower risk of post-operative AF within 30 days after surgery (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.97). Furthermore, increasing intensity of statin therapy was associated with lower risk of POAF (ptrend=0.0012) (Figure 1) Conclusion: Among cardiac surgery patients with risk factors for stroke and no history of pre-operative AF, the use of statins was associated with a reduction in post-operative AF risk within 30 days of discharge. The routine use of high-intensity statin to prevent post-operative AF after cardiac surgery deserves further study.

N2  - Background: Measuring mobility in daily life entails dealing with confounding factors arising from multiple sources, including pathological characteristics, patient specific walking strategies, environment/context, and purpose of the task. The primary aim of this study is to propose and validate a protocol for simulating real-world gait accounting for all these factors within a single set of observations, while ensuring minimisation of participant burden and safety. Methods: The protocol included eight motor tasks at varying speed, incline/steps, surface, path shape, cognitive demand, and included postures that may abruptly alter the participants’ strategy of walking. It was deployed in a convenience sample of 108 participants recruited from six cohorts that included older healthy adults (HA) and participants with potentially altered mobility due to Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), proximal femoral fracture (PFF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF). A novelty introduced in the protocol was the tiered approach to increase difficulty both within the same task (e.g., by allowing use of aids or armrests) and across tasks. Results: The protocol proved to be safe and feasible (all participants could complete it and no adverse events were recorded) and the addition of the more complex tasks allowed a much greater spread in walking speeds to be achieved compared to standard straight walking trials. Furthermore, it allowed a representation of a variety of daily life relevant mobility aspects and can therefore be used for the validation of monitoring devices used in real life. Conclusions: The protocol allowed for measuring gait in a variety of pathological conditions suggests that it can also be used to detect changes in gait due to, for example, the onset or progression of a disease, or due to therapy.

N2  - Background: LINK-HF study has shown that multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor combined with machine learning can provide accurate early detection of impending heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Whether early intervention based on predictive data generated through artificial intelligence (AI) analytical methods could improve outcomes in HF is not known. Methods: The LINK-HF2 study consists of two phases. The completed, non-randomized vanguard phase enrolled 27 patients with HF at 2 VA sites, and the ongoing main randomized phase will enroll 240 patients at 5 VA sites. The predictive AI system used in this study is a cloud-based analytic platform that generates a multivariate change index (MCI) to identify changes in observed physiological patterns that deviate from the expected normal behavior. Results: In the vanguard phase, comprehensive implementation program was developed and examined integration of non-invasive remote monitoring and subsequent algorithmic response to the clinical workflow. Clinicians responded to notifications within 24 hours in 95% of instances and clinical action was taken in 25% of instances. Challenges included over-alerting, time needed for data review, staffing, and deference to other providers. The results of the vanguard phase were used to make the following protocol adjustments: 1. Refinement of the algorithmic response to predictive alerts (Figure 1); 2. Expansion of clinician education; 3. Improved education of study subjects on the meaning of predictive notifications; and 4. Aggregating repeated MCI alerts within 72 hours into a single event.In the randomized phase of LINK-HF2, 240 subjects with HF will be fitted with the non-invasive monitor and randomized to either an active arm, in which notifications will be communicated to clinical providers and followed by an algorithmic response, or to a control arm where notifications will not be communicated to the clinical team. Study outcomes will be: 1. HF hospitalization, 2. All-cause hospitalization, 3. Hospitalization length, 4. Health-related quality of life (KCCQ-12, VAS), 5. Cost of medical care. Conclusions: The LINK-HF2 study will provide clinical utility data for and approach where algorithmic response will be taken to AI predictive analytics derived from multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor

N2  - Background Long-term adherence to exercise is often poor for people with coronary heart disease (CHD) who have completed supervised, centre-based cardiac rehabilitation. Wearable activity devices with personalised feedback may remotely support people with CHD to maintain their exercise achieved during cardiac rehabilitation (CR). Aim The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of a remotely prescribed, delivered and monitored CR intervention using a wearable device to support long-term adherence to exercise and physical activity during maintenance cardiac rehabilitation. Methods After completing and being discharged from phase III CR , 30 participants with CHD, will be randomised (1:1) to an intervention (n=15) or a usual care group (n=15) in a 12- month feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT). The intervention will comprise of an exercise consultation, personalised exercise prescription delivered via a wearable activity monitor using biometric feedback, regular monitoring via check-ins at one, three and six-months, and feedback text-messages for sixmonths. Participants will be assessed at baseline (following completion of CR) and at three-, six-, and 12-months postrandomisation. The primary outcome will be feasibility, including assessment of eligibility, recruitment, adherence, and acceptability. Secondary outcomes will include exercise capacity, physical activity behaviours, 10-year risk for recurrent vascular events using the SMART risk score and quality of life. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted at three-, six-, and 12-months post randomisation (and with those who drop-out) to explore the acceptability of the study intervention and procedures. A questionnaire will be offered to those who decline participation. Conclusion The MAINTAIN study will evaluate the feasibility of conducting a future definitive multi-centre RCT testing a remotely prescribed and monitored long-term maintenance exercise programme using a wearable activity device, versus usual care, for people with CHD who have completed supervised CR.

N2  - Background: The impact of using direct-to-consumer wearable devices as a means to timely detect atrial fibrillation (AF) and to improve clinical outcomes is unknown. Methods: Heartline is a pragmatic, randomized, and decentralized application-based trial of US participants aged ≥65 years. Two randomized cohorts include adults with possession of an iPhone and without a history of AF and those with a diagnosis of AF taking a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for ≥30 days. Participants within each cohort are randomized (3:1) to either a core digital engagement program (CDEP) via iPhone application (Heartline application) and an Apple Watch (Apple Watch Group) or CDEP alone (iPhone-only Group). The Apple Watch Group has the watch irregular rhythm notification (IRN) feature enabled and access to the ECG application on the Apple Watch. If an IRN notification is issued for suspected AF then the study application instructs participants in the Apple Watch Group to seek medical care. All participants were “watch-naïve” at time of enrollment and have an option to either buy or loan an Apple Watch as part of this study. The primary end point is time from randomization to clinical diagnosis of AF, with confirmation by health care claims. Key secondary endpoint are claims-based incidence of a 6-component composite cardiovascular/systemic embolism/mortality event, DOAC medication use and adherence, costs/health resource utilization, and frequency of hospitalizations for bleeding. All study assessments, including patient-reported outcomes, are conducted through the study application. The target study enrollment is approximately 28,000 participants in total; at time of manuscript submission, a total of 26,485 participants have been enrolled into the study. Conclusion: The Heartline Study will assess if an Apple Watch with the IRN and ECG application, along with application-facilitated digital health engagement modules, improves time to AF diagnosis and cardiovascular outcomes in a real-world environment. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04276441.

Methods: Patients with AF who were scheduled for electrical cardioversion (ECV) were included in this study. The AW ECGs were obtained pre-ECV and post-ECV. In case of an unclassified recording, the AW ECG was obtained up to 3 times. The 12-lead ECG was used as the reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and kappa coefficient were calculated. Results: In total, 74 patients were included. Mean age was 67.1 ± 12.3 years and 20.3% were female. In total 65 AF and 64 sinus rhythm measurements were obtained. The first measurement with the AW showed a sensitivity of 93.5% and specificity of 100% (κ = 0.94). A second measurement resulted in a sensitivity of 94.6% and specificity of 100% (κ = 0.95). A third measurement resulted in a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 96.5% (κ = 0.90). Adjudication of unclassified recordings by a physician reduced the total unclassified recordings from 27.9% to 1.6%, but also reduced the accuracy. The kappa coefficient for unclassified single-lead ECGs was 0.58. Conclusion: The single-lead ECG of the AW shows a high accuracy for identifying AF in a clinical setting. Repeating the recording once decreases the total of unclassified recordings; however, a third recording resulted in a lower accuracy and the occurrence of false-positive measurements. Unclassified results of the AW can be reduced by physicians’ interpretation of the single-lead ECG; however, the interrater agreement is only moderate.

N2  - Introduction: Few late-stage clinical trials in Parkinson's disease (PD) have produced evidence on the clinical validity of sensor-based digital measurements of daily life activities to detect responses to treatment. The objective of this study was to assess whether digital measures from patients with mild-to-moderate Lewy Body Dementia demonstrate treatment effects during a randomized Phase 2 trial. Methods: Substudy within a 12-week trial of mevidalen (placebo vs 10, 30, or 75 mg), where 70/344 patients (comparable to the overall population) wore a wrist-worn multi-sensor device. Results: Treatment effects were statistically significant by conventional clinical assessments (Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale [MDS-UPDRS] sum of Parts I-III and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change [ADCS-CGIC] scores) in the full study cohort at Week 12, but not in the substudy. However, digital measurements detected significant effects in the substudy cohort at week 6, persisting to week 12. Conclusions: Digital measurements detected treatment effects in a smaller cohort over a shorter period than conventional clinical assessments. Trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03305809

N2  - Chronic pain impacts one in five Americans and is difficult to manage, costing ~USD 600 billion annually. The subjective experience of pain is a complex processing of central nervous system input. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging revealed the prefrontal cortex as vital to the perception of pain and that changes in the cerebral hemodynamics can be used to detect painful sensations. Current pain monitoring is dependent on the subjective rating provided by patients and is limited to a single time point. We have developed a biomarker for the objective, real-time and continuous chronic pain assessment using proprietary algorithms termed ROPA and cerebral optical spectrometry. Using a forehead sensor, the cerebral optical spectrometry data were collected in two clinical sites from 41 patients (19 and 22, respectively, from sites 1 and 2), who elected to receive an epidural steroid injection for the treatment of chronic pain. Patients rated their pain on a numeric rating scale, ranging from 0–10, which were used to validate the ROPA objective pain scoring. Multiple time points, including pre- and post-procedure were recorded. The steroid injection was performed per standard medical practice. There was a significant correlation between the patient’s reported numeric rating scale and ROPA, for both clinical sites (Overall ~0.81). Holding the subjective pain ratings on a numeric rating scale as ground truth, we determined that the area under the receiver operator curves for both sites revealed at least good (AUC: 64%) to excellent (AUC > 98%) distinctions between clinically meaningful pain severity differentiations (no/mild/moderate/severe). The objective measure of chronic pain (ROPA) determined using cerebral optical spectrometry significantly correlated with the subjective pain scores reported by the subjects. This technology may provide a useful method of detection for the objective and continuous monitoring and treatment of patients with chronic pain, particularly in clinical circumstances where direct assessment is not available, or to complement the patient-reported pain scores.

N2  - Background: Whether statins reliably reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains controversial. We sought to determine the impact of statin use on new-onset postdischarge POAF in the Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH-AF) CardioLink-1 randomized controlled trial. Methods: We randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2) and no history of preoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) to 30-day continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched-based device or to usual care. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cumulative AF and/or atrial flutter lasting for ≥ 6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring, or AF and/or atrial flutter documented by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. Results: The 260 patients (77.4%) discharged on statins were more likely to be male (P = 0.018) and to have lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores (P = 0.011). Patients treated with statins at discharge had a 2-fold lower rate of POAF than those who were not treated with statins in the entire cohort (18.4% vs 8.1%, log-rank P = 0.0076). On multivariable Cox regression including the CHA2DS2-VASc score adjustment, statin use was associated with a lower risk of POAF (hazard ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.25-0.98, P = 0.043). Use of statins at a higher intensity was associated with lower risk of POAF, suggestive of a dose–response effect (log-rank Ptrend = 0.0082). Conclusions: The use of statins was associated with a reduction in postdischarge POAF risk among patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The routine use of high-intensity statin to prevent subacute POAF after discharge deserves further study.

N2  - Background: Women with breast cancer account for the largest cohort (23%) of over 18 million cancer survivors in the United States. Of the nearly 4 million breast cancer survivors, many, including individuals with metastatic breast cancer, will require lifelong treatment for chronic conditions. As part of a multi-site study including diverse tumor types, breast cancer survivors are being recruited to explore the feasibility and outcomes of a digital health coaching (DHC) program following the completion of primary therapy to support self-management of symptoms and general wellness. Trial design: A randomized-wait list control design will evaluate outcomes related to engagement in a DHC program following completion of primary therapy. Participants will be enrolled in a 6-month DHC program delivering evidence-based content via weekly calls, text, and email, in addition to usual support from their respective healthcare teams. The intervention group will receive coaching upon enrollment. The control group will receive coaching after a 6-month monitoring period. Twelve months of longitudinal clinical, patient-reported outcomes, activity tracking (via Fitbit), and microbiome data will be collected from both groups. Eligibility criteria: The breast cancer cohort will consist of individuals with both localized and metastatic disease within 1 year of completion of primary therapy, defined as treatment of curative intent, first-line or later, from which the individual is advancing to active surveillance or follow-up, with or without maintenance therapy. All study participants must be >18 years old, able to read and speak English, have access to mobile technology, and agree to wear and have data collected from an activity tracker. Specific aims: 1) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a DHC program and its effect on participant health selfefficacy; 2) characterize associations between participant symptoms, physical/psychosocial wellbeing, and health self-management and gut microbiota changes; and 3) explore patient-generated health data outcomes among participants (patient reported and wearable biometrics outcomes). Statistical methods: Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed through descriptive statistics. Feasibility for this study is defined as a retention rate ≥70%, and acceptability is defined as ≤20% scoring “not at all helpful.” Secondary aims will be assessed using linear mixed models. Crosscohort analysis of physical function, measured by the PROMiS Physical Function 10a, will be conducted. Assuming a power of 0.8 and significance level of .05, we will be able to detect a 2.51 difference in PROMiS score means between the control and intervention group (SD 10) with a sample of 500 total participants. Sub-group analysis will be conducted with the anticipated 250 participants in the breast cancer cohort with a focus on feasibility, acceptability, and descriptive and exploratory endpoints for this population as a whole and comparing early stage and metastatic participants. Target and present accruals: 500 individuals with diverse tumor types will be enrolled across 5 collaborating sites, of which 4 ill include individuals with breast cancer. An estimated 250 breast cancer participants (approximately 50% of the total study population), including 150 with de novo or progressive metastatic breast cancer, are planned to be recruited. To date, 1 Midwestern site has enrolled the first 7 breast cancer survivors. Two additional sites plan to enroll in July 2022, with the remaining 2 sites to begin enrollment by the end of 2022.

N2  - Frailty in patients after open-heart surgery influences the type and intensity of a cardiac rehabilitation program. The response to tailored exercise training can be different, requiring convenient tools to assess the effectiveness of a training program routinely. The study aims to investigate whether kinematic measures extracted from the acceleration signals can provide information about frailty trajectories during rehabilitation. One hundred patients after open-heart surgery, assigned to the equal-sized intervention and control groups, participated in exercise training during inpatient rehabilitation. After rehabilitation, the intervention group continued exercise training at home, whereas the control group was asked to maintain the usual physical activity regimen. Stride time, cadence, movement vigor, gait asymmetry, Lissajous index, and postural sway were estimated during the clinical walk and stair-climbing tests before and after inpatient rehabilitation as well as after home-based exercise training. Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton frail scale. Most kinematic measures estimated during walking improved after rehabilitation along with the improvement in frailty status, i.e., stride time, cadence, postural sway, and movement vigor improved in 71%, 77%, 81%, and 83% of patients, respectively. Meanwhile, kinematic measures during stair-climbing improved to a lesser extent compared to walking. Home-based exercise training did not result in a notable change in kinematic measures which agrees well with only a negligible deterioration in frailty status. The study demonstrates the feasibility to follow frailty trajectories during inpatient rehabilitation after open-heart surgery based on kinematic measures extracted using a single wearable sensor.

N2  - The urban overheating phenomenon in Mediterranean cities is a societal challenge with vast implications for the protection of public health. An additional analysis of the pilot TEMP randomized 2 × 2 cross-over trial was set up, using wearable sensor-based skin temperature measurements (n = 14). The study objectives were to: (i) assess the recurrence patterns of skin temperature measurements in individuals spending time in two climatologically contrasting settings (urban versus mountainous), and (ii) evaluate the association between the diurnal nonlinear recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) metrics and metabolic hormone levels. The intervention was a short-term stay (5–7 days) in a mountainous, climate-cooler setting (range 600–900 m altitude), which is about a 1 h drive from the main urban centres of Cyprus. The RQA analysis showed a blunting phenomenon on the nonlinear temporal dynamics of skin temperature time series observed in the urban setting. Compared with the mountainous setting, a more stable (and thus less adaptive) profile of skin temperature dynamics in the urban setting appeared, being less deterministic and with a smaller degree of complexity. No significant (p > 0.05) associations were observed between the leptin or cortisol and any of the skin temperature dynamical descriptors. However, there were marginal associations between the adiponectin and laminarity (beta = 0.24, 95%CI: −0.02, 0.50, p = 0.07) and with determinism (beta = 0.23, 95%CI: −0.037, 0.50, p = 0.09). We found dysregulations in skin temperature temporal dynamics of the study population while residing in the urban setting when compared with the cooler mountainous setting; these dysregulations took the form of reduced cycle duration and complexity, while skin temperature dynamics became less responsive to perturbations and less regular in magnitude. More research is needed to better understand heat stress temporal dynamics and their influence on human health. Trial registration: This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov; number: NCT03625817.

N2  - Background: The Ambient Intelligent Geriatric Management (AmbIGeM) system combines wearable sensors with artificial intelligence to trigger alerts to hospital staff before a fall. A clinical trial found no effect across a heterogenous population, but reported a reduction in the injurious falls rate in a post hoc analysis of patients on Geriatric Evaluation Management Unit (GEMU) wards. Cost-effectiveness and Value of Information (VoI) analyses of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards was undertaken. Methods: An Australian health-care system perspective and 5-year time horizon were used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Implementation costs, inpatient costs and falls data were collected. Injurious falls were defined as causing bruising, laceration, fracture, loss of consciousness, or if the patient reported persistent pain. To compare costs and outcomes, generalised linear regression models were used to adjust for baseline differences between the intervention and usual care groups. Bootstrapping was used to represent uncertainty. For the VoI analysis, 10,000 different sample sizes with randomly sampled values ranging from 1 to 50,000 were tested to estimate the optimal sample size of a new trial that maximised the Expected Net Benefits of Sampling. Results: An adjusted 0.036 fewer injurious falls (adjusted rate ratio of 0.56) and AUD$4554 lower costs were seen in the intervention group. However, uncertainty that the intervention is cost effective for the prevention of an injurious fall was present at all monetary values of this effectiveness outcome. A new trial with a sample of 4376 patients was estimated to maximise the Expected Net Benefit of Sampling, generating a net benefit of AUD$186,632 at a benefit-to-cost ratio of 1.1. Conclusions: The benefits to cost ratio suggests that a new trial of the AmbIGeM system in GEMU wards may not be high-value compared to other potential trials, and that the system should be implemented. However, a broader analysis of options for preventing falls in GEMU is required to fully inform decision making.

N2  - (1) Background: We present the protocol of a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the benefit of a novel clinical decision support system for the management of patients with COVID-19. (2) Methods: The study will recruit up to 500 participants (250 cases and 250 controls). Both groups will receive the conventional telephone follow-up protocol by primary care and will also be provided with access to a mobile application, in which they will be able to report their symptoms three times a day. In addition, patients in the active group will receive a wearable smartwatch and a pulse oximeter at home for real-time monitoring. The measured data will be visualized by primary care and emergency health service professionals, allowing them to detect in real time the progression and complications of the disease in order to promote early therapeutic interventions based on their clinical judgement. (3) Results: Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Drug Research Ethics Committee of the Valladolid East Health Area (CASVE-NM-21-516). The results obtained from this study will form part of the thesis of two PhD students and will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal. (4) Conclusions: The implementation of this telemonitoring system can be extrapolated to patients with other similar diseases, such as chronic diseases, with a high prevalence and need for close monitoring.

N2  - In order to solve the shortcomings of the current clinical scale assessment for stroke patients, such as excessive time consumption, strong subjectivity, and coarse grading, this study designed an intelligent rehabilitation assessment system based on wearable devices and a machine learning algorithm and explored the effectiveness of the system in assessing patients’ rehabilitation outcomes. The accuracy and effectiveness of the intelligent rehabilitation assessment system were verified by comparing the consistency and time between the designed intelligent rehabilitation assessment system scores and the clinical Fugl–Meyer assessment (FMA) scores. A total of 120 stroke patients from two hospitals participated as volunteers in the trial study, and statistical analyses of the two assessment methods were performed. The results showed that the R2 of the total score regression analysis for both methods was 0.9667, 95% CI 0.92–0.98, p < 0.001, and the mean of the deviation was 0.30, 95% CI 0.57–1.17. The percentages of deviations/relative deviations falling within the mean ± 1.96 SD of deviations/relative deviations were 92.50% and 95.83%, respectively. The mean time for system assessment was 35.00% less than that for clinician assessment, p < 0.05. Therefore, wearable intelligent machine learning rehabilitation assessment has a strong and significant correlation with clinician assessment, and the time spent is significantly reduced, which provides an accurate, objective, and effective solution for clinical rehabilitation assessment and remote rehabilitation without the presence of physicians.

N2  - Background Melanoma survivors are at increased risk of developing a second primary melanoma; however, some report sub-optimal sun behaviors and sunburns. We tested the effectiveness of a wearable device with ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-sensing technology to improve sun behaviors and reduce sunburns in cutaneous melanoma survivors. Materials and methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial using Shade 2, a commercially available wrist device that measures UVR. The intervention group received the device and mobile application notifications about their exposure and prompts to use sunscreen. The control group received the device and a separate research mobile application without information about their exposure or notifications. Participants wore the device for 12 weeks and self-reported sun behaviors before, during, and after the intervention. The primary outcome was a composite score of sun protection behaviors at week 12. Results 386 participants were randomized (186 control, 182 intervention). Most were female and 5+ years past their first melanoma diagnosis. The average age was 56 years. Most (93%) completed the study, though 40% experienced device issues. No meaningful differences were observed in self-reported sun protection behaviors at week 12 (controls 3.0±0.5 vs. intervention 2.9±0.5, p = 0.06), any sunburn during the intervention period (controls 14.4% vs. intervention 12.7%, p = 0.75), or average daily objective UVR exposure (controls median 87 vs. intervention 83 J/m2, p = 0.43). Conclusion Wearing a device that measured and alerted melanoma survivors to UVR exposure did not result in different sun behaviors, exposure, or sunburns relative to controls. The technology needs refinement before further attempts to assess the effectiveness of self-monitoring UVR exposure.

N2  - Introduction: Physical inactivity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and other modifiable lifestyle-related factors are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF), ectopics, and other arrhythmias. The increasing use of wearables can monitor changes in these risk factors. We aimed to develop a machine learning (ML)-based model for real-time prediction of cardiac arrhythmia risk using wearables via the tracking of unhealthy lifestyle risk factors. Methods: In this prospective study, we applied Linear Regression (LR), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to develop ML approaches to predict the cardiac arrhythmia risks by tracking lifestyle behaviors change between August 1, 2020, to August 1, 2021, across China. The dataset of 2676 subjects (mean age ± SD, 46 ± 16 years, 75% male) was randomly divided (7:3) into a training cohort and a testing cohort, with a total of 13,230 signals available for the optimization of the model. We validated the model in an independent cohort of 1973 subjects. Furthermore, we assessed the consistency of subject-reported outcomes and cardiac arrhythmias risk predicted by ML models involving 470 subjects. Application: The 28 features of sleep quality, 16 features of physical activity, 12 features of OSA, and 18 features of prior monitored cardiac arrhythmia, were available for developing the model. For the testing cohort, the accuracy (%, standard deviation, SD) of ML approaches for cardiac arrhythmia risk were 86 9% ± 0 8 with LR, 89 8% ± 0 6 with LGBM, and 88 2% ± 0 8 with SMOTE + LGBM, while F1-scores (SD) were 70 8 ± 1 4, 73 9 ± 1 3, and 73 1 ± 1 6, respectively. The goodness-of-fit of sleep quality, physical activity, OSA, and others (stress, etc.) of the ML models to the real-world setting, in relation to risk strata of cardiac arrhythmia, ranged from 0 95-0 99. The area under the curve (AUCs, 95% confidence interval, CI) of LR and LGBM for high-risk cardiac arrhythmia were 0.97 (0.85-0.98) and 0.96 (0.095-0.98), respectively (DeLong test, p = 0.334). For the externally validated cohort, the accuracy and F1-score of the ML approach for cardiac arrhythmia risk were 90 8% and 75 5% with LGBM, respectively, while 88.5% and 75.1% with LR, respectively. A comprehensive score of the subject-reported outcome questionnaire was 82.9, which was highly consistent with the cardiac arrhythmias predicted by ML models. Future A wearable-based ML approaches demonstrated good ability for predicting cardiac arrhythmia risk. ML models offer a solution to operationalize the proactive management of lifestyle behaviors and risk factors modification in the general population to reduce the burden of AF and other common arrhythmias.

N2  - Background Active ageing is described as the process of optimizing health, empowerment, and security to enhance the quality of life in the rapidly growing population of older adults. Meanwhile, multimorbidity and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), lead to global public health and resource limitations. We introduce a novel user-centered paradigm of ageing based on wearable-driven artificial intelligence (AI) that may harness the autonomy and independence that accompany functional limitation or disability, and possibly elevate life expectancy in older adults and people with PD. Methods ActiveAgeing is a 4-year, multicentre, mixed method, cyclic study that combines digital phenotyping via commercial devices (Empatica E4, Fitbit Sense, and Oura Ring) with traditional evaluation (clinical assessment scales, in-depth interviews, and clinical consultations) and includes four types of participants: (1) people with PD and (2) their informal caregiver; (3) healthy older adults from the Helgetun living environment in Norway, and (4) people on the Helgetun waiting list. For the first study, each group will be represented by N = 15 participants to test the data acquisition and to determine the sample size for the second study. To suggest lifestyle changes, modules for human expert-based advice, machine-generated advice, and self-generated advice from accessible data visualization will be designed. Quantitative analysis of physiological data will rely on digital signal processing (DSP) and AI techniques. The clinical assessment scales are the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and the REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ). A qualitative inquiry will be carried out with individual and focus group interviews and analysed using a hermeneutic approach including narrative and thematic analysis techniques. Discussion We hypothesise that digital phenotyping is feasible to explore the ageing process from clinical and lifestyle perspectives including older adults and people with PD. Data is used for clinical decision-making by symptom tracking, predicting symptom evolution, and discovering new outcome measures for clinical trials.

N2  - Study Design: Multicentric retrospective study, Level of evidence III. Objective: The objective of this multicentric study was to analyze the prevalence and risk factors of early postoperative complications in adult spinal deformity patients treated with fusion. Additionally, we studied the impact of complications on unplanned readmission and hospital length of stay. Methods: Eight spine centers from 6 countries in Latin America were involved in this study. Patients with adult spinal deformity treated with fusion surgery from 2017 to 2019 were included. Baseline and surgical characteristics such as age, sex, comorbidities, smoking, number of levels fused, number of surgical approaches were analyzed. Postoperative complications at 30 days were recorded according to Clavien-Dindo and Glassman classifications. Results: 172 patients (120 females/52 males, mean age 59.4 ± 17.6) were included in our study. 78 patients suffered complications (45%) at 30 days, 43% of these complications were considered major. Unplanned readmission was observed in 35 patients (20,3%). Risk factors for complications were: Smoking, previous comorbidities, number of levels fused, two or more surgical approaches and excessive bleeding. Hospital length of stay in patients without and with complications was of 7.8 ± 13.7 and 17 ± 31.1 days, respectively (P 0.0001). Conclusion: The prevalence of early postoperative complications in adult spinal deformity patients treated with fusion was of 45% in our study with 20% of unplanned readmissions at 30 days. Presence of complications significantly increased hospital length of stay.

N2  - We aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of 90-day cardiac monitoring with an external Holter device and to find a target population able to benefit from such a technique. Cryptogenic stroke patients were continuously monitored for 90 days with a textile wearable Holter (TWH). Compliance and quality of the monitoring were assessed by the number of hours of ECG stored per month. Mean predictors of pAF, including age, gender, stroke severity, and atrial size (LAVI), were evaluated. One-year follow-up assessed pAF detection outside per protocol monitoring. Out of 224 patients included in 5 stroke centers, 163 patients (72.76%) fulfilled the criteria for the protocol. Median monitoring time was similar among the three months. Per protocol pAF detection reached 35.37% at 90 days. The age (OR 1.095; 95% CI 1.03–1.14) and the LAVI (OR 1.055; 95% CI 1.01–1.09) independently predicted pAF. The cut-off point of 70 years (AUC 0.68) (95% CI 0.60–0.76) predicted pAF with a sensitivity of 75.8% and specificity of 50.5%. The LAVI cut-off point of 28.5 (AUC 0.67) (95% CI 0.56–0.77) had a sensitivity of 63.6% and a specificity of 61.8% to detect pAF. The combination of both markers enhanced the validity of pAF detection sensitivity to 89.6%, with a specificity of 27.59%. These patients had increased risk of pAF during the 90-day monitoring HR 3.23 (χ2 7.15) and beyond 90 days (χ2 5.37). Intensive 90-days TWH monitoring detected a high percentage of pAF. However, a significant number of patients did not complete the monitoring. Patients older than 70 years and with enlarged left atria benefitted more from the protocol.

N2  - Background: Fertility awareness and menses prediction are important for improving fecundability and health management. Previous studies have used physiological parameters, such as basal body temperature (BBT) and heart rate (HR), to predict the fertile window and menses. However, their accuracy is far from satisfactory. Additionally, few researchers have examined irregular menstruators. Thus, we aimed to develop fertile window and menstruation prediction algorithms for both regular and irregular menstruators. Methods: This was a prospective observational cohort study conducted at the International Peace Maternity and Child Health Hospital in Shanghai, China. Participants were recruited from August 2020 to November 2020 and followed up for at least four menstrual cycles. Participants used an ear thermometer to assess BBT and wore the Huawei Band 5 to record HR. Ovarian ultrasound and serum hormone levels were used to determine the ovulation day. Menstruation was self-reported by women. We used linear mixed models to assess changes in physiological parameters and developed probability function estimation models to predict the fertile window and menses with machine learning. Results: We included data from 305 and 77 qualified cycles with confirmed ovulations from 89 regular menstruators and 25 irregular menstruators, respectively. For regular menstruators, BBT and HR were significantly higher during fertile phase than follicular phase and peaked in the luteal phase (all P < 0.001). The physiological parameters of irregular menstruators followed a similar trend. Based on BBT and HR, we developed algorithms that predicted the fertile window with an accuracy of 87.46%, sensitivity of 69.30%, specificity of 92.00%, and AUC of 0.8993 and menses with an accuracy of 89.60%, sensitivity of 70.70%, and specificity of 94.30%, and AUC of 0.7849 among regular menstruators. For irregular menstruators, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 72.51%, 21.00%, 82.90%, and 0.5808 respectively, for fertile window prediction and 75.90%, 36.30%, 84.40%, and 0.6759 for menses prediction. Conclusions: By combining BBT and HR recorded by the Huawei Band 5, our algorithms achieved relatively ideal performance for predicting the fertile window and menses among regular menstruators. For irregular menstruators, the algorithms showed potential feasibility but still need further investigation. Trial registration: ChiCTR2000036556. Registered 24 August 2020.

N2  - Objectives: Stroke patients in the acute phase are often unstable and their clinical condition can change suddenly. For this reason, vital parameters, such as heart rate, blood pressure and oxyhemoglobin saturation, are continuously monitored in the setting of a Stroke Unit. Patients are also frequently clinically examined, but it is very challenging constantly observe the evolving clinical picture. In this context, an automatic system able to monitor the patient's motor activity, such as actigraphic sensors, could be particularly useful. Specifically, Motor Activity (MA) and Asimmetry Index (AR) are two well-established actigraphic parameters that describe the motor activity of the arms and that have been previously found to correlate with the neurological condition of stroke patients. Materials: We conducted a multicenter prospective observational study enrolling patients with ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery during their stay in a sub-intensive Stroke Unit. NIHSS was performed every hour since admission and motor activity of both arms was continuously recorded using a wearable accelerometer-based actigraphic system positioned on each wrist. Methods: In order to verify whether actigraphic parameters were able to identify clinical conditions of different severity, we calculated themean values of MA and AR in the first hour after admission and in the first hour following a significant clinical change (at least 4 points of NIHSS) or at the end of hospitalization. We identified the best actigraphic parameters to describe NIHSS with a regression model and calculated the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve in order to find a cut-off value to discriminate minor (NIHSS <5) from major stroke (NIHSS ≥5) and NIHSS 5-9 from NIHSS≥10. Results: We recruited a total of 69 patients. We found that the combination of AR and MA of the non-paretic arm is the best model to properly predict NIHSS score, with a sensitivity=89%, specificity=82%, PPV=92% and NPV=75% in discriminating minor (NIHSS<5) from major stroke (NIHSS≥5). We also identified an AR cut-off value able to identify severe stroke patients (NIHSS≥10) with sensitivity=82% specificity= 74% (AUC 0.86 p<0.001) PPV=73% NPP=82%. Discussion: We identified actigraphic parameters able to distinguish minor from major stroke. Actigraphic system can reliably describe the overall severity of stroke patients with motor symptoms. Long-lasting actigraphic monitoring of upper limbs' motor activity could be useful to detect clinical fluctuations in the first days after stroke. Conclusions: These data support the addition of a wearable actigraphic system to the standard multi-parametric monitoring in stroke unit.

N2  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with an increased risk of complications for patients with AF. The impact of diabetes on post-operative AF after cardiac surgery is not well-defined. Methods and Results: We sought to characterize the effect of diabetes, insulin, and oral hypoglycemic agents on the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) after cardiac surgery. We performed a sub-analysis from the Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH-AF) CardioLink-1 randomized trial (NCT02793895). It randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched-based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. We examined the association between: (i) diabetes and risk of POAF and (ii) glucose-lowering therapy among patients with diabetes and risk of POAF. Of the 176 (52%) patients with diabetes in the study cohort, 80 (45%) patients were treated with at least 1 oral hypoglycemic agent and 44 (25%) patients were treated with insulin. The incidence of POAF occurring within 30 days after discharge from surgery was similar between patients with or without diabetes (cumulative incidence: 10.8% vs. 10.0%, log-rank p=0.77). Among patients with diabetes, the incidence of POAF was highest in those who were not treated with glucose-lowering therapy (17.3%), followed by those treated with oral hypoglycemic agents (10.0%) and insulin (4.5%) (log-rank p=0.045 for trend). A trend suggesting a lower incidence of POAF was observed among cardiac surgical patients who were treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors (log-rank p=0.084 for trend). Conclusion: Even among patients with little to no POAF immediately after cardiac surgery, the risk of POAF within 30 days after discharge is high. Among patients with diabetes, oral anticoagulation should be considered as per current guidelines. There are possible associations between specific glucose-lowering therapies and risk of POAF after cardiac surgery, meriting further investigations. [Formula presented]

N2  - Background: Smartwatches are FDA-approved to detect atrial fibrillation (AF). We examined the associations between income level with anxiety, patient activation, and daily wear time in stroke survivors using smartwatches for AF detection. Methods: We analyzed data from the Pulsewatch study, a randomized controlled trial (NCT03761394) that enrolled participants aged ≥50 years with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, a CHA2DS2 VASc risk score ≥ 2, and no contraindication to anticoagulation. Participants in the intervention group wore a cardiac patch monitor in addition to a smartwatch and smartphone for AF detection, whereas participants in the control group wore only the cardiac patch monitor. At baseline, 14 days, and 44 days, participants completed General Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Consumer Health Activation Index, which examined anxiety and patient activation, respectively. Adherence to the Pulsewatch system was measured by watch wear time. A longitudinal linear regression model was used to examine associations between baseline income (earning <$50K/yr. vs.≥$50K/yr.) and changes in anxiety, patient activation, and wear time over the study period. Results: A total of 95 participants were included in this study. Participants earning <$50K/yr. were 54.5% male and 90.9% white, while participants earning ≥$50K/yr. were 59.7% male and 88.7% white. At baseline, history of renal disease (12.1% vs 1.6%, 0.029), statin use (84.9% vs 96.8%, 0.034), depressive symptoms (65.6% vs 35.5%, 0.004), and anxiety symptoms (54.5% vs 18.3%, <0.001), were different between the income groups. The high-income group was associated with reduced anxiety and greater activation (β -2.60, p-value <0.001; β 7.83, p-value 0.005, respectively) but not significantly associated with wear-time (β 0.20, p-value 0.50) among stroke survivors. Conclusion: Stroke survivors with high baseline income had reduced anxiety and greater engagement when randomly assigned to smartwatch use for AF detection. Baseline income may influence stress levels and engagement associated with smartwatch use. Studies are needed to evaluate how the prescription of wearable devices affects mood and activation among older adults from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

N2  - Introduction: Standard diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis (AS) requires clinical imaging by echocardiography or cardiac MRI. The purpose of this study was to test the performance of easy to use, artificial intelligent (AI) driven seismocardiogram (SCG) chest acceleration recordings for point of care screening and identification of AS. Hypothesis: SCG measurements can be used by a low dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to accurately predict presence or absence of aortic valve stenosis (AS) and severity of dysfunction. Methods: This IRB approved study included 45 controls (age 46±17y, 20 F, no known cardiovascular disease) and 30 aortic valve disease (AVD) patients (age 30±20y, 7 F, 21 bicuspid). A wearable SCG device (integrated ECG/accelerometer microelectronics) was placed for 2min chest acceleration recordings on the same day as standard of care echocardiography or cardiac MRI, which was used as ground truth data to classify valve function (normal: AS-, mild AS: AS+, moderate/severe AS: AS++). A deep learning CNN (2x2 kernel, softmax/cross entropy classification) was configured to predict/detect degree of AS from spectrally decomposed SCG measurements. Randomized 50% split of subjects was used for CNN training/testing. Performance detecting AS was evaluated for classification accuracy. Results: AI driven SCG detection of valve function abnormality had high sensitivity/specificity (90%, 67%) with a net area under curve (AUC) 0.86. Correct classification of the degree of AS was achieved in 76% of subjects. Normal (AS-) vs abnormal function (AS+ or AS++) was accurately identified by AI driven SCG for 86% of subjects. Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrates that the combination of easily measured 2 minute SCG with a deep processing pipeline could successfully detect the presence and severity of AS, supporting clinical promise for potential use as a low cost, front line screening tool to identify patients with aortic valve dysfunction.

N2  - Introduction When patients receive patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), no basal infusion is always recommended, as the addition of a basal infusion increases the occurrence of postoperative opioid-induced respiratory depression. However, few studies have investigated whether low basal infusions increase the incidence of postoperative hypoxaemia relative to no basal infusion. We intend to conduct a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that PCIA with a low basal infusion does not increase the occurrence of postoperative hypoxaemia relative to PCIA with no basal infusion. Methods and analysis This single-centre parallel randomised controlled clinical trial will be conducted with 160 patients undergoing gastrointestinal tumour surgery. The assigned nurse will set analgesic pumps (low or no basal infusion PCIA) according to block-based randomisation sequence. Other investigators and all participants will be blinded to intervention allocation. All patients will be monitored continuously with the ep pod, a wireless wearable device, recording of oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and daily ambulation duration for 48 hours postoperatively. Three follow-up evaluations will be conducted to assess the analgesic effect (Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score) and opioid-related side effects (Overall Benefit of Analgesic Score (OBAS)). The primary outcome will be the area under the curve for hypoxaemia (defined as SpO 2 <95%) per hour. The secondary outcomes will be the areas under the curve for hypoxaemia defined as SpO 2 <90% and <85% per hour, hydromorphone consumption, OBASs at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, NRS scores at 4, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, and the ambulation time per hour over 48 hours. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Xijing Hospital Ethics Committee (KY20212163-F-1). Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients or their authorised surrogates. All data will be managed with confidentiality. Findings will be disseminated at international conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number ChiCTR2100054317.

N2  - Background: Among the primary aims of new therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) are the reduction of morbidity and restoration or preservation of quality of life (QoL). Selinexor (SEL) is a first-in class, oral, selective inhibitor of nuclear export which blocks exportin 1 (XPO1), forcing the nuclear retention and reactivation of tumor suppressor proteins, ultimately causing cell death in cancer cells. SEL is approved for the treatment of triple refractory multiple myeloma and relapsed/refractory DLBCL. XPORT-GBM-029 (NCT04421378) is a phase 1 dose finding study followed by an open-label randomized phase 2, 3-arm trial to evaluate SEL in combination with standard therapies for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM (n = 350): Arm A- radiation ± SEL; Arm B- radiation and temozolomide ± SEL; Arm C - lomustine ± SEL at first relapse. We have implemented the use of technology to provide sensitive, reliable, and clinically meaningful digital assessments of the performance status of patients. After discussions with the study team and patient advocacy partners at Endbrain- Cancer, we surveyed GBM patients and their caregivers to better understand the symptoms that most affect their QoL and developed this patient-centric tool. The survey revealed four main objectively measurable domains, cognitive function, lateralization, fatigue, and sleep, which impact patient QoL, and can also be affected by GBM therapies. Method: XPORT-GBM-029 incorporates standard clinical and imaging evaluations of GBM progression. In addition, we have incorporated with novel wearable digital tools that objectively measure motor and cognitive function. The study is conducted at 50 sites globally. Patients wear inertial sensors to measure their activity and sleep and complete a cognitive battery at baseline and before each MRI. Results: Associations between objective digital measures of activity, gait, fatigue, sleep, and cognition will be examined with respect to clinical assessments including physical examinations, mRANO, NANO, KPS and PRO QoL questionnaires. Descriptive summary statistics and plots are employed in exploratory data analysis, and other advanced data mining methods may also be considered. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, the XPORTGBM- 029 trial is the first large, prospective, longitudinal study in GBM patients employing digital technology and may provide useful information regarding the utility of wearable and mobile devices for measuring functional outcomes in clinical trials.

N2  - Background: Although many electrocardiography wearable devices have been released recently for the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), there are few studies reporting prospective data for wearable devices compared to the strategy of the existing guidelines in the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cryptogenic stroke. A tiny single-patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE-AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to standard strategy and non-inferiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to an event-recorder-type device will be investigated. Single-patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event-recorder-type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE-AF will clarify the role of a single-lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

N2  - Background: There is conflicting evidence regarding the use of statins to reduce the risk of post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods and Results: We sought to determine the effects of statin use on the incidence of post-discharge POAF in the Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH-AF) CardioLink-1 randomized controlled trial. This trial randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched-based device. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of cumulative AF/AFL lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. We evaluated the association between the risk of post-operative AF in relation to statin use and dosing intensity (low, moderate, high) at the time of discharge. We excluded patients who experienced post-operative AF during hospitalization in this analysis. In the overall cohort (n=336), 260 (77.4%) patients were treated with statins at the time of hospital discharge. There were 18 (5.4%) patients who experienced post-operative AF during hospitalization. Patients prescribed with statins were more likely to be male (p=0.018), had lower CHA2DS2-VASc scores (p=0.011), and were more likely to undergo isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (p=0.083). Patients treated with statins at discharge had a 2-fold lower rate of POAF than those who were not treated with statins in the overall cohort (17.6% vs. 8.2%, Log-Rank p=0.017) and in those randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring (31.6% vs. 16.0%, Log-Rank p=0.027) (Figure). After adjusting for surgery type (CABG vs. valve surgery) and the CHA2DS2-VASc score, statin use at discharge was associated with a lower risk of post-operative AF within 30 days after surgery (hazard ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.24-0.97). Increased intensity of statin therapy was associated with lower risk of POAF (P=0.0012 for trend). (Figure) Conclusion: High-intensity statin could reduce the risk of POAF among cardiac surgical patients with risk factors for stroke. This merits further study. [Formula presented]

N2  - Background: Patients undergoing valve surgery have a higher risk of developing post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) relative to those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Whether this risk extends beyond hospital discharge is unknown. Methods and Results: We examined the association between surgery type (isolated CABG vs. valve repair or replacement) on the incidence of POAF from a sub-analysis of the Post-Surgical Enhanced Monitoring for Cardiac Arrhythmias and Atrial Fibrillation (SEARCH-AF) CardioLink-1 randomized trial. It randomized 336 patients with risk factors for stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2) and no history of preoperative AF were randomized to usual care or continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring for 30 days after discharge from cardiac surgery with a wearable, patched-based device. The primary outcome was occurrence of cumulative atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) lasting for ≥6 minutes detected by continuous monitoring or AF/AFL documented by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. The trial excluded patients who underwent mechanical valve replacement or left atrial appendage ligation. We compared the risk of POAF between patients who underwent CABG vs. valve repair or replacement. Patients who experienced post-operative AF during hospitalization were excluded from this analysis. The overall cohort consisted of 255, 39, and 42 patients who underwent isolated CABG, isolated valve replacement/repair, and CABG + valve repair/replacement, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar among the groups except for younger age (p=0.0014), higher prevalence of preoperative myocardial infarction (p=0.002) and lower ejection fraction (p=0.025) in the isolated CABG group. Eighteen patients experienced post-operative AF during hospitalization. Among 3 surgery subgroups, patients who underwent CABG + valve surgery or isolated valve surgery were more likely to experience post-operative AF compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (Log-Rank ptrend=0.0096). Among patients who were randomized to continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring, the probability of post-operative AF among patients who underwent isolated CABG, valve surgery, and CABG + valve surgery was 15.8%, 29.4%, and 35.0%, respectively (Log-Rank ptrend=0.017). After multivariable adjustment, the risk of developing post-operative AF within 30 days after discharge remained higher among patients who underwent valve surgery compared with those who underwent isolated CABG (hazard ratio (HR) 2.22, 95% CI 1.01-4.87. Patients who underwent CABG + repair/replacement had the highest risk of experiencing post-operative AF relative to patients who underwent isolated CABG (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.12-6.86). Conclusion: An aggressive cardiac rhythm monitoring strategy for AF detection should be considered for patients who are discharged after valvular surgery in light of their elevated stroke risk.

N2  - Aim: This paper presents the preliminary results from the ongoing REMOTE trial. It aims to explore the opportunities and hurdles of using insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) and photoplethysmography-based mobile health (PPG-based mHealth) using a smartphone or smartwatch to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) in cryptogenic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. Methods and Results: Cryptogenic stroke or TIA patients (n = 39) received an ICM to search for AF and were asked to use a blinded PPG-based mHealth application for 6 months simultaneously. They were randomized to smartphone or smartwatch monitoring. In total, 68,748 1-min recordings were performed using PPG-based mHealth. The number of mHealth recordings decreased significantly over time in both smartphone and smartwatch groups (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). Insufficient signal quality was more frequently observed in smartwatch (43.3%) compared to smartphone recordings (17.8%, p < 0.001). However, when looking at the labeling of the mHealth recordings on a patient level, there was no significant difference in signal quality between both groups. Moreover, the use of a smartwatch resulted in significantly more 12-h periods (91.4%) that were clinically useful compared to smartphone users (84.8%) as they had at least one recording of sufficient signal quality. Simultaneously, continuous data was collected from the ICMs, resulting in approximately 6,660,000 min of data (i.e., almost a 100-fold increase compared to mHealth). The ICM algorithm detected AF and other cardiac arrhythmias in 10 and 19 patients, respectively. However, these were only confirmed after adjudication by the remote monitoring team in 1 (10%) and 5 (26.3%) patients, respectively. The confirmed AF was also detected by PPG-based mHealth. Conclusion: Based on the preliminary observations, our paper illustrates the potential as well as the limitations of PPG-based mHealth and ICMs to detect AF in cryptogenic stroke and TIA patients in four elements: (i) mHealth was able to detect AF in a patient in which AF was confirmed on the ICM; (ii) Even state-of-the-art ICMs yielded many false-positive AF registrations; (iii) Both mHealth and ICM still require physician revision; and (iv) Blinding of the mHealth results impairs compliance and motivation.

N2  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia with a lifetime risk of one in 4. Unfortunately, AF often remains undetected, particularly when it is paroxysmal, for which single time-point evaluation is less effective. Recently, unobtrusive cardiac arrhythmia monitoring devices have become available, providing the opportunity to conduct prolonged electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in a patient-friendly manner. We hypothesize that applying these devices in at risk patients may improve AF detection, particularly when used during repeated episodes. We therefore aim to evaluate the diagnostic yield of yearly screening for atrial fibrillation when using a wearable device for continuous ECG monitoring for 7 days in primary care patients ≥ 65 years deemed at high-risk of AF (CHA2DS2VASc score ≥3 for men or ≥4 for women) compared with usual care over a study period of 3 years. Methods: Primary care based, cluster-randomized controlled trial with 10 general practices randomized to the intervention group and 10 general practices randomized to control group. In each group, we aim to enroll 930 patients, ≥65 years and a CHA2DS2VASc score ≥3 for men or ≥ 4 for women. The intervention consists of continuous ECG monitoring for 7 days at start of the study (t = 0), after one (t = 1) and 2 years (t = 2). The control practices will follow usual diagnostic care procedures. Results: Results are expected in 2025. Conclusions: This study differs from previous randomized controlled trials, as it involves longitudinal screening of a risk-stratified population. In case of a beneficial diagnostic yield, the PATCH-AF study will add to the evidence for AF screening. Trial registration: The PATCH-AF study is registered at The Netherlands Trial Register (NTR number NL9656)

N2  - Background: Consumer smartwatches have gained attention as mobile health (mHealth) tools able to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) using photoplethysmography (PPG) or a short strip of electrocardiogram (ECG). PPG has limited accuracy due to the movement artifacts, whereas ECG cannot be used continuously, is usually displayed as a single-lead signal and is limited in asymptomatic cases. Objective: DoubleCheck-AF is a validation study of a wrist-worn device dedicated to providing both continuous PPG-based rhythm monitoring and instant 6-lead ECG with no wires. We evaluated its ability to differentiate between AF and sinus rhythm (SR) with particular emphasis on the challenge of frequent premature beats. Methods and Results: We performed a prospective, non-randomized study of 344 participants including 121 patients in AF. To challenge the specificity of the device two control groups were selected: 95 patients in stable SR and 128 patients in SR with frequent premature ventricular or atrial contractions (PVCs/PACs). All ECG tracings were labeled by two independent diagnosis-blinded cardiologists as “AF,” “SR” or “Cannot be concluded.” In case of disagreement, a third cardiologist was consulted. A simultaneously recorded ECG of Holter monitor served as a reference. It revealed a high burden of ectopy in the corresponding control group: 6.2 PVCs/PACs per minute, bigeminy/trigeminy episodes in 24.2% (31/128) and runs of ≥3 beats in 9.4% (12/128) of patients. AF detection with PPG-based algorithm, ECG of the wearable and combination of both yielded sensitivity and specificity of 94.2 and 96.9%; 99.2 and 99.1%; 94.2 and 99.6%, respectively. All seven false-positive PPG-based cases were from the frequent PVCs/PACs group compared to none from the stable SR group (P < 0.001). In the majority of these cases (6/7) cardiologists were able to correct the diagnosis to SR with the help of the ECG of the device (P = 0.012). Conclusions: This is the first wearable combining PPG-based AF detection algorithm for screening of AF together with an instant 6-lead ECG with no wires for manual rhythm confirmation. The system maintained high specificity despite a remarkable amount of frequent single or multiple premature contractions.

N2  - Background: Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) play a role in the mechanism of effective immunotherapy treatment. A subset of TILs, active CD8+ T cells, can predict better response to therapy. 89Zr-Dfcrefmirlimab is a radiolabeled CD8-specific minibody that can image CD8+ T cells. Objectives: To estimate CD8+ T-cell levels after immunotherapy (IOT) alone and combination IOT and stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) using 89Zr-Df-crefmirlimab ImmunoPET imaging. (Table Presented) Methods: As part of a multi-institutional IRB approved trial (NCT05013099), 7 patients with mRCC received two 89Zr-Df-crefmirlimab PET scans (1.0 mCi ± 20% at 1.5mg API (active pharmaceutical ingredient) per scan), once within 14 days prior to onset of IOT and once after receiving various combinations of IOT (N =7) and SBRT (N= 2). IOT included nivolumab alone (N =2), ipilimumab and nivolumab (N =3), and cabozantinib and nivolumab (N=2). SBRT was 30-35 Gy in 5 fractions to ≥1 metastatic site. ImmunoPET images were registered and resampled to the most recent timepoint enabling direct comparisons of bound activity and body-weight Standard Uptake Value (SUV) of the 89Zr ImmunoPET tracer pre- and post- treatment. Delineation included all sites of lesions (gross tumor volume (GTVs)) and normal structures including total bone and bone marrow, heart, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. Results: Patients in this study had a median age of 68 (range 54-83); 71% were female (n=5). 19 out of 24 lesions (79%) had increased CD8 + uptake with ImmunoPET mean SUV>1.5 (SUV=4.4 ± 2.9 averaged across 19 GTVs) while five lesions had no significant CD8+ uptake (SUV=0.68 ± 0.35 averaged across 5 GTVs). For GTVs with SUV> 1.5, there was a trend but not statistically significant increase in mean SUV for patients treated with IOT+SBRT (N= 2, GTV=8, mean SUV=6.2 ± 4.2) versus IOT alone (N =5, GTV=11, mean SUV= 3.7 ± 2.5) (P=0.12). In IOT+SBRT patients, mean SUV increase was 1.4-fold (range 0.76-2.1) and in IOT alone patients mean SUV increase was 1.03-fold (range 0.61-1.45) (P=0.13). The overall normal body SUV from 1st to 2nd scan was stable. Conclusions: This preliminary report suggests that the IOT+SBRT combination could increase CD8+ T-cell uptake in a subset of mRCC patients versus IOT alone. Our upcoming prospective trial will assess 89Zr-Df-crefmirlimab based CD8+ ImmunoPET imaging during and after SBRT alone for mRCC. (Table Presented).

N2  - Objective: To assess the performance of a multimodal seizure detection device, first tested in adults (sensitivity 86%, PPV 49%), in a pediatric cohort living at home or residential care. Methods: In this multicenter, prospective, video-controlled cohort-study, nocturnal seizures were detected by heartrate and movement changes in children with epilepsy and intellectual disability. Participants with a history of >1 monthly major motor seizure wore Nightwatch bracelet at night for 3 months. Major seizures were defined as tonic–clonic, generalized tonic >30 s, hyperkinetic, or clusters (>30 min) of short myoclonic or tonic seizures. The video of all events (alarms and nurse diaries) and about 10% of whole nights were reviewed to classify major seizures, and minor or no seizures. Results: Twenty-three participants with focal or generalized epilepsy and nightly motor seizures were evaluated during 1511 nights, with 1710 major seizures. First 1014 nights, 4189 alarms occurred with average of 1.44/h, showing average sensitivity of 79.9% (median 75.4%) with mean PPV of 26.7% (median 11.1%) and false alarm rate of 0.2/hour. Over 90% of false alarms in children was due to heart rate (HR) part of the detection algorithm. To improve this rate, an adaptation was made such that the alarm was only triggered when the wearer was in horizontal position. For the remaining 497 nights, this was tested prospectively, 384 major seizures occurred. This resulted in mean PPV of 55.5% (median 58.1%) and a false alarm rate 0.08/h while maintaining a comparable mean sensitivity of 79.4% (median 93.2%). Significance: Seizure detection devices that are used in bed which depend on heartrate and movement show similar sensitivity in children and adults. However, children do show general higher false alarm rate, mostly triggered while awake. By correcting for body position, the false alarms can be limited to a level that comes close to that in adults.

N2  - The digital clinical trial is fast emerging as a pragmatic trial that can improve a trial’s design including recruitment and retention, data collection and analytics. To that end, digital platforms such as electronic health records or wearable technologies that enable passive data collection can be leveraged, alleviating burden from the participant and study coordinator. However, there are challenges. For example, many of these data sources not originally intended for research may be noisier than traditionally obtained measures. Further, the secure flow of passively collected data and their integration for analysis is non-trivial. The Apple Heart Study was a prospective, single-arm, site-less digital trial designed to evaluate the ability of an app to detect atrial fibrillation. The study was designed with pragmatic features, such as an app for enrollment, a wearable device (the Apple Watch) for data collection, and electronic surveys for participant-reported outcomes that enabled a high volume of patient enrollment and accompanying data. These elements led to challenges including identifying the number of unique participants, maintaining participant-level linkage of multiple complex data streams, and participant adherence and engagement. Novel solutions were derived that inform future designs with an emphasis on data management. We build upon the excellent framework of the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative to provide a comprehensive set of guidelines for data management of the digital clinical trial that include an increased role of collaborative data scientists in the design and conduct of the modern digital trial.

N2  - Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary tumor with poor prognosis and survival. Patients (pts) experience debilitating symptoms that have a negative effect on quality of life (QoL). A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to facilitate the reduction of morbidity, preserve QoL, and maximize benefits of treatment. Selinexor (SEL) is a first-in class, oral, selective inhibitor of nuclear export that blocks exportin 1 approved for use in multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and has shown activity in GBM. Digital measurements in the KING study through wearable sensors and other devices capture actionable daily data at home for improved care, symptom management, and QoL, are reported here. Methods: XPORT-GBM-029 (NCT04421378) is an ongoing phase 1 dose finding study followed by an open-label randomized phase 2, 5-arm trial to evaluate SEL in combination with standard therapies for newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM (n = 350): radiation+SEL /radiation and temozolomide; radiation and temozolomide±SEL; lomustine±SEL; bevacizumab±SEL; tumor treating field±SEL. The study is conducted at 18 sites in the US and Canada. GBM progression is assessed by standard clinical and imaging as well as QoL measurements by novel digital tools. Four parameters to determine the impact on QoL (cognitive function, lateralization, fatigue, sleep) are measured remotely by smartwatch and smartphone to continuously measure activity and sleep, and to complete a cognitive battery at baseline and before each MRI. Results: To date, pts wearing the smartwatch had higher compliance during the day for activity and gait measures compared to night for sleep measures. Younger pts had better compliance. Over the course of SEL treatment, changes were observed in balance (characterized by double support % and walking asymmetry) and activity level (characterized by step count and walking distance). Of the pts who participated in the cognitive battery (CANTAB) tests, 2 pts had a minor change in cognition measures including psychomotor and processing speed, episodic and spatial working memory, and executive function after 2 SEL treatment cycles. Overall, the CANTAB measures are stable, which align with the mRANO (MRI) results. The correlation between the CANTAB cognition measures and MRI data will be evaluated once more clinical data become available. Ongoing analyses will apply machine learning and statistical tools to determine potential correlations between digital and clinical data, such as physical examinations, AEs, Karnofsky scores, mRANO, NANO, KPS, and PRO QoL questionnaires. Conclusions: This is the first demonstration of digital measurement feasibility in a longitudinal study of pts with GBM. Digital measurements for pts with GBM could provide information on the impact of SEL-based treatment and functional outcomes in clinical trials and increase communication between clinicians and pts, thereby improving QoL and care management.

N2  - (Figure Presented) Introduction: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative treatment option for patients with hematologic conditions but presents complications that must be managed as a complex, chronic condition. Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) may permit tracking of symptoms. To manage the complexities of HCT, our team collaborated with Sicklesoft Inc. to develop an mHealth app for HCT patients, Technology Recordings to better Understand Bone Marrow Transplantation (TRU-BMT). The primary goal of this application is enhancing the monitoring of symptoms and general health of patients undergoing HCT, with the goal of allowing earlier detection of adverse events, earlier intervention, and improving outcomes. Objective: To assess feasibility of TRU-BMT in the adult HCT population in a Phase 1 study. Methods: As a follow-up to the positive feedback from a previous survey, we tested the TRU-BMT app in a Phase 1 pilot study. Thirty patients were enrolled in this single arm study and were given the TRU-BMT mHealth app on a smartphone device in addition to a wearable activity tracker. Patients were followed for up to 180 days, all the while receiving daily app monitoring. At the conclusion of the study, patients were asked to complete a feasibility and acceptability self-report survey. Results: Adherence to TRU-BMT app was approximately 30% daily and 44% weekly, adherence to activity tracker was 58% daily and 83% weekly. Greater adherence to TRU-BMT was associated with increased meal completion (p=0.004), decreased heart rate (p=0.004), and a shorter hospital stay (p=0.03). TRU-BMT assessments of symptom severity were significantly associated with duration of hospital stay (p=<0.001) and development of chronic GVHD (p=0.003). The patient exit survey was score from “0” (lowest rating) to “4” (highest rating). Mean technical feasibility was rated at an average of 3.0 (out of 4), ease of use 3.1 (out of 4), and satisfaction/acceptability at of 2.2 (out of 4). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that using an mHealth app and activity tracker throughout the complex management of HCT is feasible and acceptable. The utilization of TRU-BMT resulted in reasonable adherence similar to the 27-45% published in other studies of mHealth applications (Becker et al., 2013; Min et al., 2014). Adherence may be impacted by health status, given the significant hospitalization rate and the risk of multi-system complications in HCT. Our study provides preliminary evidence that integrating TRU-BMT as an adult HCT mHealth intervention may facilitate an early diagnosis of transplant outcomes, including GVHD. Data gathered in this Phase 1 study will inform the next steps aimed at optimizing the implementation of this approach to assess its clinical significance in early intervention driven by symptom and health monitoring through a future randomized control trial of the TRU-BMT application in HCT.

N2  - Objective: To determine whether a machine learning model can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection from physiological metrics collected from wearable devices. Materials and Methods: Health care workers from 7 hospitals were enrolled and prospectively followed in a multicenter observational study. Subjects downloaded a custom smart phone app and wore Apple Watches for the duration of the study period. Daily surveys related to symptoms and the diagnosis of Coronavirus Disease 2019 were answered in the app. Results: We enrolled 407 participants with 49 (12%) having a positive nasal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test during follow-up. We examined 5 machine-learning approaches and found that gradient-boosting machines (GBM) had the most favorable validation performance. Across all testing sets, our GBM model predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) = 86.4% (confidence interval [CI] 84-89%). The model was calibrated to value sensitivity over specificity, achieving an average sensitivity of 82% (CI ±∼4%) and specificity of 77% (CI ±∼1%). The most important predictors included parameters describing the circadian heart rate variability mean (MESOR) and peak-timing (acrophase), and age. Discussion: We show that a tree-based ML algorithm applied to physiological metrics passively collected from a wearable device can identify and predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusion: Applying machine learning models to the passively collected physiological metrics from wearable devices may improve SARS-CoV-2 screening methods and infection tracking.

N2  - Background: Sleep appears to be a sensitive biomarker that facilitates early detection and effective intervention for Alzheimer's disease, while subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Prefrontal cortex atrophy is associated with both sleep disruption and cognitive decline. Transcranial brain photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy can enhance frontal cortex oxygen consumption, increasing frontal cortex mediated memory function. Objective: This study aimed to test whether PBM therapy targeting the frontal cortex could improve sleep and cognitive function in SCD. Methods: Fifty-eight SCDs were divided into the PBM group (N = 32) in which real light therapy was administered and a sham light therapy group (N = 26). All the participants received either real light or sham light therapy for 6 days consecutively, while the sleep data were recorded. The n-back task was employed to measure each participant's working memory. Results: We found no differences in sleep efficiency change (F = 211, p = 0.279), REM stage percent change (F = 420, p = 0.91), and wake-up time (F = 212, p = 0.277) between the two groups. The sleep efficiency and REM were improved within the true light group on the fifth day. The true light group perform better than the control group in the n-back test, the accuracy was higher in the 2-back test (88.6% versus 79.6%, p = 0.001), and the reaction time in 1-back was shorter (544.80±202.00 versus 592.87±222.05, p = 0.003). Conclusion: After five days of PBM therapy targeting the prefrontal cortex, sleep efficiency and N-back cognitive performance were improved on the fifth day.

N2  - Background: Immunotherapy (IOT) of cancer depends on intratumoral CD8+ cells overcoming multiple obstacles to their localization and function. CD8+ cell content and its changes with treatment are important to understand tumor immunobiology, prognosis, and to guide therapy. Trial design: ImaginAb has developed an imaging agent, 89Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam (formerly 89ZrDf-IAB22M2C/89Zr-Df-crefmirlimab), with an 80 kDa minibody lacking a functional Fc domain, conferring high affinity to CD8, conjugated via deferoxamine to 89Zr for PET imaging: specific binding is to both CD8αα and CD8αβ, facilitating recognition of mature CD8+ cells and a small number of other cell types expressing CD8. The minibody structure was optimized for organ perfusion and pharmacokinetics, thereby maximizing the signal-to-background ratio. The long T1/2 (∼3 d) of 89Zr permits repeat scanning during the week following an infusion. A previous Phase I study of single-dose 89Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam was designed to select the optimum Phase II dose [Pandit-Taskar et al J Nuc Med 2020; Farwell et al J Nuc Med 2021]. After establishing the lack of toxicity across several dose levels, 1 mCi of 89Zr and 1.5 mg of minibody are now being used in Phase II studies. Our recently-completed Ph IIA study was designed to test the correlation of CD8+cells in tumor biopsies with CD8 PET/CT before and during IOT in several tumor types routinely treated with IOT (including melanoma, renal, driver oncogene-negative lung). The present Ph IIB study, (first patient/first visit accomplished in 12/2021) tests the correlation of CD8 PET/CT with subject response by RECIST 1.1 (primary objective), and with lesion response (secondary objective). Adults with solid tumors receive 89Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam i.v. and undergo PET-CT scan 24 hours later (non-contrast CT for localization). IOT (usually one or two immune checkpoint antibodies, using most commonly-used standard-of-care regimen for the disease) is then initiated. A second 89Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam infusion and PET/CT are performed 4-6 weeks after the start of IOT followed 6-8 weeks later by standard tumor assessments (preferably CT with i.v. contrast to obtain RECIST-qualifying measurements). Thereafter, IOT and standard tumor assessments are continued according to standard practice and data for the present study collected up to 12 months after the start of treatment. For participants who progress on treatment there is an optional third 89Zr-crefmirlimab berdoxam infusion and PET/CT. For all participants optional biopsies are collected to coincide with PET/CT timepoints. Accrual is ongoing at three sites in USA, and up to 20 sites globally (USA, Europe and Australia) will participate. The overall accrual goal is 80 patients, distributed across the four tumor types.

N2  - Background: One relevant strategy to prevent the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) focuses on increasing physical activity. The use of activity trackers by patients could enable objective measurement of their regular physical activity in daily life and promote physical activity through the use of a tracker-based intervention. This trial aims to answer three research questions: (1) Is the use of activity trackers suitable for longitudinal assessment of physical activity in everyday life? (2) Does the use of a tracker-based intervention lead to sustainable improvements in the physical activity of healthy individuals and in people with T2DM? (3) Does the accompanying digital motivational intervention lead to sustainable improvements in physical activity for participants using the tracker-based device? Methods: The planned study is a randomized controlled trial focused on 1642 participants with and without T2DM for 9 months with regard to their physical activity behavior. Subjects allocated to an intervention group will wear an activity tracker. Half of the subjects in the intervention group will also receive an additional digital motivational intervention. Subjects allocated to the control group will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome is the amount of moderate and vigorous physical activity in minutes and the number of steps per week measured continuously with the activity tracker and assessed by questionnaires at four time points. Secondary endpoints are medical parameters measured at the same four time points. The collected data will be analyzed using inferential statistics and explorative data-mining techniques. Discussion: The trial uses an interdisciplinary approach with a team including sports psychologists, sports scientists, health scientists, health care professionals, physicians, and computer scientists. It also involves the processing and analysis of large amounts of data collected with activity trackers. These factors represent particular strengths as well as challenges in the study. Trial Registration: The trial is registered at the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform via the German Clinical Studies Trial Register (DRKS), DRKS00027064. Registered on 11 November 2021.

N2  - Importance: Health promotion efforts commonly communicate goals for healthy behavior, but the best way to design goal setting among high-risk patients has not been well examined. Objective: To test the effectiveness of different ways to set and implement goals within a behaviorally designed gamification intervention to increase physical activity. Design, Setting, and Participants: Evaluation of the Novel Use of Gamification With Alternative Goal-setting Experiences was conducted from January 15, 2019, to June 1, 2020. The 24-week randomized clinical trial included a remotely monitored 8-week introductory intervention period, 8-week maintenance intervention period, and 8-week follow-up period. A total of 500 adults from lower-income neighborhoods in and around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who had either an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) condition or a 10-year ASCVD risk score greater than or equal to 7.5% were enrolled. Participants were paid for enrolling in and completing the trial. Interventions: All participants used a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline level, and were then randomly assigned to an attention control or 1 of 4 gamification interventions that varied only on how daily step goals were set (self-chosen or assigned) and implemented (immediately or gradually). Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the 8-week maintenance intervention period. Other outcomes included changes in minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. All randomly assigned participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Results: Of the 500 participants, 331 individuals (66.2%) were Black, 114 were White (22.8%), and 348 were women (69.6%). Mean (SD) age was 58.5 (10.8) years and body mass index was 33.2 (7.8). A total of 215 participants (43.0%) had an ASCVD condition. Compared with the control arm, participants with self-chosen and immediate goals had significant increases in the number of daily steps during the maintenance intervention period (1384; 95% CI, 805-1963; P <.001) that were sustained during the 8-week follow-up (1391; 95% CI, 785-1998; P <.001). This group also had significant increases in daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity during the maintenance intervention (4.1; 95% CI, 1.8-6.4; P <.001) that were sustained during follow-up (3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8; P =.004). No other gamification arms had consistent increases in physical activity compared with the control arm. No major adverse events were reported. Conclusions and Relevance: In this trial among economically disadvantaged adults at elevated risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, a gamification intervention led to increases in physical activity that were sustained during 8 weeks of follow-up when goals were self-chosen and implemented immediately.

N2  - People living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) require lifelong self-management to maintain glucose levels in a safe range. Failure to do so can lead to adverse glycemic events with short and long-term complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is widely used in T1D self-management for real-time glucose measurements, while smartphone apps are adopted as basic electronic diaries, data visualization tools, and simple decision support tools for insulin dosing. Applying a mixed effects logistic regression analysis to the outcomes of a six-week longitudinal study in 12 T1D adults using CGM and a clinically validated wearable sensor wristband (NCT ID: NCT03643692), we identified several significant associations between physiological measurements and hypo- and hyperglycemic events measured an hour later. We proceeded to develop a new smartphone-based platform, ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, and Intelligent System to Enhance Self-care), with an embedded deep learning algorithm utilizing multi-modal data from CGM, daily entries of meal and bolus insulin, and the sensor wristband to predict glucose levels and hypo- and hyperglycemia. For a 60-minute prediction horizon, the proposed algorithm achieved the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 35.28 ± 5.77 mg/dL with the Matthews correlation coefficients for detecting hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia of 0.56 ± 0.07 and 0.70 ± 0.05, respectively. The use of wristband data significantly reduced the RMSE by 2.25 mg/dL (p < 0.01). The well-trained model is implemented on the ARISES app to provide real-time decision support. These results indicate that the ARISES has great potential to mitigate the risk of severe complications and enhance self-management for people with T1D.

N2  - Introduction Cardiorespiratory monitoring is used in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to assess the clinical status of newborn infants and detect critical deteriorations in cardiorespiratory function. Currently, heart rate (HR) is monitored by electrocardiography (ECG) and respiration by chest impedance (CI). Disadvantages of current monitoring techniques are usage of wired adhesive electrodes which may damage the skin and hinder care. The Bambi® belt is a wireless and non-adhesive alternative that enables cardiorespiratory monitoring by measuring electrical activity of the diaphragm via transcutaneous electromyography. A previous study showed feasibility of the Bambi® belt and this study compares the belt performance to ECG and CI. Methods and analysis This multicentre non-inferiority paired study will be performed in the NICU of the Máxima Medical Center (MMC) in Veldhoven and the Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Centre (AmsterdamUMC) in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 39 infants in different postmenstrual age groups (minimally 10 infants<30 weeks, between 30-32 weeks and >32 weeks) will be recruited. These infants will be monitored with the Bambi® belt in addition to standard ECG and CI for 24 hours. The primary outcome is the HR, studied with three criteria: (1) the limits of agreement of the HR measurements in terms of the second-to-second difference in the HR between the belt and standard ECG, (2) the detection of cardiac events consisting of bradycardia and tachycardia and (3) the quality of HR-monitoring. The secondary outcome is the respiratory rate (RR), studied with the criteria (1) agreement in RR-trend monitoring, (2) apnoea and tachypnoea detection and (3) reliable registrations. Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the MMC and the Central Committee for Human Research. The MMC started patient recruitment in July and the AmsterdamUMC in August 2021. The results will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

N2  - Background: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) improves physical activity (PA) and reduces morbidity for patients with cardiovascular disease. We understand little of baseline PA as patients initiate CR, particularly when outside of CR. We used mobile health (mHealth) technology to understand baseline PA of patients initiating CR within a clinical trial to potentially inform personalized care. Methods: The Virtual AppLication-Supported Environment to INcrease Exercise During Cardiac Rehabilitation Study (VALENTINE) Study is a prospective, randomized-controlled, remotely administered trial designed to evaluate an mHealth intervention to supplement CR for low-and moderate-risk patients. Participants are randomized after 2 CR sessions; all receive a smartwatch and usual care. Remotely administered baseline PA outcomes include 6-minute walk distance, step count, and exercise minutes. Baseline PA was assessed for 7-days after study enrollment for compliant days, defined by >8 hours of watch wear/day. Multivariable linear regression identified features associated with baseline PA. Results: From October 19, 2020 to January 31, 2022, 180 participants enrolled. Participants are mostly White [156 (86.7%)]; 59 (32.8%) are female and 69 (38.3%) are > 65 years old. Most enrolled in CR after coronary revascularization [114 (64.4%)] or valve intervention [40 (22.2%)]. Comorbidities include hypertension (65.0%), valve disease (35.6%), and heart failure (17.8%). Participants were compliant for 91.4% of days with 15.3 (4.0) hours/compliant day. Baseline PA included 6-minute walk distance of 491.8 (147.8) meters, daily step count of 6818 (3386), and exercise minutes of 36.0 (33.4). Substantial variation in baseline PA assessed by 6-minute walk distance was noted across age and gender but not CR indication. Conclusions: Understanding baseline PA as participants enroll in CR may be useful in personalizing CR programs at initiation and designing mHealth interventions.

N2  - Background: There is a need for novel alcohol biosensors that are accurate, able to detect alcohol concentration close in time to consumption, and feasible and acceptable for many clinical and research applications. We evaluated the field accuracy and tolerability of novel (BACTrack Skyn) and established (Alcohol Monitoring Systems SCRAM CAM) alcohol biosensors. Methods: The sensor and diary data were collected in a larger study of a biofeedback intervention and compared observationally in the present sub-study. Participants (high-risk drinkers, 40% female; median age 21) wore both Skyn and SCRAM CAM sensors for 1–6 days and were instructed to drink as usual. Data from the first cohort of participants (N = 27; 101 person-days) were used to find threshold values of transdermal alcohol that classified each day as meeting or not meeting defined levels of drinking (heavy, above-moderate, any). These values were used to develop scoring metrics that were subsequently tested using the second cohort (N = 20; 57 person-days). Data from both biosensors were compared to mobile diary self-report to evaluate sensitivity and specificity in relation to a priori standards established in the literature. Results: Skyn classification rules for Cohort #1 within 3 months of device shipment showed excellent sensitivity for heavy drinking (94%) and exceeded expectations for above-moderate and any drinking (78% and 69%, respectively), while specificity met expectations (91%). However, classification worsened when Cohort #1 devices ≥3 months from shipment were tested (area under curve for receiver operator characteristic 0.87 vs. 0.79) and the derived classification threshold when applied to Cohort #2 was inadequately specific (70%). Skyn tolerability metrics were excellent and exceeded the SCRAM CAM (p ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: Skyn tolerability was favorable and accuracy rules were internally derivable but did not yield useful scoring metrics going forward across device lots and months of usage.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the feasibility and efficacy of a health coaching intervention with mobile health technology in older adults with MCI or risk factors for dementia. Background: There is growing evidence that adherence to brain-healthy behaviors can reduce the cognitive decline and risk of dementia. We recently demonstrated that a health coaching intervention facilitated adherence to these healthy lifestyle recommendations (Schwartz et al). The current study enhances the coaching intervention by adding technologies, including a mobile-health platform and wearable fitness trackers. Design/Methods: Participants (target sample 45), age 60-79, with MCI or dementia risk factors are being randomized to two groups: The Brain Health Champion (BHC) intervention or a counseling and education (CE) control. BHC participants work with health coaches over 6 months to set personalized goals, reinforced by weekly video calls, mobile messaging, consultation with a dietitian, and 30-minute in-person or virtual visits every six weeks. In CE, usual care is supplemented with educational materials sent every six weeks. Changes over the six-month intervention in physical activity, diet, cognition, and social/cognitive activities are being measured using validated questionnaires, wearable fitness trackers, and photographed food logs. Results: To date, twenty BHC and eighteen CE participants have completed the study. All participants successfully operated the mobile technology. All BHC participants had increased scores on neuropsychological tests (PACC), social/cognitive activities, and photographed dietary adherence compared to CE. Increased quality of life and physical activity was reported in both groups (60% BHC vs 40% CE). Participation in the study was significantly associated with increased self-reported Mediterranean diet adherence. Conclusions: Preliminary data suggests that both BHC and CE are feasible and encouraging for adopting Brain-healthy behaviors in patients with MCI and dementia risk. BHC group demonstrated more social/cognitive activities and adherence to Mediterranean diet. These strategies may become essential tools to prevent further cognitive decline in these vulnerable populations.

N2  - Background: There is a pressing need for scalable healthcare solutions and a shift in the rehabilitation paradigm from hospitals to homes to tackle the increase in stroke incidence while reducing the practical and economic burden for patients, hospitals, and society. Digital health technologies can contribute to addressing this challenge; however, little is known about their effectiveness in at-home settings. In response, we have designed the RGS@home study to investigate the effectiveness, acceptance, and cost of a deep tech solution called the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS). RGS is a cloud-based system for delivering AI-enhanced rehabilitation using virtual reality, motion capture, and wearables that can be used in the hospital and at home. The core principles of the brain theory-based RGS intervention are to deliver rehabilitation exercises in the form of embodied, goal-oriented, and task-specific action. Methods: The RGS@home study is a randomized longitudinal clinical trial designed to assess whether the combination of the RGS intervention with standard care is superior to standard care alone for the functional recovery of stroke patients at the hospital and at home. The study is conducted in collaboration with hospitals in Spain, Sweden, and France and includes inpatients and outpatients at subacute and chronic stages post-stroke. The intervention duration is 3 months with assessment at baseline and after 3, 6, and 12 months. The impact of RGS is evaluated in terms of quality of life measurements, usability, and acceptance using standardized clinical scales, together with health economic analysis. So far, one-third of the patients expected to participate in the study have been recruited (N = 90, mean age 60, days after stroke ≥ 30 days). The trial will end in July 2023. Discussion: We predict an improvement in the patients’ recovery, high acceptance, and reduced costs due to a soft landing from the clinic to home rehabilitation. In addition, the data provided will allow us to assess whether the prescription of therapy at home can counteract deterioration and improve quality of life while also identifying new standards for online and remote assessment, diagnostics, and intervention across European hospitals. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04620707. Registered on November 3, 2020.

N2  - Background: We developed and validated an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled smartwatch ECG to detect heart failure-reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Methods: This was a cohort study involving two hospitals (A and B). We developed the AI in two steps. First, we developed an AI model (ECGT2T) to synthesize ten-lead ECG from the asynchronized 2-lead ECG (Lead I and II). ECGT2T is a deep learning model based on a generative adversarial network, which translates source ECGs to reference ECGs by learning styles of the reference ECGs. For this, we included adult patients aged ≥18 years from hospital A with at least one digitally stored 12-lead ECG. Second, we developed an AI model to detect HFrEF using a 10 s 12-lead ECG. The AI model was based on convolutional neural network. For this, we included adult patients who underwent ECG and echocardiography within 14 days. To validate the AI, we included adult patients from hospital B who underwent two-lead smartwatch ECG and echocardiography on the same day. The AI model generates a 10 s 12-lead ECG from a two-lead smartwatch ECG using ECGT2T and detects HFrEF using the generated 12-lead ECG. Results: We included 137,673 patients with 458,745 ECGs and 38,643 patients with 88,900 ECGs from hospital A for developing the ECGT2T and HFrEF detection models, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of AI for detecting HFrEF using smartwatch ECG was 0.934 (95% confidence interval 0.913–0.955) with 755 patients from hospital B. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of AI were 0.897, 0.860, 0.258, and 0.994, respectively. Conclusions: An AI-enabled smartwatch 2-lead ECG could detect HFrEF with reasonable performance.

N2  - Background: Stable angina pectoris (SAP) is a highly common condition. Despite optimal medical treatment (OMT) patients often remain symptomatic and at high risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In daily practice the standard treatment consists of OMT usually followed by an invasive strategy, consisting of coronary angiography and subsequent coronary revascularization. However, recent studies showed that these costly and invasive procedures do not result in superior effects on re-events and prognosis as compared to drug therapy alone in patients with SAP. On the other hand, the effect of lifestyle-related interventions on vascular function and the progression of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is well-known. Yet, contemporary RCTs comparing lifestyle interventions with coronary revascularization in patients with SAP are lacking. Purpose: To compare the impact of a 12-month cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programme versus a routinely applied invasive approach (including coronary angiography and subsequent coronary revascularization) on anginal complaints and cost-effectiveness in SAP patients. We hypothesize that CR is at least equally effective as an invasive approach. Methods: 216 SAP patients with residual anginal complaints under OMT will be randomized to usual care or a 12-month CR intervention aiming at angina relief and sustainable behavioural change for long-lasting improvement in cardiovascular health. The CR programme consists of multiple lifestyle interventions including an exercise programme, a dietary intervention and a psychoeducation module with a stepped decline in guidance by health care professionals. Patients in the CR group will receive access to an online platform, a chatbot and a smartwatch enabling patients and professionals to monitor the progress and adherence to lifestyle advices. During the first 3 months patients will receive face to face guidance, the next 3 months will consist of telerehabilitation using the smartwatch with weekly video consulting and the last 6 months will be focussed on relapse prevention and guidance on demand. The primary outcome will be the quantity of anginal complaints (evaluated by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire-7) following the 12-month intervention. Secondary outcomes include cost-effectiveness, the ischemic threshold during exercise, cardiovascular events, exercise capacity, quality of life and psychosocial wellbeing. Future implications This will be the first study evaluating a comprehensive disease-specific multimodal lifestyle intervention as a primary treatment for patients with SAP. If proven successful this study will have a great impact on the daily care of these patients as coronary revascularizations can partly be replaced by a less invasive, less costly and better sustainable treatment.

N2  - Background: Thirty-day readmissions among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) contribute to the US health care burden of preventable complications and costs. Digital health interventions (DHIs) may improve patient health care self-management and outcomes. We aimed to determine if patients with AMI using a DHI have lower 30-day unplanned all-cause readmissions than a historical control. Methods: This nonrandomized controlled trial with a historical control, conducted at 4 US hospitals from 2015 to 2019, included 1064 patients with AMI (DHI n=200, control n=864). The DHI integrated a smartphone application, smartwatch, and blood pressure monitor to support guideline-directed care during hospitalization and through 30-days post-discharge via (1) medication reminders, (2) vital sign and activity tracking, (3) education, and (4) outpatient care coordination. The Patient Activation Measure assessed patient knowledge, skills, and confidence for health care self-management. All-cause 30-day readmissions were measured through administrative databases. Propensity score-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models estimated hazard ratios of readmission for the DHI group relative to the control group. Results: Following propensity score adjustment, baseline characteristics were well-balanced between the DHI versus control patients (standardized differences <0.07), including a mean age of 59.3 versus 60.1 years, 30% versus 29% Women, 70% versus 70% White, 54% versus 54% with private insurance, 61% versus 60% patients with a non ST-elevation myocardial infarction, and 15% versus 15% with high comorbidity burden. DHI patients were predominantly in the highest levels of patient activation for health care self-management (mean score 71.7±16.6 at 30 days). The DHI group had fewer all-cause 30-day readmissions than the control group (6.5% versus 16.8%, respectively). Adjusting for hospital site and a propensity score inclusive of age, sex, race, AMI type, comorbidities, and 6 additional confounding factors, the DHI group had a 52% lower risk for all-cause 30-day readmissions (hazard ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.26-0.88]). Similar results were obtained in a sensitivity analysis employing propensity matching. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in patients with AMI, the DHI may be associated with high patient activation for health care self-management and lower risk of all-cause unplanned 30-day readmissions.

N2  - Background: In-person, exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves physical activity and reduces morbidity and mortality for patients with cardiovascular disease. However, activity levels may not be optimized and decline over time after patients graduate from cardiac rehabilitation. Scalable interventions through mobile health (mHealth) technologies have the potential to augment activity levels and extend the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation. Methods: The VALENTINE Study is a prospective, randomized-controlled, remotely-administered trial designed to evaluate an mHealth intervention to supplement cardiac rehabilitation for low- and moderate-risk patients (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04587882). Participants are randomized to the control or intervention arms of the study. Both groups receive a compatible smartwatch (Fitbit Versa 2 or Apple Watch 4) and usual care. Participants in the intervention arm of the study additionally receive a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) delivered as contextually tailored notifications promoting low-level physical activity and exercise throughout the day. In addition, they have access to activity tracking and goal setting through the mobile study application and receive weekly activity summaries via email. The primary outcome is change in 6-minute walk distance at 6-months and, secondarily, change in average daily step count. Exploratory analyses will examine the impact of notifications on immediate short-term smartwatch-measured step counts and exercise minutes. Conclusions: The VALENTINE study leverages innovative techniques in behavioral and cardiovascular disease research and will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how to support patients using mHealth technologies to promote and sustain physical activity.

N2  - Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is an important cardiac rhythm disorder, which if left untreated can lead to serious complications such as a stroke. AF can remain asymptomatic, and it can progressively worsen over time; it is thus a disorder that would benefit from detection and continuous monitoring with a wearable sensor. We develop an AF detection algorithm, deploy it on a smartwatch, and prospectively and comprehensively validate its performance on a real-world population that included patients diagnosed with AF. The algorithm showed a sensitivity of 87.8% and a specificity of 97.4% over every 5-minute segment of PPG evaluated. Furthermore, we introduce novel algorithm blocks and system designs to increase the time of coverage and monitor for AF even during periods of motion noise and other artifacts that would be encountered in daily-living scenarios. An average of 67.8% of the entire duration the patients wore the smartwatch produced a valid decision. Finally, we present the ability of our algorithm to function throughout the day and estimate the AF burden, a first-of-this-kind measure using a wearable sensor, showing 98% correlation with the ground truth and an average error of 6.2%.

N2  - Objectives: It is currently thought that most—but not all—individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms, but the infectious period starts on average 2 days before the first overt symptoms appear. It is estimated that pre- and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre-symptomatic individuals. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests [to determine if there are antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in the blood] or SARS-CoV-2 infection tests such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the following two algorithms to detect first time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: • The algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition) • The algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition) In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. Trial design: The trial is a randomized, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial. The study will start with an initial learning phase (maximum of 3 months), followed by period 1 (3 months) and period 2 (3 months). Subjects entering the study at the end of the recruitment period may directly start with period 1 and will not be part of the learning phase. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in either period 1 or period 2 and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. Participants: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6500 normal-risk individuals and 3500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID-RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID-RED web portal and self-sampling serology and PCR kits. More information on the study can be found in www.covid-red.eu. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID-RED web portal. After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID-RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: • Resident of the Netherlands • At least 18 years old • Informed consent provided (electronic) • Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocol • Must have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, the study team should be notified) • Be able to read, understand and write Dutch Exclusion criteria: • Previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self-reported) • Current suspected (e.g. waiting for test result) COVID-19 infection or symptoms of a COVID-19 infection (self-reported) • Participating in any other COVID-19 clinical drug, vaccine or medical device trial (self-reported) • Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self-reported) • Pregnant at the time of informed consent (self-reported) • Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelet’s user manual; self-reported) • Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study Intervention and comparator: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronize it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self-reported symptom data within the last 24 h, the Ava COVID-RED app’s underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real-time indicator of their overall health and well-being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self-isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID-19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess the intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). Note that both algorithms will also instruct to seek testing when any SARS-CoV-2 symptoms are reported in line with those defined by the Dutch national institute for public health and the environment ‘Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu’ (RIVM) guidelines. Main outcomes: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID-RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in general and high-risk populations. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with the self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data and the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional twenty secondary and exploratory objectives which address, among others, infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2-infected participants and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme and report the testing result in the Ava COVID-RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self-sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial-affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (between month 0 and 3.5 months after the start of subject recruitment), at the end of the learning phase (month 3; note that this sampling moment is skipped if a subject entered the study at the end of the recruitment period), period 1 (month 6) and period 2 (month 9). These samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing in a trial-affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID-19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the learning phase is positive, or if the subject entered the study at the end of the recruitment period, and samples collected at the end of period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so-called COVID-positive mode in the Ava COVID-RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using the data collected in period 2 (months 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. Randomization: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence, resulting in approximately equal numbers of high-risk and normal-risk individuals between the sequences. Blinding (masking): In this study, subjects will be blinded to the study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on the data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID-RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. Numbers to be randomized (sample size): A total of 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6500 normal-risk and 3500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Trial status: Protocol version: 3.0, dated May 3, 2021. Start of recruitment: February 19, 2021. End of recruitment: June 3, 2021. End of follow-up (estimated): November 2021 Trial registration: The Netherlands Trial Register on the 18th of February, 2021 with number NL9320 (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/9320) Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

N2  - Background: Individuals at increased hereditary risk of cancer are an important target for health promotion and cancer prevention interventions. Health-4-Families uses the Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST) framework and is designed to pilot digital delivery strategies for a distance-based, 16-week intervention to promote weight management, healthy diet, and increased physical activity among individuals with BRCA1/BRCA2 or DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathogenic germline variants. This communication describes participant recruitment and the design of the Health-4-Families pilot study. Methods: Health-4-Families is a full-factorial (16 condition) randomized pilot study of four lifestyle intervention components: social networking, telephone or email coaching, text messaging, and self-monitoring. The primary outcome was feasibility and satisfaction with these study components. Participants with pathogenic germline variants were identified via clinic surveillance lists and advocacy organizations and were invited to participate with family members. All participants had to report meeting at least one of the following criteria: (1) having a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2, (2) consuming <5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day, or (3) getting <150 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity per week. Results: The majority of screened potential participants with pathogenic variants (83%) were eligible; 86% of those eligible provided informed consent and 79% (n = 104) completed baseline. A total of 206 family members were nominated by study participants and 49% (n = 102) completed baseline. Discussion: Recruitment data suggest that individuals with pathogenic germline variants, who are at increased risk for hereditary cancers, are motivated to participate in digital lifestyle interventions. This recruitment success highlights the importance of identifying and prioritizing effective and efficient intervention components for hereditary cancer families. We intend to use the outcomes of our pilot study to inform a fully-powered factorial study for this community.

N2  - Background: A strategy for maintaining and/or improving cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) in the growing population of cancer survivors is of major clinical importance in the COVID-19 era. With the aim of increasing CRF, recent studies have focused on the use of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) in supervised experimental settings, which appeared to be more beneficial than usual care in cancer survivors at all stages of treatment and aftercare. However, the effect of unsupervised HIIT on increasing CRF in breast cancer survivors is not known. Purpose: To determine whether the newly developed habit-B program, which involves home-based smartphone-supported HIIT using body-weight exercises, improves CRF in early-stage breast cancer survivors. We hypothesized that the habit-B program would improve VO2peak compared with a control group. Methods: This single-center, 12-week, parallel-group, single-blind, randomized controlled trial involved 50 women with stage I-IIa breast cancer, aged 20 to 59 years, who had completed initial treatment except for hormone therapy. Participants wore a smartwatch and were randomized to either the exercise or control group from May 27, 2019 through November 30, 2020. The planned sample size was 60 Spatients to detect the increase of 2.0 ml/kg/min change in VO2peak with a standard deviation of 2.6 ml/kg/min, one-sided significance level of 2.5% and 80% power. The exercise group underwent home-based HIIT using a smartphone and a Fitbit Versa thrice weekly for 12 weeks (three times per week). The primary outcome was the 12-week change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak; mL/kg/min) between the groups. Other outcomes included muscle strength, 6-min walk test, resting heart rate, physical activity, fatigue, safety, and quality of life. Results: Of the 50 participants, 44 (exercise group, n=23; control group, n=21) completed the CRF assessment and 6 did not because of issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The change in VO2peak increased significantly in the exercise group (0.9 [95%CI, 0.1 to 1.7]) compared with the control group (-0.8 [95%CI,-1.5 to-0.1]) (mean difference, 1.7 [95% CI, 0.7 to 2.7], p <.01). Leg strength also increased significantly in the exercise group compared with the control group (mean difference, 13.5 [95% CI, 2.9 to 24.1], p <.01). Changes in other outcomes were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: A home-based HIIT intervention can lead to improved cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle strength in early-stage breast cancer survivors; however, a multicenter pragmatic clinical trial is required to confirm the benefits of the habit-B program.

N2  - Objective Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in adolescence, and acute pediatric mental health emergency department (ED) visits have doubled in the past decade. The objective of this study was to evaluate physiologic parameters relationship to suicide severity. Methods This was a prospective, observational study from April 2018 thru November 2019 in a tertiary care pediatric emergency department (ED) and inpatient pediatric psychiatric unit enrolling acutely suicidal adolescent patients. Patients wore a wrist device that used photoplethysmography for 7 days during their acute hospitalization to measure heart rate variability (HRV). During that time, Columbia Suicide Severity Scores (CSSRS) were assessed at 3 time points. Results There was complete device data and follow-up for 51 patients. There was an increase in the high frequency (HF) component of HRV in patients that had a 25% or greater decrease in their CSSRS (mean difference 11.89 ms/ Hz; p-value 0.005). Patients with a CSSRS≥15 on day of enrollment had a lower, although not statistically significant, HF component (mean difference-8.34 ms/ Hz; p-value 0.071). Conclusion We found an inverse correlation between parasympathetic activity measured through the HF component and suicidality in an acutely suicidal population of adolescents. Wearable technology may have the ability to improve outpatient monitoring for earlier detection and intervention.

N2  - The use of wearables is increasing and data from these devices could improve the prediction of changes in glycemic control. We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist-worn or wrist-worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist-worn wearables were used vs. waist-worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes.

N2  - Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is a highly incapacitating symptom that affects many people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cueing triggered upon real-time FOG detection (on-demand cueing) shows promise for FOG treatment. Yet, the feasibility of implementation and efficacy in daily life is still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effectiveness of DeFOG: a smartphone and sensor-based on-demand cueing solution for FOG. Methods: Sixty-two PD patients with FOG will be recruited for this single-blind, multi-center, randomized controlled phase II trial. Patients will be randomized into either the intervention group or the active control group. For four weeks, both groups will receive feedback about their physical activity using the wearable DeFOG system in daily life. In addition, the intervention group will also receive on-demand auditory cueing and instructions. Before and after the intervention, home-based assessments will be performed to evaluate the primary outcome, i.e., “percentage time frozen” during a FOG-provoking protocol. Secondary outcomes include the training effects on physical activity monitored over 7 days and the user-friendliness of the technology. Discussion: The DeFOG trial will investigate the effectiveness of personalized on-demand cueing in a controlled design, delivered for 4 weeks in the patient's home environment. We anticipate that DeFOG will reduce FOG to a greater degree than in the control group and we will explore the impact of the intervention on physical activity levels. We expect to gain in-depth insight into whether and how patients control FOG using cueing methods in their daily lives. Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03978507.

N2  - Background: Commercially available wearable (ambulatory) pulse oximeters have been recommended as a method for managing patients at risk of physiological deterioration, such as active patients with COVID-19 disease receiving care in hospital isolation rooms; however, their reliability in usual hospital settings is not known. Objective: We report the performance of wearable pulse oximeters in a simulated clinical setting when challenged by motion and low levels of arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO2). Methods: The performance of 1 wrist-worn (Wavelet) and 3 finger-worn (CheckMe O2+, AP-20, and WristOx2 3150) wearable, wireless transmission–mode pulse oximeters was evaluated. For this, 7 motion tasks were performed: at rest, sit-to-stand, tapping, rubbing, drinking, turning pages, and using a tablet. Hypoxia exposure followed, in which inspired gases were adjusted to achieve decreasing SaO2 levels at 100%, 95%, 90%, 87%, 85%, 83%, and 80%. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) estimates were compared with simultaneous SaO2 samples to calculate the root-mean-square error (RMSE). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to analyze the detection of hypoxemia (ie, SaO2<90%). Results: SpO2 estimates matching 215 SaO2 samples in both study phases, from 33 participants, were analyzed. Tapping, rubbing, turning pages, and using a tablet degraded SpO2 estimation (RMSE>4% for at least 1 device). All finger-worn pulse oximeters detected hypoxemia, with an overall sensitivity of ≥0.87 and specificity of ≥0.80, comparable to that of the Philips MX450 pulse oximeter. Conclusions: The SpO2 accuracy of wearable finger-worn pulse oximeters was within that required by the International Organization for Standardization guidelines. Performance was degraded by motion, but all pulse oximeters could detect hypoxemia. Our findings support the use of wearable, wireless transmission–mode pulse oximeters to detect the onset of clinical deterioration in hospital settings.

N2  - Background: Obese pregnant women are known to experience poorer pregnancy outcomes and are at higher risk of postnatal arteriosclerosis. Hence, weight control during and after pregnancy is important for reducing these risks. The objective of our planned randomized controlled trial is to evaluate whether the rate of change in body weight in obese women before pregnancy to 12 months postpartum would be lower with the use of an intervention consisting of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and mobile applications during pregnancy to 1 year postpartum compared to a non-intervention group. Methods: Women will be recruited during outpatient maternity checkups at four perinatal care institutions in Japan. We will recruit women at less than 30 weeks of gestation with a pre-pregnancy body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2. The women will be randomly assigned to an intervention or non-intervention group. The intervention will involve using data (weight, body composition, activity, sleep) measured with IoT devices (weight and body composition monitor, activity, and sleep tracker), meal records, and photographs acquired using a mobile application to automatically generate advice, alongside the use of a mobile application to provide articles and videos related to obesity and pregnancy. The primary outcome will be the ratio of change in body weight (%) from pre-pregnancy to 12 months postpartum compared to before pregnancy. Discussion: This study will examine whether behavioral changes occurring during pregnancy, a period that provides a good opportunity to reexamine one's habits, lead to lifestyle improvements during the busy postpartum period. We aim to determine whether a lifestyle intervention that is initiated during pregnancy can suppress weight gain during pregnancy and encourage weight loss after delivery.

N2  - Background: Over a third of excess coronary heart disease mortality in the US is related to inadequate physical activity (PA). Use of wearable activity trackers is beneficial for PA improvement in many populations. However, predictors of long-term adherence to PA remain unknown. Hypothesis: The 1st week PA levels will be the strongest predictors of long-term adherence to the PA goal in adults with overweight or obesity in a mHealth weight loss intervention trial. Methods: A secondary analysis of a 12-month behavioral weight loss trial (SMARTER) that randomized 502 participants to either self-monitoring with tailored feedback messages (SM+FB, n=251) or self-monitoring alone (SM, n=251) was conducted. At baseline, each participant received a Fitbit Charge 2 and PA goal of ≥150 minutes of moderate or vigorous activity (MVPA) per week. The outcome of interest for this analysis was long-term PA adherence, i.e., the number of weeks adherent to PA goal over 12 months. Twenty-six explanatory variables were considered, including treatment assignment; baseline socio-demographics; health history; body mass index (<30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2); psychosocial factors; and1st week PA levels (<150 vs. ≥150 MVPA min/week). Machine learning methods (i.e., random forest regression trees and lasso regression) were used to identify predictors of long-term PA adherence. Results: The sample ranged in age from 19 to 75 years (57% were <50 years old), and was mostly Caucasian (83%), female (80%) and had a mean BMI 33.7 ± 4.0 kg/m2. The sample was randomly split 4:1 into training (n=394) and validation subsamples (n=104) which were comparable by treatment assignment. Both random forest and lasso regression identified 1st week PA levels as the most important predictor of long-term PA adherence. The findings were confirmed in the validation cohort with an out-of-sample R-square of 40.2% from random forest and a R-square of 47.9% from lasso regression, suggesting good predictive abilities. Conclusion: This analysis confirmed higher initial PA levels as the strongest predictor of long-term PA adherence. The findings support screening for PA at study entry and developing tailored interventions for those with lower initial PA levels.

N2  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cause of ischemic stroke that, though critical to diagnose and treat, often goes undetected. Smartwatches are capable of AF detection, but little is known about their use among stroke survivors. In collaboration with stroke survivors and clinicians, we designed a smartphone-smartwatch system for AF detection. In our ongoing clinical trial, we are examining the performance and user experience of the system in older stroke survivors. Hypothesis: The system will be accurate for AF detection among stroke survivors compared to 14- day ECG patch monitoring; participants will find the system usable and will adhere to daily use over 30 days. Methods: The Pulsewatch study is an ongoing two-phased randomized controlled trial with randomization at two timepoints into control or intervention groups. Phase I (14 days) assesses accuracy and usability of the smartwatch and study app. Phase II (30 days) examines watch wear adherence. The intervention group receives a smartwatch with embedded AF detection and a smartphone app for rhythm and symptom tracking. Eligibility criteria are: >50 years old, ischemic stroke in the past decade, and no major contraindications to anticoagulation therapy. System accuracy for AF detection is compared to an ECG patch monitor, and usability is assessed via the System Usability Scale. Adherence is defined as daily watch wear time over the monitoring period. Results: To date, 69 participants have been randomized into phase I and 36 into phase II (mean age 65, 41% female, 87% White). The smartwatch system demonstrated a sensitivity of 66.7% (95% CI: 9.4 - 99.2) and specificity of 92.6% (95% CI: 82.1 - 97.9) for detection of 3 AF cases over the 14 day period (91.2% accuracy) compared to the ECG patch. The mean usability score was 65/100 and on average, participants wore the watch on 12/30 days for an average of 1.8 hours (SD 0.7) daily. Conclusion: A smartwatch and app dyad demonstrated reasonable accuracy for AF detection and high usability, though adherence was modest. Use of commercial wearables for AF detection among stroke patients shows promise, but additional data from the ongoing Pulsewatch clinical trial will continue to inform strategies to maximize adherence to these devices among older adults.

N2  - Early detection of influenza may improve responses against outbreaks. This study was part of a clinical study assessing the efficacy of a novel influenza vaccine, aiming to discover distinct, highly predictive patterns of pre-symptomatic illness based on changes in advanced physiological parameters using a novel wearable sensor. Participants were frequently monitored 24 h before and for nine days after the influenza challenge. Viral load was measured daily, and self-reported symptoms were collected twice a day. The Random Forest classifier model was used to classify the participants based on changes in the measured parameters. A total of 116 participants with ~3,400,000 data points were included. Changes in parameters were detected at an early stage of the disease, before the development of symptomatic illness. Heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance showed the greatest changes in the third post-exposure day, correlating with viral load. Applying the classifier model identified participants as flu-positive or negative with an accuracy of 0.81 ± 0.05 two days before major symptoms appeared. Cardiac index and diastolic blood pressure were the leading predicting factors when using data from the first and second day. This study suggests that frequent remote monitoring of advanced physiological parameters may provide early pre-symptomatic detection of flu.

N2  - Background: Postoperative hypotension associated with postoperative morbidity and early mortality has been studied previously. Hypertension and other hemodynamic, respiratory, and temperature abnormalities have comparatively understudied during the first postoperative days. Methods: This bi-centre observational cohort study will include 114 adult patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery hospitalized on an unmonitored general care floor and wearing a multi-signal wearable sensor, allowing remote monitoring ( Biobeat Technologies Ltd, Petah Tikva, Israel). The study will cover the first 72 hours after discharge of the patient from the post-anaesthesia care unit. Several thresholds will be used for each variable (arterial pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and skin temperature). Data obtained using the sensor will be compared to data obtained during the routine nurse follow-up. The primary outcome is hemodynamic abnormality. The secondary outcomes are postoperative respiratory and temperature abnormalities, artefacts and blank/null outputs from the wearable device, postoperative complications, and finally, the ease of use of the device. We hypothesize that remote monitoring will detect abnormalities in vital signs more often or more quickly than the detection by nurses' routine surveillance. Discussion: A demonstration of the ability of wireless sensors to outperform standard monitoring techniques paves the way for the creation of a loop which includes this monitoring mode, the automated creation of alerts, and the sending of these alerts to caregivers.

N2  - Importance: Passive and non-invasive identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a challenge. Widespread use of wearable devices represents an opportunity to leverage physiological metrics and fill this knowledge gap. Objective: To determine whether a machine learning model can detect SARS-CoV-2 infection from physiological metrics collected from wearable devices. Design: A multicenter observational study enrolling health care workers with remote follow-up. Setting: Seven hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City Participants: Eligibility criteria included health care workers who were ≥18 years, employees of one of the participating hospitals, with at least an iPhone series 6, and willing to wear an Apple Watch Series 4 or higher. We excluded participants with underlying autoimmune/inflammatory diseases, and medications known to interfere with autonomic function. We enrolled participants between April 29th, 2020, and March 2nd, 2021, and followed them for a median of 73 days (range, 3-253 days). Participants provided patient-reported outcome measures through a custom smartphone application and wore an Apple Watch, collecting heart rate variability and heart rate data, throughout the follow-up period. Exposure: Participants were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection over time due to ongoing community spread. Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as ±7 days from a self-reported positive SARS-CoV-2 nasal PCR test. Results: We enrolled 407 participants with 49 (12%) having a positive SARS-CoV-2 test during follow-up. We examined five machine-learning approaches and found that gradient-boosting machines (GBM) had the most favorable 10-CV performance. Across all testing sets, our GBM model predicted SARS-CoV-2 infection with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC)=85% (Confidence Interval 83-88%). The model was calibrated to improve sensitivity over specificity, achieving an average sensitivity of 76% (CI ±~4%) and specificity of 84% (CI ±~0.4%). The most important predictors included parameters describing the circadian HRV mean (MESOR) and peak-timing (acrophase), and age. Conclusions and Relevance: We show that a tree-based ML algorithm applied to physiological metrics passively collected from a wearable device can identify and predict SARS-CoV2 infection. Utilizing physiological metrics from wearable devices may improve screening methods and infection tracking.

N2  - Background: The importance of timely treatment of advanced NSCLC and timeline measurements have been the subject of reported studies. Real world evidence data (RWED) via EHR and cutting-edge technology paired with Belong.life pts engagement platform, was evaluated in Israeli pts with NSCLC, members of Belong.life community. Timelines from diagnosis to start of IOT were analyzed by data scientists using AI and machine learning engines. Methods: 30 Israeli pts with advanced NSCLC, members of Belong.life, the largest global social media platform for cancer pts and caregivers, were screened during 2016-8. Demographics, time of diagnosis, time of starting IOT and reasons for treatment delays were documented. Results: 18 pts (60%) were males and 88% had Stage 4. Most pts (87%) were diagnosed during 2017-8. 46 % were < 60 yrs and 54% > 61 yrs. 18 (60%) pts received only pembrolizumab while 11 (37%) pts had it in combination with various chemotherapy drugs. 1 pt received single agent nivolumab. According to the dates reported by 22 (76%) pts, the median time from diagnosis to IOT initiation was 37 days(< 20-96) with 13(59%) starting the treatment in < 40 days. Most common delay causes were due to waiting for genetic tests to define targeted therapy (38%), protracted diagnostic phase (38%) and bureaucratic issues in 27%. Study limitations included its retrospective nature, a convenience sampling, and partial reliance on pts recall of dates. Conclusions: Healthcare systems are seeing an increase in the incidence of most cancers. We report marked variability in time to initiation of 1st LOT therapy of Israeli pts with advanced NSCLC. The common reasons for the delays were obtaining the molecular tests results in order to define targeted drugs and as more targets and their therapies become available this period might increase. Treatment delays are likely to have a negative impact on pts well-being, quality of life and long-term prognosis. Speeding up diagnosis and treatment planning process could decrease pts waiting time, improve their quality of life and expectancy, therefore consideration to the development of a time to treatment protocol should be prioritized.

N2  - Background: Assessment of disease progression in the early manifest stages of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a challenge with current endpoints. PD clinical research is at the forefront of using Digital Health Technologies (DHT), including wearable devices and smartphones, to detect early changes in many symptoms of importance to patients. To achieve regulatory acceptance to use DHT in clinical drug trials, several gaps and challenges are yet to be addressed. Regulatory agencies have recommended that public private partnerships (PPP) play a key role in advancing the field while including regulators in the process. Existing PPP in the PD space may provide a template for achieving regulatory maturity for DHT in the AD space. Objectives: To describe the Critical Path for Parkinson's (CPP) consortium's Digital Drug Development Tools (3DT) initiative, aimed at advancing the regulatory maturity of DHT as drug development tools for PD, and discuss relevance to AD drug development. Methods: CPP consists of pharmaceutical companies, academic advisors, non-profit research organizations, and regulatory agency representatives. The Digital Drug Development Tools (3DT) group has been created under the auspices of the CPP consortium as a dedicated team that is sharing knowledge and data in the precompetitive space. A staged plan has been initiated which aims to advance a data driven collaboration framework to collectively advance the DHT field in a device agnostic way. Critical Path Institute receives generous funding from the FDA, and both FDA and EMA are actively engaged in the consortium. Critically, the 3DT group also works directly with people living with PD. Results: CPP is leveraging the ongoing, prospective study called WATCH-PD (Wearable Assessments in The Clinic and Home in PD, NCT03681015), a multicentre, prospective, longitudinal, digital assessment study of PD progression in subjects with early, untreated PD, as an exemplar pilot study to facilitate discussion and alignment with regulatory agencies on evidentiary considerations for DHT for drug development. WATCH-PD has an emphasis on changes in motor symptoms, but cognition, sleep, psychiatric status, quality of life, and activity patterns are also assessed, and many of these are relevant to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Regulatory feedback from the FDA's Critical Path Innovation Meeting and EMA's Innovative Task Force briefing meeting provided input on key topics including technical, acquisition and analytical recommendations, including controlling sources of variability in the data, determining clinical meaningfulness of both motor and non-motor the relevance of DHT outcome to patients' perception of function, and importance of evaluating DHT performance in normative controls. In response, a normative sub study has been added to the WATCH-PD study, co-funded by the 3DT members. Moreover, the 3DT group has developed consensus recommendations on security best practices and for sponsors conducting DHT studies to align with patient needs to enhance compliance. Two workstreams have aligned on outlining case studies for documenting metadata standards for studies employing DHT and identifying sources of variability that are key to design of ongoing and future studies. Conclusions: Many of the learnings of CPP's 3DT team are relevant in AD drug development. CPP's progress to date has provided a framework for multiple sponsors who have agreed to collaborate on optimizing the use of DHT in future PD clinical trials. Regulatory agencies have encouraged CPP to continue to have iterative, data-driven, disease-specific discussions, including strategies for establishing meaningful clinical endpoints, controlling sources of variability, and evaluating DHT performance in normative as well as diseased cohorts. Many of the issues being addressed in CPP 3DT apply also to the use of DHT in other neurodegenerative diseases including AD. We therefore propose that similar frameworks and strategies could accelerate development of DHT for AD and beyond.

N2  - Background: A reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤35% ≥6 weeks following an acute myocardial infarction (MI) may indicate prophylactic implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). We sought to find predictors of absence of significant left ventricular (LV) remodeling post-MI. Methods: All consecutive patients hospitalized for acute MI with an LVEF ≤35% at discharge in our institution from 2010 were retrospectively included. Patients were assigned to two groups according to the persistence of an LVEF ≤35% (ICD+) or a recovery >35% (ICD-). Logistic regression was performed to build a predictive score, which was then externally validated. Results: Among a total of 1533 consecutive MI patients, 150 met inclusion criteria, 53 (35%) in the ICD+ group and 97 in the ICD group. After multivariable analyses, an LVEF ≤25% at discharge (adjusted OR 6.23 [2.47 to 17.0], p <.0001) and a CPK peak at the MI acute phase >4600 UI/L (adjusted OR 9.99 [4.27 to 25.3], p <.0001) both independently predicted non-recovery at 6 weeks. The IC-D (Increased Cpk—LV Dysfunction) score predicted persistent LVEF ≤35% with areas under curve of 0.83 and 0.73, in the study population and in a multicenter validation cohort of 150 patients, respectively (p <.0001). Conclusions: The association of a severely reduced LVEF and a major release of myocardial necrosis biomarkers at the acute phase of MI predict unfavorable remodeling, and prophylactic ICD implantation.

N2  - Background and Aims: Exposure to extremely low frequency and low intensity electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) increases plasticity-related processes, with associated clinical improvements. The purpose of this RCT was to explore the benefit of BrainQ's novel and non-invasive, brain-computer interface-based, frequency-tuned ELF-EMF treatment (BQ) in improving upper extremity motor function (UEMF) in subacute ischemic stroke. Methods: Study was planned for n=50, but was discontinued due to COVID-19 at n=25. Participants were randomized to receive 40 minutes of BQ (active or sham) 5 days/week, for 8 weeks, with 10 minutes of PT. BQ uses machine learning algorithms to extract motor-related spectral features in EEG for use as treatment frequencies, and is delivered via a wearable and portable device. Results: Primary endpoint: Fugl-Meyer Assessment - Upper Extremity improved significantly (and sooner) in the treatment group versus sham at W4 (23.2±3.91 vs. 9.9±3.2; 13.6 points greater than sham p=0.0070) and after 8 weeks of treatment (31.5±2.97 vs. 23.1±4.99; p=0.0611). Secondary endpoints: Most strikingly, and as a major clinical indication of reduced disability, mRS, at W9 the treatment group showed a mean improvement of 2.5±0.18 points versus 1.3±0.16 points in the sham group (p=0.0005), i.e., a mean of 1.2 points higher than that of the sham group. Significant improvements were also observed in the ARAT-Pinch subscale (W9: p=0.0082), BBT (W6: p=0.0169; W9: p<0.0001), and NIHSS (W9: p=0.0340). Conclusions: BQ treatment significantly improves UEMF and reduces disability in subacute ischemic stroke across multiple metrics. A pivotal study is planned, with an explicit motivation of moving toward home use, for a more patient-centric approach.

N2  - Introduction: The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) uses surface electrodes built into the vest to detect underlying arrhythmia before initiating a treatment sequence. However, it is also prone to inappropriate detection due to artefacts. Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the alarm burden in patients and its possible impact on clinical outcomes. Methods: The Swiss WCD Registry is a nationwide, retrospective, observational registry. Patients were included from December 2011 until February 2018. Clinical characteristics and data from the WCDs, including alarm burden were analysed. Recordings ≥30 seconds of length were analysed and categorized as VT/VF, atrial fibrillation (AF), supraventricular tachycardia or artefact. Results: A total of 10'653 device alarms were documented in 324 of 456 patients (71.1%) over a mean WCD wear-time of 2.0±1.6 months. Among these, the episode duration was 30 seconds or more in 2996 (28.2%). One hundred and eleven (3.7%) were VT/VF episodes. The remaining recordings were inappropriate arrhythmia detections (2736 (91%) due to artefacts; 117 (3.7%) AF; 48 (1.6%) supraventricular tachycardia). Twohundred and seven patients (45.0%) had 3 or more alarms per month, whereas 49 patients (10.7%) had 1 or more alarms per day. Body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in patients with 3 or more alarms per month (p=0.002, 25.6 vs. 27.3 kg/m2) High alarm burden was not associated with a lower average daily wear time (20.8 hours vs 20.7 hours, p=0.785) or a decreased implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation rate after stopping WCD use (48% vs 47.3%, p=0.156). Conclusions: In patients using WCDs, alarms emitted by the device and impending inappropriate shocks were frequent and most commonly caused by artefacts. A high alarm burden did not lead to a decreased adherence, as determined by average daily wear-times. Obesity was significantly associated with a higher alarm burden.

N2  - Recognition of early signs of deterioration in postoperative course could be improved by continuous monitoring of vital parameters. Wearable sensors could enable this by wireless transmission of vital signs. A novel accelerometer-based device, called Healthdot, has been designed to be worn on the skin to measure the two key vital parameters respiration rate (RespR) and heart rate (HeartR). The goal of this study is to assess the reliability of heart rate and respiration rate measured by the Healthdot in comparison to the gold standard, the bedside patient monitor, during the postoperative period in bariatric patients. Data were collected in a consecutive group of 30 patients who agreed to wear the device after their primary bariatric procedure. Directly after surgery, a Healthdot was attached on the patients’ left lower rib. Vital signs measured by the accelerometer based Healthdot were compared to vital signs collected with the gold standard patient monitor for the period that the patient stayed at the post-anesthesia care unit. Over all patients, a total of 22 hours of vital signs obtained by the Healthdot were recorded simultaneously with the bedside patient monitor data. 87.5% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 beats per minute for HeartR and 92.3% of the data met the pre-defined bias of 5 respirations per minute for RespR. The Healthdot can be used to accurately derive heart rate and respiration rate in postbariatric patients. Wireless continuous monitoring of key vital signs has the potential to contribute to earlier recognition of complications in postoperative patients. Future studies should focus on the ability to detect patient deterioration in low-care environments and at home after discharge from the hospital.

N2  - Abstract Background: Exposure of the central nervous system to extremely low frequency and low intensity electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMF) increases plasticity-related processes, with associated clinical improvements. Aim: The purpose of this RCT was to explore the benefit of BrainQ’s novel and non-invasive stimulation device which uses frequency-tuned ELF-EMF treatment (BQ) to reduce general disability and improve upper extremity motor function (UEMF) in subacute ischemic stroke. Methods: Study was planned for n=50, but was discontinued due to COVID-19 at n=25. Participants were randomized to receive 40 minutes of BQ (active or sham) 5 days/week, for 8 weeks, with 10 minutes of PT. BQ uses brain-computer interface-based machine learning algorithms to extract motor-related spectral features in EEG for use as treatment frequencies, and is delivered via a wearable and portable device. Results: Primary endpoint: Fugl-Meyer Assessment – Upper Extremity improved significantly (and sooner) in the treatment group versus sham at W4 (23.2±3.91 vs. 9.9±3.2; 13.6 points greater than sham p=0.0070) and after 8 weeks of treatment (31.5±2.97 vs. 23.1±4.99; p=0.0611). Secondary endpoints: Most strikingly, and as a major clinical indication of reduced disability, mRS, at W9 the treatment group showed a mean improvement of 2.5±0.18 points versus 1.3±0.16 points in the sham group (p=0.0005), i.e., a mean of 1.2 points higher than that of the sham group. Significant improvements were also observed in the ARAT–Pinch subscale (W9: p=0.0082), BBT (W6: p=0.0169; W9: p<0.0001), and NIHSS (W9: p=0.0340). Conclusion: BQ treatment significantly reduces general disability and improves UEMF in subacute ischemic stroke across multiple metrics. A pivotal study is planned, with an explicit motivation of moving toward home use, for a more patient-centric approach.

N2  - Objective: Exercise is recommended for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but the most effective exercise prescription is unclear. This trial compared effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT), continuous aerobic exercise training (CAET) and no-exercise control on reproductive, anthropometric and cardiometabolic outcomes in PCOS. Design: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants: Previously inactive women aged 18–40 years with PCOS. Measurements: Feasibility outcomes included recruitment, retention, adherence to exercise and daily ovulation prediction kit (OPK) testing. Preliminary efficacy outcomes included reproductive, anthropometric and cardiometabolic health markers. Results: Forty-seven women were randomized to no-exercise control (n = 17), HIIT (n = 16), or CAET (n = 14). Forty (85%) participants completed the trial. Median exercise adherence was 68% (IQR 53%, 86%). Median daily OPK-testing adherence in the first half of the intervention was 87% (IQR 61%, 97%) compared with 65% (IQR 0%, 96%) in the second half. Body mass index decreased significantly in CAET compared with control (−1.0 kg/m2, p =.01) and HIIT (−0.9 kg/m2, p =.04). Mean waist circumference decreased in all groups (−7.3 cm, −6.9 cm, −4.5 cm in HIIT, CAET and control) with no significant between-group differences. Mean LDL-C was significantly reduced for HIIT compared to CAET (−0.33 mmol/L, p =.03). HDL-C increased in HIIT compared with control (0.18 mmol/L, p =.04). Conclusions: There were feasibility challenges with adherence to daily ovulation assessment limiting the ability to analyse the effect of the exercise interventions on ovulation. CAET and HIIT were both effective at improving anthropometrics and some cardiometabolic health markers. Further studies need to determine optimal and acceptable exercise prescriptions for this population.

N2  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common neoplasms in Europe, with annual incidence of 336.000. PCa patients frequently encounter health-related quality of life (QOL) issues commonly underestimated.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is used in several healthcare domains, offering the advantage of continuous training on large datasets. The aim of ASCAPE Project is to leverage the advances in Big Data and AI, to support patients with PCa, regarding QOL issues. METHODS: ASCAPE is a collaborative project with 15 partners (Greece, United Kingdom, Sweden, Spain, Germany, Serbia, Romania), taking place in 3 phases. In phase 1, large retrospective datasets will be analyzed to train AI-based models for QOL issues (fatigue, depression, anxiety, incontinence-erectile dysfunction after surgery, hot flushes). During phase 2, a prospective study will be performed, including data collection from validated questionnaires and wearable data for active monitoring of physical activity, sleep pattern and heart rate. Both retrospective and prospective data will be incorporated in an ASCAPE-integrated prototype, which will permit personalized, AI-based predictions and intervention suggestion. In phase 3, evaluation of ASCAPE from patient and physician perspective will be performed, using specific key performance indicators. Eligible patients will have biopsy proven PCa of any stage, who undergo surgery or radiation therapy, with or without hormonal therapy and will be able to use smartwatches to collect data. All patients will participate after signing an informed consent. Follow-up duration will be 12 months after surgery or initiation of radiation therapy, while questionnaires (EORTC-QLQ C30, EORTC- QLQ PR25, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire, International Index of Erectile Function questionnaire) will be completed every 3 months. Three centers (UK, Sweden, Greece) will recruit patients, while estimated number is 300 patients. RESULTS: Figure CONCLUSIONS: The aim of ASCAPE is to improve QOL of patients with PCa, using AI to detect QOL issues earlier and suggest interventions, based on already successful treatments in patients with similar experiences. Continuous learning and improvement of AI algorithms, makes this project very promising for the field of QOL in PCa.

Secondary outcomes: Patients who reached discharge criteria within the 7th day from admission; difference in MC incidence at the conclusion of the standard telemonitoring/clinical monitoring phase, 5 and 30 days after discharge; and conditions predisposing to MC occurrence. Methods: Open label randomized controlled trial with wearable wireless system that creates alerts on portable devices. Continuous glycemic monitoring is performed for patients with diabetes mellitus. Results: There were 110 patients enrolled (mean age: 76.2 years). Comorbidity: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS-CI (comorbidities index): 3.93, CIRS SI (severity index): 1.93. About 19% scored a BRASS (Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score) ≥20 indicating need for discharge planning requiring step-down care. Globally, 48% of patients in the control group had major complications (27 out of 56 patients), in contrast to 22% in the intervention group (12 out of 54 patients). Conclusions: Since WVPCM detects early complications during the post-discharge CPs monitoring, it increases safety and reduces inappropriate access to the Emergency Room, preventing avoidable re-hospitalizations.

N2  - Background and Aims: Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes up to 1 in 5 strokes. During our COVID pandemic response, ambulatory ECG monitoring post-Stroke/TIA changed from 5-day event recorder to 14-day Zio Service. Referral using an aetiological classification algorithm was encouraged. Methods: During 5 months in 2020, 423 patients with neurologistdiagnosed stroke/TIA received the Zio service. AF detection rate and duration of analysable ECG was extracted from electronic records for randomly selected 181 patients. Detection rate was compared with a similarly random historic sample of 131 stroke/TIA patients' 5-day event recorder monitoring. Results: Average duration of analysable ECG was 12.3 days,<5 day recording in only 7.7% of cases. AF was detected in 9.7% of recordings of confirmed stroke patients; patients with recent infarcts in multiple vascular territories on imaging had the highest yield (20%). There was no significant difference between different stroke types (Oxford Classification) and AF detection rate. (x2=0.91, n=93, P=.82) AF detection in TIA was lower at 2.5%. Post-hoc case review showed lower AF yield where TIA diagnosis was “possible/probable” (0/79) compared to “definite” (2/79) but this was not statistically significant (P=.49, Fisher exact test) Historical AF detection rate in 5-day event recorder (n=131) was 3.8%. (x2=0.51 compared with Zio service, P=.48). Patient feedback for the ZIO service was positive. Conclusions: The Zio service effectively detected AF after stroke and confirmed TIA. Detection rates were higher than for 5-day event recordings, though no aetiological classification algorithm was previously used. Further evaluation of this algorithm is warranted to aid patient selection.

N2  - Background and Aims: The detection rate of hidden atrial fibrillation (AF) decreases with time after stroke, but in real clinical practice it is not always possible to initiate early prolonged cardiac monitoring. We analyzed the efficacy of AF detection in patients with ESUS who are monitored up to 12 months after the episode. Methods: Prospective multicenter study of prolonged 30 days cardiac monitoring with a wearable holter in patients with ESUS in Andalusia, Spain. We analyzed the time to initiation of monitoring in those patients in whom AF was detected and described their baseline characteristics. Results: 352 patients included, AF was detected in 17% (60). Mean age of the AF patients was 72.3 years, 45.8% were women. 74.6% had hypertension, 50.8% dyslipidemia, and 39% diabetes. Median CHA2DS2-VASc=5 and HAS-BLED=3. Mean time to AF detection was 107 days and time in AF rhythm was 1826 minutes (approximately 30 hours). Of AF-detected patients, 56.7% (34) started monitoring in the first 3 months after stroke, 21.7% (13) in the period from 3 to 6 months, 8.3% (5) in 6 to 9 months, and 13.3% (8) in 9 to 12 months. From the total number of patients with AF, 46.7% (28) were detected in the first month after stroke. Conclusions: Prolonged cardiac monitoring for 30 days is more effective in detecting AF in the first months after stroke. However, there are patients in whom it is possible to detect AF after this time, so cardiac monitoring within the first year may be useful in well-selected patients.

N2  - Importance: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurring after cardiac surgery is associated with adverse outcomes. Whether POAF persists beyond discharge is not well defined. Objective: To determine whether continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring enhances detection of POAF among cardiac surgical patients during the first 30 days after hospital discharge compared with usual care. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study is an investigator-initiated, open-label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial conducted at 10 Canadian centers. Enrollment spanned from March 2017 to March 2020, with follow-up through September 11, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrollment stopped on July 17, 2020, at which point 85% of the proposed sample size was enrolled. Cardiac surgical patients with CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65-74 years, female sex) score greater than or equal to 4 or greater than or equal to 2 with risk factors for POAF, no history of preoperative AF, and POAF lasting less than 24 hours during hospitalization were enrolled. Interventions: The intervention group underwent continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring with wearable, patch-based monitors for 30 days after randomization. Monitoring was not mandated in the usual care group within 30 days after randomization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was cumulative AF and/or atrial flutter lasting 6 minutes or longer detected by continuous cardiac rhythm monitoring or by a 12-lead electrocardiogram within 30 days of randomization. Prespecified secondary outcomes included cumulative AF lasting 6 hours or longer and 24 hours or longer within 30 days of randomization, death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, non-central nervous system thromboembolism, major bleeding, and oral anticoagulation prescription. Results: Of the 336 patients randomized (163 patients in the intervention group and 173 patients in the usual care group; mean [SD] age, 67.4 [8.1] years; 73 women [21.7%]; median [interquartile range] CHA2DS2-VASc score, 4.0 [3.0-4.0] points), 307 (91.4%) completed the trial. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the primary end point occurred in 32 patients (19.6%) in the intervention group vs 3 patients (1.7%) in the usual care group (absolute difference, 17.9%; 95% CI, 11.5%-24.3%; P <.001). AF lasting 6 hours or longer was detected in 14 patients (8.6%) in the intervention group vs 0 patients in the usual care group (absolute difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 4.3%-12.9%; P <.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In post-cardiac surgical patients at high risk of stroke, no preoperative AF history, and AF lasting less than 24 hours during hospitalization, continuous monitoring revealed a significant increase in the rate of POAF after discharge that would otherwise not be detected by usual care. Studies are needed to examine whether these patients will benefit from oral anticoagulation therapy. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02793895.

N2  - Background: Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) occurrence over a long duration has been a challenge in the screening and follow-up of AF patients. Wearable devices may be an ideal solution. Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of a recently developed smart wristband device that is equipped with both photoplethysmographic (PPG) and single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) systems and an AF-identifying, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, used in the short term. Methods: Use of the Amazfit Health Band 1S, which records both PPG and single-channel ECG data, was assessed in 401 patients (251 normal individuals and 150 ECG-diagnosed AF patients). Results: ECG and PPG readings could not be judged in 15 and 18 subjects, respectively. Subjects who were unable to be judged were defined as either false negative or false positive. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of wristband PPG readings were 88.00%, 96.41%, and 93.27%, respectively, and those of wristband ECG readings were 87.33%, 99.20%, and 94.76%, respectively. When the original wristband ECG records were judged by physicians, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 96.67%, 98.01%, and 97.51%, respectively. Conclusion: This promising new combination of PPG, ECG, and AI algorithm has the potential to facilitate AF detection.

N2  - Objectives: It is currently thought that most—but not all—individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms, but that the infectious period starts on average two days before the first overt symptoms appear. It is estimated that pre- and asymptomatic individuals are responsible for more than half of all transmissions. By detecting infected individuals before they have overt symptoms, wearable devices could potentially and significantly reduce the proportion of transmissions by pre-symptomatic individuals. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests [to determine if there are antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in the blood] or SARS-CoV-2 infection tests such as polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the following two algorithms to detect first time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection:the algorithm using Ava bracelet data when coupled with self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo; experimental condition)the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone (Symptom Only Algo; control condition) In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. Trial design: The trial is a randomized, single-blinded, two-period, two-sequence crossover trial. All subjects will participate in an initial Learning Phase (varying from 2 weeks to 3 months depending on enrolment date), followed by two contiguous 3-month test phases, Period 1 and Period 2. Each subject will undergo the experimental condition (the Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) in one of these periods and the control condition (Symptom Only Algo) in the other period. The order will be randomly assigned, resulting in subjects being allocated 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition first) or Sequence 2 (control condition first). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. Participants: The trial will be conducted in the Netherlands. A target of 20,000 subjects will be enrolled. Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk individuals and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Subjects will be recruited from previously studied cohorts as well as via public campaigns and social media. All data for this study will be collected remotely through the Ava COVID-RED app, the Ava bracelet, surveys in the COVID-RED web portal, and self-sampling serology and PCR kits. During recruitment, subjects will be invited to visit the COVID-RED web portal (www.covid-red.eu). After successfully completing the enrolment questionnaire, meeting eligibility criteria and indicating interest in joining the study, subjects will receive the subject information sheet and informed consent form. Subjects can enrol in COVID-RED if they comply with the following inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria:Resident of the NetherlandsAt least 18 years oldInformed consent provided (electronic)Willing to adhere to the study procedures described in the protocolMust have a smartphone that runs at least Android 8.0 or iOS 13.0 operating systems and is active for the duration of the study (in the case of a change of mobile number, study team should be notified)Be able to read, understand and write Dutch Exclusion criteria:Previous positive SARS-CoV-2 test result (confirmed either through PCR/antigen or antibody tests; self-reported)Previously received a vaccine developed specifically for COVID-19 or in possession of an appointment for vaccination in the near future (self-reported)Current suspected (e.g., waiting for test result) COVID-19 infection or symptoms of a COVID-19 infection (self-reported)Participating in any other COVID-19 clinical drug, vaccine, or medical device trial (self-reported)Electronic implanted device (such as a pacemaker; self-reported)Pregnant at time of informed consent (self-reported)Suffering from cholinergic urticaria (per the Ava bracelet’s User Manual; self-reported)Staff involved in the management or conduct of this study Intervention and comparator: All subjects will be instructed to complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app daily, wear their Ava bracelet each night and synchronise it with the app each day for the entire period of study participation. Provided with wearable sensor and/or self-reported symptom data within the last 24 hours, the Ava COVID-RED app’s underlying algorithms will provide subjects with a real-time indicator of their overall health and well-being. Subjects will see one of three messages, notifying them that: no seeming deviations in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected; some changes in symptoms and/or physiological parameters have been detected and they should self-isolate; or alerting them that deviations in their symptoms and/or physiological parameters could be suggestive of a potential COVID-19 infection and to seek additional testing. We will assess intraperson performance of the algorithms in the experimental condition (Wearable + Symptom Data Algo) and control conditions (Symptom Only Algo). Main outcomes: The trial will evaluate the use and performance of the Ava COVID-RED app and Ava bracelet, which uses sensors to measure breathing rate, pulse rate, skin temperature, and heart rate variability for the purpose of early and asymptomatic detection and monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in general and high-risk populations. Using laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections (detected via serology tests, PCR tests and/or antigen tests) as the gold standard, we will determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for each of the following two algorithms to detect first-time SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection: the algorithm using Ava Bracelet data when coupled with the self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data, and the algorithm using self-reported Daily Symptom Diary data alone. In addition, we will determine which of the two algorithms has superior performance characteristics for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection including early or asymptomatic infection as confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 virus testing. The protocol contains an additional seventeen secondary outcomes which address infection incidence rates, health resource utilization, symptoms reported by SARS-CoV-2 infected participants, and the rate of breakthrough and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections among individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. PCR or antigen testing will occur when the subject receives a notification from the algorithm to seek additional testing. Subjects will be advised to get tested via the national testing programme, and report the testing result in the Ava COVID-RED app and a survey. If they cannot obtain a test via the national testing programme, they will receive a nasal swab self-sampling kit at home, and the sample will be tested by PCR in a trial-affiliated laboratory. In addition, all subjects will be asked to take a capillary blood sample at home at baseline (Month 0), and at the end of the Learning Phase (Month 3), Period 1 (Month 6) and Period 2 (Month 9). These samples will be used for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody testing in a trial-affiliated laboratory, differentiating between antibodies resulting from a natural infection and antibodies resulting from COVID-19 vaccination (as vaccination will gradually be rolled out during the trial period). Baseline samples will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of the Learning Phase is positive, and samples collected at the end of Period 1 will only be analysed if the sample collected at the end of Period 2 is positive. When subjects obtain a positive PCR/antigen or serology test result during the study, they will continue to be in the study but will be moved into a so-called “COVID-positive” mode in the Ava COVID-RED app. This means that they will no longer receive recommendations from the algorithms but can still contribute and track symptom and bracelet data. The primary analysis of the main objective will be executed using data collected in Period 2 (Month 6 through 9). Within this period, serology tests (before and after Period 2) and PCR/antigen tests (taken based on recommendations by the algorithms) will be used to determine if a subject was infected with SARS-CoV-2 or not. Within this same time period, it will be determined if the algorithms gave any recommendations for testing. The agreement between these quantities will be used to evaluate the performance of the algorithms and how these compare between the study conditions. Randomisation: All eligible subjects will be randomized using a stratified block randomization approach with an allocation ratio of 1:1 to one of two sequences (experimental condition followed by control condition or control condition followed by experimental condition). Based on demographics, medical history and/or profession, each subject will be stratified at baseline into a high-risk and normal-risk group within each sequence, resulting in equal numbers of high-risk and normal-risk individuals between the sequences. Blinding (masking): In this study, subjects will be blinded as to study condition and randomization sequence. Relevant study staff and the device manufacturer will be aware of the assigned sequence. The subject will wear the Ava bracelet and complete the Daily Symptom Diary in the Ava COVID-RED app for the full duration of the study, and they will not know if the feedback they receive about their potential infection status will only be based on data they entered in the Daily Symptom Diary within the Ava COVID-RED app or based on both the data from the Daily Symptom Diary and the Ava bracelet. Numbers to be randomised (sample size): 20,000 subjects will be recruited and randomized 1:1 to either Sequence 1 (experimental condition followed by control condition) or Sequence 2 (control condition followed by experimental condition), taking into account their risk level. This results in approximately 6,500 normal-risk and 3,500 high-risk individuals per sequence. Trial Status: Protocol version: 1.2, dated January 22nd, 2021 Start of recruitment: February 22nd, 2021 End of recruitment (estimated): April 2021 End of follow-up (estimated): December 2021 Trial registration: The trial has been registered at the Netherlands Trial Register on the 18th of February, 2021 with number NL9320 (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/9320) Full protocol: The full protocol is attached as an additional file, accessible from the Trials website (Additional file 1).

N2  - Purpose: The care of patients undergoing cardiac surgery is becoming more complex, owing to increased burdens of comorbid disease, frailty, psychosocial issues and complex pathology. Cardiac rehabilitation is a well-established way to improve the outcomes of patients after a cardiac event or cardiac surgery but is a highly reactive approach. Cardiac prehabilitation on the other hand is proactive and evidence suggests that improving aerobic conditioning, respiratory muscle training, lifestyle modification, diabetic control and sleep may improve outcomes. There are however barriers to implementing these changes which may be overcome with a carefully designed program. Methods: All adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery electively with a minimum wait period of 4-weeks prior to surgery will be recruited in absence of exclusion criteria. They will be randomised to the intervention or conventional care. The intervention is a multidisciplinary led (cardiac surgery, anaesthesia, intensive care, exercise physiology, psychology and nursing) intervention that is a home-based walking program. Subjects will be recruited on the day of their first appointment and all face-to-face follow-ups will be done at the same time as pre-existing appointments to minimise cost to patient and hospital. Patients will be provided with an accelerometer wearable device (FitBit) to measure exercise and provided with motivational support and information via social media (a closed Facebook group) and text messaging. Geographical concerns have been alleviated by the use of a home-based program and have applicability to Australian populations with rural and remote patients. Results: Primary outcomes are Days Alive Out of Hospital at 90 days and length of stay. Secondary outcomes include cost of stay, cardiometabolic markers, motivation to exercise, quality of life, attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. Conclusions: The optimal cardiac prehabiliation program remains unclear but whatever it looks like, a low-cost, home-based and scalable program has promising applicability to Australian patients. Specifically targeting modifiable perioperative risk factors may reduce adverse outcomes after surgery.

N2  - Background: The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) uses surface electrodes built into the vest to detect underlying arrhythmia before initiating a treatment sequence. Before a shock is administered an alarm consisting of vibratory and auditory signals is emitted to warn the patient. Some patients frequently experience alarms. The aim of this study is to assess the alarm burden in patients and its possible impact on clinical outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the alarm burden in patients and its possible impact on clinical outcomes. Methods: The Swiss WCD Registry is a nationwide retrospective registry including patients with a history of WCD use. Patients were included since 2011 until February 2018. Baseline characteristics and data on WCD usage were analysed. As sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) requires arrhythmia duration of ≥30s, only recordings ≥30s of length were analysed and categorized as appropriate (VT/VF), or inappropriate (atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and artefact). Results: A total of 10’653 alarms were documented in the total registry including 456 patients over a mean WCD wear-time of 2 months (±1.6). One hundred and thirty-two patients (28.9%) had zero alarms. A recording with a length ≥30s was present in 2996. One hundred and eleven (3.7%) of these were VT/VF episodes. The remaining recordings were inappropriate arrhythmia detections: 2736 artefacts (91%), 117 atrial fibrillation episodes (3.7%) and 48 supraventricular tachycardia episodes (1.6%). Two-hundred and seven patients (45%) had ≥3 alarms per months, and 49 patients (10.7%) had ≥1 alarm per day. BMI ≥30kg/m2 was significantly associated with ≥3 alarms per month (p=0.002), and increasing BMI correlated with increasing total number of alarms (p<0.001). ≥3 alarms per months were not associated with a lower average daily wear time (20.8 vs 20.7 hours, p=0.785) or a decreased ICD implantation rate after stopping WCD use (48 vs 47.3%, p=0.156). Conclusion: Inappropriate alarms emitted by the WCD are frequent and significantly associated with obesity. They did not lead to a decreased adherence to WCD therapy.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce the risk of organ failure and mortality in systemic inflammatory conditions. Heart rate variability (HRV) has potential for early identification of the onset of systemic inflammation, as it may detect changes in sympathetic nervous system activity resulting from the developing inflammatory response before clinical signs appear. With the use of new methodologies, we investigated the onset and kinetics of HRV changes as well as several inflammatory parameters and symptoms during experimental human endotoxemia, a model of systemic inflammation in humans in vivo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Healthy volunteers were intravenously administered LPS (n = 15) or placebo (n = 15). HRV was determined using a wireless wearable device, and parameters low to high frequency (LF:HF) ratio, root mean square of the successive differences (RMSSD), and standard deviation of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN)were calculated through 1-min-rolling 6-min windows. Plasma cytokine levels and flu-like symptoms and vital signs were serially assessed. RESULTS: The increase in LF:HF ratio, reflecting sympathetic predominance, was more pronounced in the LPS group compared to the placebo group, with the difference becoming statistically significant 65 min following LPS administration (1.63 [1.42-1.83] vs. 1.28 [1.11-1.44], P = 0.005). Significant between-group differences in RMSSD and SDNN were observed from 127 to 140 min post-LPS administration onwards, respectively. Plasma cytokine levels showed significant between-group differences staring 60 min post-LPS. For symptom score, heart rate, temperature, and diastolic blood pressure, significant differences compared with the placebo group were observed at 90, 118, 120, and 124 min post-LPS, respectively. CONCLUSION: In a controlled human model of systemic inflammation, elevations in the LF:HF ratio followed very shortly after elevations in plasma cytokine levels and preceded onset of flu-like symptoms and alterations in vital signs. HRV may represent a promising non-invasive tool for early detection of a developing systemic inflammatory response.

N2  - Purpose: Alcohol use has historically been associated with a reduction in average heart rate variability (HRV). The purpose of this presentation is to explore the ability to detect changes in HRV using a commercially available wearable device. Methods: This trial included 20 young adult females (ages 18-24) who participated in a 15-day randomized control trial including daily behavioral assessments while wearing a commercially available biosensor ring (ura). Based on the ura ring application, daily report of mean HRV was calculated. A detailed daily questionnaire of drinking behaviors, including number and types of drink, peak intoxication, and consequences associated with alcohol use were also completed. Results: Initial results controlling for repeated measures within participant using a linear mixed model, suggest that alcohol use was related to a weakened mean HRV. We examined alcohol use among participants based on night before self-reported peak intoxication level: no drinking, no buzz, slight buzz, a little drunk, or really drunk. Results suggest that intoxication level, compared to very drunk, was statistically significant in relation to HRV. Among those who reported not consuming alcohol the night before, mean HRV was 46.75 ms (SD = 28.66 ms, n = 184 observations, t = 7.70, p < 0.001). Moreover, reported alcohol use with intoxication levels of no buzz, slight buzz, a little drunk, and really drunk resulted in mean HRV of 38.23 ms (SD = 12.52 ms, n = 31 observations, t = 5.74, p < 0.001), 35.42 ms (SD = 14.29 ms, n = 24 observations, t = 4.09, p < 0.001), 42.60 ms (SD = 31.42 ms, n = 15 observations, t = 2.09, p < 0.05), and 25.15 ms (SD = 13.38 ms, n = 13 observations, referent group), respectively. Overall, reported alcohol use the night before resulted in a mean HRV of 36.11 ms (SD = 18.09), compared to 46.77 ms (SD = 28.73) for those who did not report drinking before bed. These results suggest that alcohol use the night before was statistically significant in relation to HRV (t = 6.18, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings are novel in replicating the impact alcohol use on HRV using a consumer wearable device. Additional research should be done on the long-term effects of alcohol use on HRV with wearable technology.

Baseline characteristics and data on WCD usage were analysed. Recordings ≥30s of length were analysed and categorized as ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF), atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia and artefact. Shorter recordings were deemed inappropriate due to the detection algorithm of the WCD.

BMI ≥30kg/m2 was significantly associated with ≥3 alarms per month (p=0.002), and increasing BMI correlated with increasing total number of alarms (p< 0.001). ≥3 alarms were not associated with a lower average daily wear time (20.8 vs 20.7 hours, p=0.785) or a decreased ICD implantation rate after stopping WCD use (48 vs 47.3%, p=0.156). Conclusion: Inappropriate alarms emitted by the WCD are frequent and significantly associated with obesity. They did not lead to a decreased adherence to WCD therapy. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction Neutropenic fever following high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a common (incidence 63-100%) and potentially life-threatening complication. Recommended time to antibiotic (TTA) administration is within 1 hr of fever onset with delays associated with significant morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality. Standard of care guidelines emphasize patient self-monitoring for fever, with instructions to seek immediate medical attention if body temperature (temp) reaches 100.4°F or higher. In this study, we evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temp monitor, tPatch, could reliably estimate core body temp and detect fever in an outpatient setting following ASCT. Additionally, we gathered preliminary data to explore early detection and prediction of clinically relevant temp rise in this clinical setting. Methods Patients (N = 86) with hematologic malignancies (62% multiple myeloma) who underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT at Mayo Clinic, MN were prospectively enrolled between June 2018 and March 2019. Patients (82% male) wore an axilla-placed tPatch continuously for 7 days in an outpatient setting during the post ASCT period and were asked to record self-measured oral temp in 3-4 hr intervals daily using a standardized thermometer after appropriate training. Patients followed standard of care procedures with daily clinic assessment of temp, blood counts, and vital signs. An optional patient questionnaire was given at end-of-study. A model was trained using both patient- and clinic-assessed oral temp measures to estimate core temp from 2 sensors on the tPatch device. Core temp estimates and trends were then compared to patient- and clinic-assessed measurements. Fever was defined as a temperature ≥100.4°F for at least 1 hr. Results When compared to all oral temp reads, the tPatch estimated core temp within 0.03 ± 0.7℉. Among the 86 patients, clinic-assessed fever incidence was 29.4% while tPatch-assessed incidence was 58.8%. Using all clinic-recorded temp readings as “ground truth,” the sensitivity and specificity of the tPatch algorithm in detecting fevers were 88% and 86%, respectively, while patient self fever detection sensitivity was 62% and specificity 93%. With “fever episode” defined as a temp ≥100.4°F for at least 1 hr, tPatch detected 9.6 times the number of fever episodes vs. clinic reads. The average lead time of tPatch detection of clinic-recorded fevers was 3.7 hours. In 25% of all intervals between clinic temp readings, either tPatch or patients detected at least 1 fever episode. The tPatch was well-tolerated, the only adverse events reported were grade 1 skin irritation and discomfort in 4 (5%) patients. Of 65 patients who completed the survey, 95% reported the tPatch as “quite” or “somewhat” comfortable and 94% stated no difficulty in using the tPatch. Exploration of tPatch temp trends over various time intervals for use in fever prediction is ongoing. Conclusions Patient self-monitoring of temp has low sensitivity and is not feasible for long intervals of time (e.g., overnight). Continuous temperature monitoring by a wearable device overcomes these challenges and has the potential to improve early detection and consequently shorten time to antibiotic initiation. A follow-up randomized study is planned to assess the clinical benefits of continuous temp monitoring through patient and clinician alerts triggering early clinical intervention for febrile neutropenia.

N2  - Purpose: Cancer survivors are often sedentary. Self-monitoring may promote physical activity through self-activation. We conducted a pilot trial to evaluate whether wearable activity tracker with personalized text message feedback would increase physical activity. Methods: We enrolled 30 patients with solid tumor cancers into a non-randomized prospective intervention trial (NCT02627079): 15 had completed treatment in the past year and 15 under active treatment. Each participant received an activity tracker and daily text messages personalized to their activity level. We assessed patient-reported outcomes and 6-min walk (6 MW) at baseline and 3 months. Results: Twenty-six participants completed the study. There was substantial variation in baseline activity. Overall, 39% of participants increased their steps taken by at least 20%, and 23% increased their 6 MW distance by 20% or more. More participants who had completed treatment strongly agreed (73%) that the intervention increased their exercise levels than those receiving active treatment (47%). At 3 months, there was a significant improvement in median Beck Depression Inventory-II and Godin Leisure Index composite scores. At 6 months, 72% still wore their activity tracker at least 4 days per week. Conclusion: We found that the intervention was well-accepted with a high completion rate at 3 months and continued self-use at 6 months. In this pilot study of combined activity tracker and motivational messaging, we found a signal for increased physical activity over a 3-month period. Future research is needed to study this technique for its impact on activity and other physical and psychological measures of well-being. Implication for cancer survivors: Activity tracker with personalized motivational messaging may be useful in promoting physical activity in cancer survivors.

N2  - Background: Circadian and sleep disturbances are associated with increased risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Wearable activity trackers could provide a new approach in diagnosis and prevention. Objective: To evaluate sleep and circadian rhythm parameters, through wearable activity trackers, in MCI and AD patients as compared to controls, focusing on sex dissimilarities. Methods: Based on minute level data from consumer wearable devices, we analyzed actigraphic sleep parameters by applying an electromedical type I registered algorithm, and the corresponding circadian variables in 158 subjects: 86 females and 72 males (42 AD, 28 MCI, and 88 controls). Moreover, we used a confusion-matrix chart method to assess accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of two decision-tree models based on actigraphic data in predicting disease or health status. Results: Wake after sleep onset (WASO) was higher (p<0.001) and sleep efficiency (SE) lower (p=0.003) in MCI, and Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) was lower in AD patients compared to controls (p=0.004). SE was lower in male AD compared to female AD (p=0.038) and SRI lower in male AD compared to male controls (p=0.008), male MCI (p=0.047), but also female AD subjects (p=0.046). Mesor was significantly lower in males in the overall population. Age reduced the dissimilarities for WASO and SE but demonstrated sex differences for amplitude (p=0.009) in the overall population, controls (p=0.005), and AD subjects (p=0.034). The confusion-matrices showed good predictive power of actigraphic data. Conclusion: Actigraphic data could help identify disease or health status. Sex (possibly gender) differences could impact on neurodegeneration and disease trajectory with potential clinical applications.

N2  - Background Tumor infiltration by CD8 T cells is associated with favorable outcomes to immunotherapy (IOT). However, biopsies to assess T cell infiltration are invasive and prone to sampling error. CD8 PET imaging could provide an effective non-invasive method of visualizing T cell trafficking and tumor infiltration and predicting early response to IOT. Methods A phase 1 first-in-human PET imaging study using an anti-CD8 radiolabeled Minibody, 89Zr-IAB22M2C (CD8- tracer), to detect whole body and tumor CD8 distribution in patients with metastatic solid tumors was completed. Patients received 3 mCi 89Zr-IAB22M2C followed by serial PET scans over a 5-7-day period. A two-stage design included protein dose escalation phase1 (n=6, 0.2 mg to 10 mg API) to establish safety and optimal scanning parameters and a dose expansion phase focusing on two API doses (0.5 mg (n=4) or 1.5 mg (n=5) API). All patients were monitored for drugrelated adverse events with blood chemistry, hematology, cytokine assay and anti-drug antibodies (ADA). Biodistribution, radiodosimetry and SUV PET uptake was performed in all patients. Results 15 subjects (31-82 years, M/F = 9/6) with metastatic melanoma (n=8), NSCLC (n=6), and HCC (n=1) were enrolled. Treatment histories included naïve (n=2), discontinued prior IOT (n=3), active IOT (n=10). No drug-related AEs nor abnormal laboratory tests were noted except for a transient increase in ADA in 1 subject. The CD8-tracer accumulated in tumors and CD8 rich tissues (e.g. spleen, marrow, nodes) with maximum uptake at 24-48 hours post injection along with low background activity in non-T cell rich tissues (e.g. muscle, heart). More favorable dosimetry was seen at 1.5 mg versus 0.5 mg API (effective dose=0.64 mSv/MBq versus 0.67 mSv/MBq, respectively). Comparison of 1.5 mg and 0.5 mg API in expansion cohorts demonstrated similar uptake in nodes but with reduced uptake in marrow and spleen at the higher API. Tracer-uptake in tumors was noted in 10/15 (67%) subjects, favoring slightly higher tumor uptake in the 1.5 mg cohort. One patient with advanced melanoma on IOT had increased CD8-tracer uptake in several metastases on an early post treatment scan, which correlated with response (figure 1). Conclusions 89Zr-IAB22M2C targets CD8+ rich tissues and visualizes whole-body biodistribution of CD8+ cells in tumors and reference tissues and may predict early response to IOT. A 1.5 mg protein dose provides similar distribution to 0.5 mg dose, with more favorable dosimetry and is used in the ongoing Phase 2 study.

N2  - Introduction: External recorders allow for low-cost, non-invasive 1 to 4 weeks monitoring. However, the first 3 months of monitoring duration are the most effective to detect atrial fibrillation (AF). We show the results of the Thunder registry of patients monitored to detect AF during 90 days from the stroke. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted with consecutive inclusion of patients with cryptogenic stroke after work up (neuroimaging, echocardiography and 24-hour cardiac monitoring) in 5 Comprenhensive Stroke Centers. Patients were continuously monitored for 90 days with a wearable Holter (Nuubo®) after the first 24 hours of the stroke onset. We analyzed the percentage of AF detection in each period (percentage of AF among those monitored), the quality of the monitoring (monitoring time), the percentage of AF by intention to monitor (detection of AF among patient included). Demographic, clinical and echocardiographic predictors of AF detection beyond one week of cardiac monitoring were assessed. Results: A total of 254 patients were included. The cumulative incidence of AF detection at 90 days was 34.84%. The monitoring time was similar among the 3 months (30 days: 544.9 hours Vs 60 days: 505.9 hours Vs 90 days: 591.25 hours) (p=0.512). The number of patients who abandoned monitoring was 7% (18/254). The cumulative percentage of intention to detect AF was 30.88% (Figure). Patients who completed monitoring beyond 30 days had higher score on the NIHSS basal scale (NIHSS 9 IQR 2-17) VS (NIHSS 3 IQR 1-9) (p=0.024). Patients with left atrial volume greater than 28.5ml/m2 had higher risk of cumulative incidence of AF according to the Kaplan Meyer curve beyond the first week of monitoring OR 2.72 (Log-rank (Mantel-Cox test) (p<0.001). Conclusions: In conclusion, intensive 90-day- Holter monitoring with textile Holter was feasible and detected high percentage of AF. Enlarged left atrial volume predicted AF beyond the first week of monitoring.(Figure Presented).

N2  - BACKGROUND: Intensive lifestyle interventions are effective in reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes, but the implementation of learnings from landmark studies is expensive and time consuming. The availability of digital lifestyle interventions is increasing, but evidence of their effectiveness is limited. OBJECTIVE: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to test the feasibility of a web-based diabetes prevention program (DPP) with step-dependent feedback messages versus a standard web-based DPP in people with prediabetes. METHODS: We employed a two-arm, parallel, single-blind RCT for people at high risk of developing diabetes. Patients with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level of 39-47 mmol/mol were recruited from 21 general practices in London. The intervention integrated a smartphone app delivering a web-based DPP course with SMS texts incorporating motivational interviewing techniques and step-dependent feedback messages delivered via a wearable device over 12 months. The control group received the wearable technology and access to the web-based DDP but not the SMS texts. As this was a feasibility study, the primary aim was to estimate potential sample size at different stages of the study, including the size of the target study population and the proportion of participants who consented, were randomized, and completed follow-up. We also measured the main outcomes for a full-scale RCT, namely, change in weight and physical activity at 6- and 12-month follow-ups, and secondary outcomes, including changes in the HbA1c level, blood pressure, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and lipid levels. RESULTS: We enrolled 200 participants: 98 were randomized to the intervention and 102 were randomized to the control group. The follow-up rate was higher in the control group (87/102, 85.3%) than in the intervention group (69/98, 70%) at 12 months. There was no treatment effect on weight at 6 months (mean difference 0.15; 95% CI -0.93 to 1.23) or 12 months (mean difference 0.07 kg; 95% CI -1.29 to 1.44) or for physical activity levels at 6 months (mean difference -382.90 steps; 95% CI -860.65 to 94.85) or 12 months (mean difference 92.64 steps; 95% CI -380.92 to 566.20). We did not observe a treatment effect on the secondary outcomes measured at the 6-month or 12-month follow-up. For the intervention group, the mean weight was 92.33 (SD 15.67) kg at baseline, 91.34 (SD 16.04) kg at 6 months, and 89.41 (SD 14.93) kg at 12 months. For the control group, the mean weight was 92.59 (SD 17.43) kg at baseline, 91.71 (SD 16.48) kg at 6 months, and 91.10 (SD 15.82) kg at 12 months. In the intervention group, the mean physical activity was 7308.40 (SD 4911.93) steps at baseline, 5008.76 (SD 2733.22) steps at 6 months, and 4814.66 (SD 3419.65) steps at 12 months. In the control group, the mean physical activity was 7599.28 (SD 3881.04) steps at baseline, 6148.83 (SD 3433.77) steps at 6 months, and 5006.30 (SD 3681.1) steps at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that it is feasible to successfully recruit and retain patients in an RCT of a web-based DPP.

N2  - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative treatment option for patients with hematologic conditions but presents many complications that must be managed as a complex, chronic condition. Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) may permit tracking of symptoms in HCT. In seeking strategies to manage the complexities of HCT, our team collaborated with Sicklesoft, Inc., to develop an mHealth app specifically for HCT patients to allow for daily evaluation of patient health, Technology Recordings to better Understand Bone Marrow Transplantation (TRU-BMT). The primary value of this application is that of potentially enhancing the monitoring of symptoms and general health of patients undergoing HCT, with the ultimate goal of allowing earlier detection of adverse events, earlier intervention, and improving outcomes. To first evaluate patient interest in mHealth apps, we designed and administered an interest survey to patients at the 2017 BMT-InfoNet reunion. As a follow-up to the positive feedback received, we began testing the TRU-BMT app in a Phase 1 pilot study. Thirty patients were enrolled in this single-arm study and were given the TRU-BMT mHealth app on a smartphone device in addition to a wearable activity tracker. Patients were followed for up to 180 days, all the while receiving daily app monitoring. Adherence to TRU-BMT was approximately 30% daily and 44% weekly, and greater adherence was associated with increased meal completion, decreased heart rate, and shorter hospital stay. TRU-BMT assessments of symptom severity were significantly associated with duration of hospital stay and development of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Our findings suggest that using TRU-BMT throughout HCT is feasible for patients and established a proof-of-concept for a future randomized control trial of the TRU-BMT application in HCT. © 2021 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

N2  - Background And Aims: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common treatable risk factor for stroke. However, it is uncertain whether screening for AF in asymptomatic individuals is effective. Methods: This investigator-initiated randomized trial recruited individuals from primary care practices in Canada and Germany aged ≥75 years with hypertension and no history of AF or anticoagulant use. Eligible participants were assigned a 2-week wearable ECG (Zio XT patch) at baseline and at 3 months (screening group) or usual care (control group). The primary outcome was AF detected within 6 months by study monitors (≥5 minutes) or clinically. Secondary outcomes included device adherence and anticoagulation at 6 months. Results: From March 2015- April 2019, we enrolled 856 participants from 48 practices: age 80.0±4.0 years; 56.9% female; median CHA2DS2-VASc score 4 points (IQR 4-5). Median ECG wear time was 27.4 days (IQR 18.4-28.0). AF was detected in 23/434 participants (5.3%) in the screening group vs. 2/ 422 (0.5%) in the control group; p<0.0001. Median duration of the longest device-detected AF episode per patient was 5.0 hours (IQR 2.8-9.9 hours; range 5 min.-13.9 days); median number of AF episodes per patient was 2 (IQR 1-3; range 1-76). Anticoagulation was initiated in 80% of patients with screendetected AF. At 6 months, anticoagulant use was greater in the screening group (4.1% vs. 0.9%; p=0.003). No patient had a major bleed. Conclusions: Among older community-dwelling individuals, AF screening with wearable ECGs was feasible, superior to standard care for detecting actionable AF (number needed to screen=21), and prompted anticoagulation with the potential to avert future strokes.

N2  - Research Objective: Lower extremity joint replacement (LEJR) is the most common inpatient surgery for Medicare beneficiaries with substantial variation in cost and quality. Remote monitoring and insights from behavioral science have the potential to improve outcomes and value of care. We evaluated the impact of activity monitoring and bidirectional text messaging on the rate of patient discharge to home and clinical outcomes. Study Design: This was a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial conducted between February 2018 and April 2019 at two urban hospitals in a large academic health system (clinicaltrials. gov NCT0335549). Eligible patients were randomized evenly, with a waiver of informed consent, and stratified by hospital location and joint type (knee or hip) to receive (1) usual care, or (2) HomeConnect + . Intervention patients were invited to participate in HomeConnect+ by mailed invitation followed by up to 4 phone calls. Those who agreed received a wearable activity monitor (Withings) to track step counts, pain score tracking, messaging about post-operative goals and milestones, and connection to clinicians as needed. Those in HomeConnect+ were further randomized evenly to (2a) remote monitoring alone or (2b) remote monitoring with gamification and social support. HomeConnect+ was offered before surgery, began at hospital discharge, and continued for 45 days post-discharge. The primary outcome was discharge to home. Pre-specified secondary outcomes included change in average daily step count from week 2 to week 6, rehospitalizations, and outpatient visits. Population Studied: We included patients aged 18-85 scheduled to undergo lower extremity joint replacement surgery (knee or hip) with a Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool score of 6-8. We excluded patients with dementia, end-stage renal disease, cirrhosis, metastatic cancer, and those scheduled for bilateral or revision surgery. Principal Findings: A total of 242 patients were included in the analysis (124 usual care, 118 intervention) with a mean age of 66, including 78% female, 46% white, and 43% black patients. 81% in the intervention arm agreed to receive monitoring. There was no significant difference in the rate of discharge to home between the usual care (58%) and intervention (57%) arms; no difference in office visits between arms; and no significant increase in step count in those receiving remote monitoring plus gamification and social support compared to remote monitoring alone. There was a statistically significant reduction in rehospitalization rate in the intervention arm compared to the usual care arm (3.4% vs 12.2%; P = .01). Conclusions: The HomeConnect+ automated hovering program did not increase discharge to home from the hospital after LEJR surgery, and there was no difference in activity levels among those receiving gamification and social support compared to remote monitoring alone. However, there was a significant reduction in rehospitalizations among those receiving the intervention, which may have resulted from goal setting and connection to the care team. Implications for Policy or Practice: Automated hovering was not sufficient to increase discharge to home among patients with a moderate expected rate of facility placement. However, it has the potential to reduce hospitalizations after LEJR surgery, an important quality and value outcome for hospitals and payers.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Gait is a sensitive marker for functional declines commonly seen in patients treated for advanced cancer. We tested the effect of a combined exercise and nutrition programme on gait parameters of advanced-stage cancer patients using a novel wearable gait analysis system. METHODS: Eighty patients were allocated to a control group with nutritional support or to an intervention group additionally receiving whole-body electromyostimulation (WB-EMS) training (2×/week). At baseline and after 12 weeks, physical function was assessed by a biosensor-based gait analysis during a six-minute walk test, a 30-s sit-to-stand test, a hand grip strength test, the Karnofsky Index and EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and inflammation by blood analysis. RESULTS: Final analysis included 41 patients (56.1% male; 60.0 ± 13.0 years). After 12 weeks, the WB-EMS group showed higher stride length, gait velocity (p < .05), six-minute walking distance (p < .01), bodyweight and skeletal muscle mass, and emotional functioning (p < .05) compared with controls. Correlations between changes in gait and in body composition, physical function and inflammation were detected. CONCLUSION: Whole-body electromyostimulation combined with nutrition may help to improve gait and functional status of cancer patients. Sensor-based mobile gait analysis objectively reflects patients' physical status and could support treatment decisions.

N2  - Objectives/Introduction: Multiple forms of circadian and sleep disturbances are associated with an increased risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Wearable activity trackers could help understand the underlying pathophysiology and provide a new approach in diagnosis and prevention. Objective: To evaluate differences in sleep parameters and circadian rhythms, through wearable activity trackers, in patients with MCI and AD as compared to controls, focusing on sex dissimilarities. Methods: Based on minute level data obtained from consumer wearable devices, we analyzed actigraphic sleep parameters by applying an electromedical type I registered algorithm, and the corresponding circadian variables in 158 age-matched subjects, 86 females and 72 males (42 AD, 28 MCI, and 88 healthy volunteers). Moreover, we used a confusion-matrix chart method to assess accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of two decision-tree models based on actigraphic data in predicting disease (MCI or AD) or health status. Results: Wake after sleep onset (WASO) resulted significantly higher (p < 0.001) and sleep efficiency (SE) significantly lower (p = 0.003) in MCI subjects and Sleep Regularity Index (SRI) was significantly lower in AD patients compared to controls (p = 0.004). Sex differences were also found: SE significantly lower in male AD compared to female AD subjects (p = 0.038) and SRI significantly lower in male AD subjects compared to male controls (p = 0.008), to male MCI (p = 0.047) but also to female AD subjects (p = 0.046). Regarding circadian indexes, mesor and rhythm quotient were significantly lower in males in the overall population, but not in the analysis for separate groups. The confusion-matrices showed a good predictive power of actigraphic data in forecasting the disease status with acceptable representativeness. Conclusions: Actigraphic data could help identify disease (AD or MCI) or health status. Sex (possibly gender) differences could have a relevant impact on neurodegeneration and disease trajectory with potential clinical applications. Disclosure: This multicenter study was conceived and promoted by the Italian Association of Sleep Medicine (AIMS) in close collaboration with the Italian Society for Dementia Research (SINdem) and coordinated by the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Neurology Unit, University of Pisa.

N2  - Objectives: Financial incentive programs are effective in increasing physical activity for overweight, ambulatory adults. We sought to determine the potential effect size and direction of financial incentives on ambulation after radical cystectomy. Materials and Methods: We performed a pilot randomized controlled trial of daily financial incentives to meet postoperative step goals among adults with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤2 who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer at a single center. Step counts were measured over a 3- to 14-day preoperative period and 30-day postoperative period using a wearable activity monitor. Postoperative daily step goals of 10%, 25%, 40%, and 55% of mean preoperative daily step counts were set for postoperative weeks 1 through 4, respectively. The primary outcome was the number of postoperative days on which the step goals were met. Secondary outcomes included the number of daily postoperative steps taken and the length of stay. Participants randomized to the intervention arm received $1.50 for every day the goal was met with a 20% chance of a $100 reward if the step goal was met on >75% of the first 30 postoperative days. Questionnaires assessing self-reported physical activity, disability, and social support were administered preoperatively at 30 days postoperatively. Results: Thirty-three patients were analyzed, 11 in the control and 22 in the intervention arms. There were no statistically significant differences between incentive and control arms for the primary outcome (4.5/30 days vs. 9/30 days, P = 0.53). Results after adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics were similar (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.24–4.19, P = 1.00). There were also no differences in average daily postoperative steps (median 979 vs. 1191, 95% CI −810 to 1,400, P = 0.59), length of stay (7.5 vs. 7, 95% CI −2.7 to 5.1, P = 0.56), or self-reported measures of disability, activity, and social support. Conclusions: While this trial was a pilot study and not powered to detect a difference between groups, there was no suggestion of any clinically important impact of this financial incentive on postoperative ambulation. While a fully-powered trial is feasible, given the small range of plausible benefit, such a trial would be unlikely to influence clinical practice.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the benefit of adding physical activity data, collected by an off-the-shelf wearable device, to other physiologic signals [i.e. injected insulin, carbohydrate intake, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) records] in an algorithm for prediction of future values of blood glucose (BG) for type 1 diabetes (T1D). Method: Experimental data were collected by six T1D subjects for five days during a clinical trial, where they wore a CGM sensor, an insulin pump and an activity tracker. We derived individualized linear predictors based on black-box models, using the prediction error method (PEM), the state-of-the-art identification technique, and the most general model parametrization (Box-Jenkins). First, we identified models using only meal and insulin information, and then using also the exercise information. The prediction accuracy of the two models, with or without physical activity, was compared with coefficient of determination (COD) and root mean squared error (RMSE). Result: The two models have similar performance for a short prediction horizon (PH) (up to 45 min): nevertheless, the inclusion of physical activity affects and improves the accuracy of longer PH. Indeed, the presence of physical activity improves the 3-hr prediction COD by mean ± standard deviation of 18.5% ± 30.1 % and the 3-hr prediction RMSE by mean ± standard deviation of 99.1 mg/dL ± 119.8 mg/dL. Conclusion: This preliminary investigation shows that the consideration of additional physiological information, like the physical exercise, improves the performance of models, leading to better predictions for longer PH.

N2  - The need to develop patient-specific interventions is apparent when one considers that clinical studies often report satisfactory motor gains only in a portion of participants. This observation provides the foundation for “precision rehabilitation”. Tracking and predicting outcomes defining the recovery trajectory is key in this context. Data collected using wearable sensors provide clinicians with the opportunity to do so with little burden on clinicians and patients. The approach proposed in this paper relies on machine learning-based algorithms to derive clinical score estimates from wearable sensor data collected during functional motor tasks. Sensor-based score estimates showed strong agreement with those generated by clinicians. Score estimates of upper-limb impairment severity and movement quality were marked by a coefficient of determination of 0.86 and 0.79, respectively. The application of the proposed approach to monitoring patients’ responsiveness to rehabilitation is expected to contribute to the development of patient-specific interventions, aiming to maximize motor gains.

N2  - Background: Low physical activity levels can negatively affect the health of nurses. Given the low physical activity levels reported by nurses, there is a clear need for brief and economical interventions designed to increase physical activity levels in this population. We developed a web-based intervention that used motivational strategies to increase nurses' physical activity levels. The intervention provided the nurses with feedback from an activity monitor coupled with a web-based individual, friend, or team physical activity challenge. Objective: In this parallel-group randomized trial, we examine whether nurses' motivation at baseline predicted changes in objectively measured physical activity levels during the 6-week intervention. Methods: The participants were 76 nurses (n=74, 97% female; mean age 46, SD 11 years) randomly assigned to 1 of 3 physical activity challenge conditions: (1) individual, (2) friend, or (3) team. The nurses completed a web-based questionnaire designed to assess motivational regulations for physical activity levels before the intervention and wore a Tractivity activity monitor before and during the 6-week intervention. We analyzed data using multilevel modeling for repeated measures. Results: The nurses' physical activity levels increased (linear estimate=10.30, SE 3.15; P=.001), but the rate of change decreased over time (quadratic estimate=−2.06, SE 0.52; P<.001). External and identified regulations (ß=−2.08 to 11.55; P=.02 to.04), but not intrinsic and introjected regulations (ß=−.91 to 6.29; P=.06 to.36), predicted changes in the nurses' physical activity levels. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence that an intervention that incorporates self-monitoring and physical activity challenges can be generally effective in increasing nurses' physical activity levels in the short term. They also suggest that drawing solely on organismic integration theory to predict changes in physical activity levels among the nurses participating in web-based worksite interventions may have been insufficient. Future research should examine additional personal (eg, self-efficacy) and occupational factors (eg, shift length and shift type) that influence physical activity levels to identify potential targets for intervention among nurses.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. RESULTS: The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

N2  - Wearable grip sensing shows potential for hand rehabilitation, but few studies have studied feasibility early after stroke. Here, we studied a wearable grip sensor integrated with a musical computer game (MusicGlove). Among the stroke patients admitted to a hospital without limiting complications, 13% had adequate hand function for system use. Eleven subjects used MusicGlove at home over three weeks with a goal of nine hours of use. On average they achieved 4.1 ± 3.2 (SD) hours of use and completed 8627 ± 7500 grips, an amount comparable to users in the chronic phase of stroke measured in a previous study. The rank-order usage data were well fit by distributions that arise in machine failure theory. Users operated the game at high success levels, achieving note-hitting success >75% for 84% of the 1061 songs played. They changed game parameters infrequently (31% of songs), but in a way that logically modulated challenge, consistent with the Challenge Point Hypothesis from motor learning. Thus, a therapy based on wearable grip sensing was feasible for home rehabilitation, but only for a fraction of subacute stroke subjects. Subjects made usage decisions consistent with theoretical models of machine failure and motor learning.

N2  - Background: There are many reports that subjective cognitive decline had a significantly higher risk of a progression to Alzheimer's disease and had a faster rate of neurodegeneration or cognitive decline than that of the control group. In addition, subjective cognitive decline showed more positive results in the biomarker tests of Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, it is necessary to find out the natural course of subjective cognitive decline and risk factors for converting to Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of this study is to identify which risk factors that can predict the progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia by constructing a cohort of elderly people who have normal cognitive function but have subjective cognitive decline. Methods: This cohort study is a prospective study aimed to enroll 120 people who aged 60 years or older presenting with a complaint of persistent cognitive decline in five different centers. In the neuropsychological test, subjects who are in the range of 7% to 50% of the memory domain and over 7% of the rest domains are included. All patients have graduated from elementary school or higher and agree to the participation of study in writing. Subjects who diagnosed dementia or mild cognitive impairment are not included. Those who have brain lesions and blood test abnormalities which affect a cognitive function are excluded in this study. Subjects who have severe uncontrolled depression, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and drug dependence are not included. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis of risk factors, protective factors, and initial clinical findings affecting cognitive decline including memory and cerebral neurodegeneration in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebral amyloid deposition in brain amyloid-beta Positron Emission Tomography (PET) will be performed. We plan to investigate a basic demographic information such as age, sex, education level, comorbid underlying disease, medication and family history through surveys. Apolipoprotein E genotype test and blood test which can affect in cognition will be done. Brain atrophy will be analyzed by visual rating and MRI volumetry using brain MRI. Blood-based amyloid quantification, a quantitative analysis of Electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological tests, subjective perception questionnaire surveys, and measuring physical activities using a wearable device are used to predict the possibility of a progression to mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's dementia. Balance test and gait analysis, pure tone test will be performed to evaluate the association with cognitive function. All tests are scheduled for baseline, one year and two years from baseline. Primary outcome is a progression to mild cognitive impairment and secondary outcome is a progression to Alzheimer's dementia. Discussion: The purpose of this study is to identify which risk factors that could be used to predict the progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia by constructing a prospective cohort of elderly people who have subjective cognitive decline. It can be expected that dementia or mild cognitive impairment can be prevented from the advance by controlling these risk factors.

N2  - Background: The World Health Organization has endorsed elimination of HCV by 2030. HCV treatment will need to be delivered to populations with limited healthcare system engagement compared to populations treated early after the advent of direct acting antivirals (DAA) This study aimed to determine the impact of a DMP on the efficacy of and adherence to DAAs in patients at risk for nonadherence Methods: This was a prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicenter study across 18 clinics in US adults initiating oral DAA treatment for chronic HCV. Patients were eligible if they were at risk for medication nonadherence (ex active alcohol/ substance abuse) Participants were required to have access to a phone and able to use a study-provided tablet with data connectivity Patients were treated using the Proteus Discover DMP (ingestible sensor co-encapsulated with DAA, wearable patch, patient mobile app, and provider web portal for realtime assessments of medication ingestion) The provider's office contacted patients if a dose was missing in the DMP. The population was assessed for the primary efficacy outcome, sustained virologic response at post-treatment weeks 4 and 12 (SVR4/12). Daily pill taking adherence was assessed by DMP Results: Overall, 288 participants were followed from August 2017-April 2019 [mean±SD age: 50±0.7 years; 67% male; African American (42%), Caucasian (39%) or Hispanic/ Latino (11%)] Most participants had a household income <$24,999 (68 4%); 9 4% self-reported as homeless Other baseline characteristics included psychiatric disorders (61%; of which 23% had a serious mental illness, 52% had alcohol/ substance abuse), HCV genotype (65% 1a, 13% 1b, 6% 2, 12% 3), past HCV treatment (8%), fibrosis stage (56% mild to severe, 11% cirrhosis), HIV co-infection (19%). DAA received was 19% velpatasvir/sofosbuvir, 26% ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, 55% glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. Table 1 reports SVR4/12 and ingestion adherence for 217 persons with data ≤14 weeks; 18 had SVR >14 weeks; 53 had no HCV outcomes available [30 were lost to follow up; 22 withdrew for other reasons, of which 6 were adverse event related (3 rash, 3 unrelated to DMP); 1 had missing SVR data]. Conclusion: In this study of DMP in a population at risk for nonadherence, 100% and 99 5% of all persons with an SVR4 and SVR12 assessment achieved SVR, respectively. Overall adherence rate was 93% with DMP monitoring Results suggest the DMP may be used to support adherence and optimize cure rates in difficult to treat HCV populations (Table Presented) .

N2  - Background: Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial did not demonstrate a significant reduction in arrhythmic death with the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD), but compliance with the device may have substantially affected the results. ThePletcher influence of WCD compliance on outcomes has not yet been fully evaluated. Methods: Using linear and pooled logistic models, we performed as-treated analyses omitting person-time in the hospital and adjusted for correlates of WCD compliance. To assess the impact of early stopping of WCD, we performed a per-protocol Kaplan-Meier analysis, censoring after the last day the WCD was worn. Interactions of potential effect modifiers with treatment assignment and WCD compliance on outcomes were investigated. Finally, we used linear models to identify predictors of WCD compliance. Results: A per-protocol analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in total (P <.001) and arrhythmic (P =.001) mortality. Better WCD compliance was independently predicted by cardiac arrest during index myocardial infarction (MI), higher Cr, diabetes, prior heart failure, EF ≤ 25%, Polish enrolling center and number of WCD alarms, while worse compliance was predicted by being divorced, Asian race, higher body mass index, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, or any WCD shock. Neither excluding time in hospital from the as-treated analysis nor adjustment for factors affecting WCD compliance materially changed the results. No variable demonstrated a significant interaction in either the intention-to-treat or as-treated analysis. Conclusion: Robust sensitivity analyses of as-treated and per-protocol analyses suggest that the WCD is protective in compliant patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% during the first 3 months post-MI.

N2  - Background: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. Conclusions: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested.

N2  - Background: Approximately three quarters of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Vietnam have used a phone or tablet to search for sexual health information online, and over half of these men have used it to locate nearby service providers. As HIV prevalence continues to rise in Vietnamese MSM, smartphones and other electronic media may provide an ideal platform for HIV research and intervention. Here, we describe a pilot study of an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) application (app) and a wearable device (MC10 BioStamp) to monitor risk-taking behaviours and mental health symptomatology and assess the feasibility and acceptability of the app, and mobile health (mHealth) needs of MSM in Vietnam. Methods: We recruited 50 participants from outpatient clinics and community-based organisations for MSM in Hanoi, Vietnam. For 1 week, participants completed brief surveys on their smartphone at six to eight random time-points every day. At each time-point, participants answered questions assessing: current mood; stress level; qualities of their current environment (including who they were with); mental health symptoms since last notification; risk behaviours; and GPS location (automatically recorded). They additionally wore two sensors on their chest and thigh, monitoring ambulatory heart rate and physical activity. After the week, participants were interviewed about their experiences using the application and were asked survey questions about what features they wanted in future mHealth-related apps. Findings: Participants were identified from an existing dataset of MSM (n=198) and invited to return for the study between January and April 2019. Overall, participants reported few issues with the sensors; however, they had more concerns about the app. The most frequent complaints participants had were that the assessments were too repetitive, too frequent, and did not provide enough opportunity for in-depth qualitative responses. What participants most enjoyed about the app was that it provided an opportunity to share and to reflect on their moods and social interactions. To improve, participants felt the messaging needed to be more MSM-friendly and visually appealing, while providing occasional statistics on their weekly moods or behaviours. The most popular app features desired were the ability to talk directly to a service provider about ongoing health concerns (91%; 40/44), locate nearby PrEP providers (82%; 36/44), and locate a nearby HIV/STD testing centre (82%; 36/44). Interpretation: This study found that mobile EMA apps and wearable technology are a feasible and acceptable way of monitoring mental distress and HIV risk among MSM in Vietnam. Given that many were already looking towards the app as a means to self-manage and acquire more health-related information, mobile technologies may be a natural platform for bridging research and intervention among this population.

N2  - Purpose: So far, only generalized tonic-clonic seizures can be reliably detected with non-invasive wearable devices. However, studies suggest heart-rate variability (HRV) could be suitable for also detecting focal seizures. We aimed to develop an automated seizure detection algorithm using a wearable ECG-device for detecting both GTC and focal seizures. Method: We recorded ECG using a dedicated wearable device (ePatch ®) during long-term video-EEG monitoring. In this phase-2 clinical study, 100 patients were prospectively recruited; 43 of the patients had a total of 126 seizures (111 focal, 15 GTC) of > 20 seconds duration during recording (941 h of training data, 2,238 h of test data). We analyzed 10 HRV-parameters using both 50 and 100 R-R intervals sliding window with maximum overlapping. Each HRV-parameters cut-off value for seizure-alarm was set to 105% of the highest non-seizure period during training data of the same patient. The four best parameters in terms of seizure detection were identified and combined in pairs (all combinations) creating an additional six parameters for seizure detection analysis. Positive responders of seizure detection were defined, for each HRV-parameter, as patients with > 66% of seizures detected. Results: In total, 53.5% of the patients were responders for the best performing algorithm. In these patients, the method achieved a sensitivity of 93.1% and false detection rate of 1.1/day. An average of > 50 beats/minute HR increase or decrease during seizure(s) is a positive predictor of being a responder of seizure detection (sensitivity: 90.9%, specificity: 87.0%), making it easy to define for which patients a reliable seizure alarm is feasible. Conclusion: Automated seizure detection based on HRV was feasible in more than half of the patients. High sensitivity and low false positive alarm rates can be achieved with an algorithm analyzing ECG signals using the wearable device in persons with HR changes > 50 beats/minute during seizures.

N2  - Background The Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial (VEST) showed a trend toward decreased sudden death and lower overall mortality with a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) in the immediate post-myocardial infarction (MI) period. We sought to identify which patients are most likely to benefit from a WCD by identifying risk factors that predict appropriate shock in the VEST cohort. Methods The WCD arm of the VEST trial followed 1,524 participants with acute MI and ejection fraction ≤35% for 90 days after hospitalization, of whom 20 received at least 1 appropriate shock. We examined this population for the association of any appropriate shock event to 8 risk factors shown to predict arrhythmic mortality in previous combined analysis of multicenter trials: 1) Age, 2) Male sex, 3) Previous MI, 4) Previous hypertension, 5) Previous angina, 6) Elevated systolic blood pressure, 7) Elevated heart rate, and 8) NYHA Class. Covariates associated with shock in unadjusted analysis were included in an adjusted logistic model. Results In unadjusted analysis, previous hypertension was associated with reduced odds (OR 0.35, p=0.02) and higher baseline heart rate with increased odds (OR 1.18 per 10 bpm, p=0.045) of any appropriate shock. In an adjusted logistic model, both hypertension (OR 0.34, p=0.02) and heart rate (per 10 bpm, OR 1.18, p=0.04) independently predicted any appropriate shock. However, the C-statistic for this model was only 0.70. Conclusion In patients with low ejection fraction following acute MI, those without a history of hypertension and/or with elevated heart rates are more likely to have ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), needing an appropriate shock from a WCD in the 90 days after hospital discharge. Clinicians should consider targeting these patients for a WCD, as they may derive the most benefit.

N2  - Background and Aims: ARISES (Adaptive, Real-time, Intelligent Systemto Enhance Self-care of chronic disease) is amobile platform facilitating a decision support system for people with Type 1 diabetes (T1D). This project aims to improve the efficacy of current care and reduce the burden of managing diabetes in daily living. We incorporate wearable biosensors and leverage on-device machine learning techniques towards improving glucose control. Methods: This work details the system architecture for ARISES. ARISES comprises inputs from a Dexcom G6 for CGM, and Empatica E4 for physiological signals. These data are wirelessly transmitted to the smartphone. These data are then input to machine learning models which provide insights on the future glucose trajectory by means of a dilated recurrent neural network algorithm, and detect external contributing factors - exercise and stress. The second component is an insulin recommendation algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning that, using insights and historical data, provides bolus advice. Results: We developed the platform on Apple iOS and implemented it on an iPhone. The built-in algorithm has been in silico validated and evaluated with retrospective clinical data. The performance of the platform will be evaluated in a randomised cross-over clinical study with 12 participants over 8 weeks. Conclusions: The ARISES platform represents a step forward in decision support systems for T1D management due to the wealth of collected physiological data and the use of state-of-theart machine learning algorithms.

N2  - Background:Mild neurocognitive disorder (mNCD) is one of the degenerative diseases that results in memory deficit, and can progress to dementia. The effectiveness of drug therapy for mNCD is still debatable, but treatment of this disease has important implications for postponing or preventing dementia. Jujadokseo-hwan (JDH) is a traditional herbal medicine formulation that exhibits improvement in cognitive abilities and neuroprotective effects. In this study, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of JDH compared to placebo in mNCD patients.Methods and design:This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial. After obtaining informed consent from all participants and performing the screening process, the participants will be equally divided into an experimental group and a control group. Each participant will visit the trial center 7 times during the 12 weeks of intervention. The follow up study will be conducted 12 weeks after the intervention ends. The primary outcome is the variance in Seoul verbal learning test-elderly's version (SVLT-E) score from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes include scores/values for the following variables: SVLT-E, Rey complex figure test, Digit span test, Korean-Boston naming test, calculation ability, controlled oral word association test, Korean-color word stroop test, digit symbol coding, Korean-trail making test-elderly's version, Korean version of mini mental state examination for dementia screening, euro-qol-5 dimension, pattern identifications tool for cognitive disorders, Korean version of Montreal cognitive assessment, Korean quality of life-Alzheimer disease, computerized tongue image analysis system, blood pressure pulse analyzer, bioelectrical impedance analyzer, wearable electroencephalogram device, functional near-infrared spectroscopy system, and cost analysis.Discussion:This is the first trial evaluating the efficacy of JDH for mNCD. We expect this trial will provide strong support for wide use of JDH for mNCD and lead to further research on herbal medicine treatments for mNCD.Trial registration number:KCT0003570 (Registered in Clinical Research Information Service of the Republic of Korea, https://cris.nih.go.kr/cris/search/search-result-st01.jsp?seq=12669).

N2  - Introduction: Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is an exercise-based program prescribed after cardiac events that is associated with improved physical, mental, and social functioning; however, as few as 15-50% of patients report any exercise 6 months after CR. Physical activity (PA) is critical to avoid recurrence of cardiac events and mortality as well as maintaining functional capacity after completing Phase II CR. Leveraging digital heath strategies to increase adherence to PA is a promising approach. Our aim was to determine whether engagement with the MOVN mobile application (app) and a Fitbit wearable activity tracker would improve step counts over 2 months after CR. The primary objective of this pilot randomized controlled trial was to establish an effect size for average daily step counts between study arms. Methods: We randomized patients 1:1 to the intervention or control group. The intervention group used the MOVN app (for PA self-management and to receive messages on motivation and education on secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease) and wore a Fitbit Charge 2 to track daily steps. Participants in the usual care group wore a pedometer and recorded their daily steps in a diary. Data from the self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 2 months. We conducted a t-test and Cohen's d calculation to determine any differences between groups on the primary outcome of average daily step counts and effect size over 2 months, respectively. Results: We recruited 60 patients from 2 CR sites of a community hospital in Northern California. The mean age was 66.8 ± 8.6 and 22% were female; retention rate was 85%. Over 2 months, the intervention group had approximately 2,100 more steps per day than the control group (8,832 ± 3,408 vs. 6,747 ± 3,990; P=0.051 ; Cohen's d=0.54), but this study was not powered to detect significant differences. Conclusions: Our digital health intervention presents a promising, pragmatic approach to promote PA maintenance after CR. Future research is needed to test the efficacy of this intervention as a full-scale clinical trial. This intervention addresses a major public health initiative to promote PA in patients with CVD with the potential to improve critical PA, clinical, and psychosocial outcomes.

N2  - Introduction: Early detection of silent atrial fibrillation (AF) followed by adequate intervention facilitates to prevent stroke and other adverse cardiovascular events. MybeatTM is a cutaneous patch type new device that continuously records electrocardiography for up to 5 days and automatically analyses using new algorithm based on RR intervals. (Figure 1) Hypothesis: We hypothesized that this novel device could detect silent AF in asymptomatic patients with known risk factors. Methods: We conducted a multicenter randomized study and tested the diagnostic utility of this novel device in screening silent AF. Inclusion criteria were ≥65 years and ≥1 of the following risk factors: hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. We excluded patients with prior AF, implantable pacemaker, and previous palpitation or syncope. Thus, we enrolled 300 participants and divided them into group using MybeatTM wearable device (Mybeat group, N=150) or group underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring (control group, N=150) for screening AF. AF was defined using particular algorithm based on the heartbeat fluctuation and was confirmed by the 2 weeks Holter electrocardiogram. (Figure 2) Results: There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. (Table1) In the Mybeat group, the ratio of AF detection was significantly higher than that of control group (Mybeat vs. control, 16[10.7%] vs. 7[4.7%]; P=0.04). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that prior heart failure was independent predictor of silent AF (Table 2, OR 5.33; 95%CI 1.21-48.56; P=0.01). We observed a 10.5-fold difference in silent AF between an individual with 1 point and ≥4-point CHADs2-Vasc scores. Conclusions: The novel patch type device using original algorithm was useful for screening of silent AF.

N2  - Introduction Neutropenic fever following high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a common (incidence 63-100%) and potentially life-threatening complication. Recommended time to antibiotic (TTA) administration is within 1 hr of fever onset with delays associated with significant morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and mortality. Standard of care guidelines emphasize patient self-monitoring for fever, with instructions to seek immediate medical attention if body temperature (temp) reaches 100.4°F or higher. In this study, we evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temp monitor, tPatch, could reliably estimate core body temp and detect fever in an outpatient setting following ASCT. Additionally, we gathered preliminary data to explore early detection and prediction of clinically relevant temp rise in this clinical setting. Methods Patients (N = 86) with hematologic malignancies (62% multiple myeloma) who underwent high-dose chemotherapy followed by ASCT at Mayo Clinic, MN were prospectively enrolled between June 2018 and March 2019. Patients (82% male) wore an axilla-placed tPatch continuously for 7 days in an outpatient setting during the post ASCT period and were asked to record self-measured oral temp in 3-4 hr intervals daily using a standardized thermometer after appropriate training . Patients followed standard of care procedures with daily clinic assessment of temp, blood counts, and vital signs. An optional patient questionnaire was given at end-of-study. A model was trained using both patientand clinic-assessed oral temp measures to estimate core temp from 2 sensors on the tPatch device. Core temp estimates and trends were then compared to patient- and clinic-assessed measurements. Fever was defined as a temperature ≥100.4°F for at least 1 hr. Results When compared to all oral temp reads, the tPatch estimated core temp within 0.03 ± 0.7°F. Among the 86 patients, clinic-assessed fever incidence was 29.4% while tPatch-assessed incidence was 58.8%. Using all clinic-recorded temp readings as “ground truth,” the sensitivity and specificity of the tPatch algorithm in detecting fevers were 88% and 86%, respectively, while patient self fever detection sensitivity was 62% and specificity 93%. With “fever episode” defined as a temp ≥100.4°F for at least 1 hr, tPatch detected 9.6 times the number of fever episodes vs. clinic reads. The average lead time of tPatch detection of clinic-recorded fevers was 3.7 hours. In 25% of all intervals between clinic temp readings, either tPatch or patients detected at least 1 fever episode. The tPatch was well-tolerated, the only adverse events reported were grade 1 skin irritation and discomfort in 4 (5%) patients. Of 65 patients who completed the survey, 95% reported the tPatch as “quite” or “somewhat” comfortable and 94% stated no difficulty in using the tPatch. Exploration of tPatch temp trends over various time intervals for use in fever prediction is ongoing. Conclusions Patient self-monitoring of temp has low sensitivity and is not feasible for long intervals of time (e.g., overnight). Continuous temperature monitoring by a wearable device overcomes these challenges and has the potential to improve early detection and consequently shorten time to antibiotic initiation. A follow-up randomized study is planned to assess the clinical benefits of continuous temp monitoring through patient and clinician alerts triggering early clinical intervention for febrile neutropenia.

N2  - Background: The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) has been shown to be useful during transient periods of high sudden cardiac death risk, and the issue of compliance recently pointed out. This Registry was designed to provide real-world data on WCD use in France, in terms of compliance, potential adverse events, as well as efficacy. Methods and results: Multicenter evaluation (WEARIT FRANCE Registry) was conducted in France between January 2017 and March 2018. Overall, 1,157 patients were analyzed: 950 with ischemic heart disease (82%, including 647 patients after myocardial infarction), 119 after ICD explant (10%), and 88 pre-transplant (8%). The median age was 61 years; the median ejection fraction was 25%. Median WCD wear time was 62 days, with median daily use of 23.4 hours. Less than 1% of patients did not wear WCD at least 4 hours per day. During follow-up, a total of 42 sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT/VF) occurred in 36 patients, of whom 50% (n=18) received appropriate WCD shocks, giving an incidence of appropriate therapy of 1.56%. The rate of all VT/VF episodes were 3.1% among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=29/950) versus 3.4% for the others (n=7/207). Of the ischemic patients wearing beyond 30 days (N=784), 5 received appropriate therapy of VT/VF episodes. Overall shock survival was 100%. At the end of the WCD period, 586 patients (51%) were implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Eight patients (0.69%) received inappropriate WCD shocks. Regarding the apparent very low proportion of women considered for WCD therapy, we aimed to appreciate in which extent Conclusions: In this multicenter nationwide WCD evaluation, 3.1% of patients presented with sustained VT/VF with 47% of those patients developing VT/VF after 30 days. The incidence of inappropriate therapy was low. The compliance to WCD in this real life evaluation was very high. These data suggest that the WCD, when worn appropriately, may be helpful in the arsenal to protect high-risk patients against SCD, especially in case of transient risk situations.

N2  - BACKGROUND Optical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses. The ability of a smartwatch application (app) to identify atrial fibrillation during typical use is unknown. METHODS Participants without atrial fibrillation (as reported by the participants themselves) used a smartphone (Apple iPhone) app to consent to monitoring. If a smartwatchbased irregular pulse notification algorithm identified possible atrial fibrillation, a telemedicine visit was initiated and an electrocardiography (ECG) patch was mailed to the participant, to be worn for up to 7 days. Surveys were administered 90 days after notification of the irregular pulse and at the end of the study. The main objectives were to estimate the proportion of notified participants with atrial fibrillation shown on an ECG patch and the positive predictive value of irregular pulse intervals with a targeted confidence interval width of 0.10. RESULTS We recruited 419,297 participants over 8 months. Over a median of 117 days of monitoring, 2161 participants (0.52%) received notifications of irregular pulse. Among the 450 participants who returned ECG patches containing data that could be analyzed which had been applied, on average, 13 days after notification atrial fibrillation was present in 34% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 39) overall and in 35% (97.5% CI, 27 to 43) of participants 65 years of age or older. Among participants who were notified of an irregular pulse, the positive predictive value was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.92) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular pulse notification and 0.71 (97.5% CI, 0.69 to 0.74) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular tachogram. Of 1376 notified participants who returned a 90-day survey, 57% contacted health care providers outside the study. There were no reports of serious app-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS The probability of receiving an irregular pulse notification was low. Among participants who received notification of an irregular pulse, 34% had atrial fibrillation on subsequent ECG patch readings and 84% of notifications were concordant with atrial fibrillation. This siteless (no on-site visits were required for the participants), pragmatic study design provides a foundation for large-scale pragmatic studies in which outcomes or adherence can be reliably assessed with user-owned devices.

N2  - Purpose: Here we explore the prognostic value of baseline step count data captured using wearable devices for patients treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods and Materials: Patients with locally advanced NSCLC wore a commercial fitness tracker during a course of definitive, concurrent chemoradiation therapy as part of a clinical trial. Baseline step count average was defined as the average daily step total from study enrollment until completion of the first week of radiation therapy. Based on data from healthy individuals, study subjects were categorized as inactive (below the 25th percentile), moderately active (25th to 75th percentile), or highly active (above the 75th percentile). Fisher's exact test was used to examine activity level as a predictor of hospitalization during radiation therapy and of completing the planned radiation therapy course without delay exceeding 1 week. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) durations were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Inactivity was tested as a predictor of PFS and OS using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Fifty subjects met eligibility criteria. Nine (18%) were categorized as highly active, 23 (46%) were moderately active, and 18 (36%) were inactive. Inactive subjects were more likely to be hospitalized during the radiation therapy course than other subjects (50% vs 9%, P = .004) and less likely to complete radiation therapy without delay exceeding 1 week (67% vs 97%, P = .006). Median PFS duration was 5.3 months for inactive subjects and 18.3 months for others (hazard ratio for inactivity = 5.10, P < .001). Median OS duration was 15.0 months for inactive subjects and not reached for others (hazard ratio = 3.91, P = .004). Performance status was not a significant predictor of PFS or OS. Conclusions: Baseline activity level measured using wearable devices may help identify patients with NSCLC who are fit for concurrent chemoradiation therapy and can predict clinical outcomes in this setting.

N2  - Background: Behavioral and Environmental Sensing and Intervention for Dementia Caregiver Empowerment (BESI) is a system of body-worn and in-home sensors developed to provide continuous, non-invasive agitation assessment and environmental context monitoring to detect early signals of agitation and environmental triggers. The goal to detect early stages of agitation in persons with dementia (PWD) opens up new and promising technological development of cyber-human systems to enable early caregiver intervention. Caregivers shoulder most of the burden of dementia caregiving, and the BESI project seeks to reduce burden and improve caregiver self-efficacy. Methods: This mixed methods, remote ethnographic study is explored in a 3-phase, multi-year plan. In Phase 1 we developed the BESI system, completed usability studies in Alzheimer's Disease support groups using the Systems Usability Scale (SUS), and refined the system. Dyads (caregivers + PWD) who live at home are studied for 30 days in Phase 2 with continuous data collection during the deployment period. A tablet application for caregivers is used to log PWD activities, agitation events, and input markers of caregiver self-efficacy. Using wearable wrist technology (e.g. Pebble®), agitation severity level, physical, behavioral, and social activities of the PWD are captured. Post-deployment surveys of all ten dyads provided data on the system usability from questions posed with Likert-type scaling response ratings between 1 and 6 plus qualitative feedback. Results: Between phases 1 & 2, the tablet application was updated to enhance interface usability for caregivers. Scores for the ten questions (rated 1-6) on ease of use of the tablet were in the very easy range (5.11 - 5.90). Agreement on use of the table device yielded SUS scores (rated 1-5) with range of 2.67 - 4.56. Preliminary analysis of the subjective feedback indicates overall positive impressions in working with the technologies. Conclusions: Phase 2 results facilitated targeted changes in BESI, improving overall usability for the final phase of the study. Caregivers consistently demonstrated willingness to help – including working with technologies previously unfamiliar. These subject-oriented design decisions influenced the team in understanding caregiver and PWD dyad interactions with technologies. The full qualitative report will be available in June 2019.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Construction work frequently involves heavy physical work, and a reduction of the physical workload should have high priority. Technological development has made it possible to obtain field measurements with surface electromyography (sEMG), kinematics measured with inertial measurement units (IMUs), and video recordings. However, no studies have used these methods simultaneously to detect situations with excessive physical workload (events) during a working day. Thus, knowledge about these specific events may combat work-related risk factors. Participatory ergonomics (PE) has shown promising results, but whether it can be used as a tool to reduce the physical workload during construction work remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This cluster randomized controlled trial investigated whether a PE intervention with technical measurements consisting of IMUs, sEMG, heart rate monitoring, and video recordings of physical workload could reduce the number of events with excessive physical workload during a working day. Furthermore, other outcomes were obtained from questionnaires. METHODS: A total of 80 male full-time construction workers (aged 19 to 67 years) were randomized at the cluster level (gang) to a PE intervention consisting of 3 workshops (7 gangs and 32 workers) or to a control group (8 gangs and 48 workers). The physical workload was recorded by technical measurements, that is, IMUs, sEMG, heart rate monitoring, and video recordings during a full working day at baseline and 3 and 6 months' follow-up. On the basis of the technical measurements, a custom-made computer program detected the situations (events) where the construction workers were exposed to excessive physical workload and used in the intervention. Differences in the number of events from baseline to follow-up between intervention and control were evaluated using linear mixed models (intention-to-treat), with individual nested in cluster as a random factor. Furthermore, questionnaires were filled out on test days. RESULTS: The results of the primary outcome showed no change in the number of events with excessive physical workload. However, compared with the control group, the other outcomes showed decreased general fatigue after a typical working day (P=.001) and increased influence on own work (P=.04). CONCLUSIONS: This PE intervention with technical measurements did not reduce the number of events with excessive physical workload during construction work. However, the intervention led to decreased general fatigue and increased influence on own work.

N2  - Pioneering advances have been made in Internet of Things technologies (IoT) in healthcare. This article describes the development and testing of a bespoke IoT system for dementia care. Technology integrated health management (TIHM) for dementia is part of the NHS England National Test Bed Programme and has involved trailing the deployment of network enabled devices combined with artificial intelligence to improve outcomes for people with dementia and their carers. TIHM uses machine learning and complex algorithms to detect and predict early signs of ill health. The premise is if changes in a person's health or routine can be identified early on, support can be targeted at the point of need to prevent the development of more serious complications.

N2  - Objective To validate whether a wearable remote vital signs monitor could accurately measure heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR) and temperature in a postsurgical patient population at high risk of complications. Design Manually recorded vital signs data were paired with vital signs data derived from the remote monitor set in patients participating in the Trial of Remote versus Continuous INtermittent monitoring (TRaCINg) study: a trial of continuous remote vital signs monitoring. Setting St James's University Hospital, UK. Participants 51 patients who had undergone major elective general surgery. Interventions The intervention was the SensiumVitals monitoring system. This is a wireless patch worn on the patient's chest that measures HR, RR and temperature continuously. The reference standard was nurse-measured manually recorded vital signs. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcomes were the 95% limits of agreement between manually recorded and wearable patch vital sign recordings of HR, RR and temperature. The secondary outcomes were the percentage completeness of vital sign patch data for each vital sign. Results 1135 nurse observations were available for analysis. There was no clinically meaningful bias in HR (1.85 bpm), but precision was poor (95% limits of agreement -23.92 to 20.22 bpm). Agreement was poor for RR (bias 2.93 breaths per minute, 95% limits of agreement -8.19 to 14.05 breaths per minute) and temperature (bias 0.82°C, 95% limits of agreement -1.13°C to 2.78°C). Vital sign patch data completeness was 72.8% for temperature, 59.2% for HR and 34.1% for RR. Distributions of RR in manually recorded measurements were clinically implausible. Conclusions The continuous monitoring system did not reliably provide HR consistent with nurse measurements. The accuracy of RR and temperature was outside of acceptable limits. Limitations of the system could potentially be overcome through better signal processing. While acknowledging the time pressures placed on nursing staff, inaccuracies in the manually recorded data present an opportunity to increase awareness about the importance of manual observations, particularly with regard to methods of manual HR and RR measurements.

N2  - There have always been practical demands for objective and accurate assessment of muscle spasticity beyond its clinical routine. A novel regression-based framework for quantitative assessment of muscle spasticity is proposed in this paper using wearable surface electromyogram (EMG) and inertial sensors combined with a simple examination procedure. Sixteen subjects with elbow flexor or extensor (i.e., biceps brachii muscle or triceps brachii muscle) spasticity and eight healthy subjects were recruited for the study. The EMG and inertial data were recorded from each subject when a series of passive elbow stretches with different stretch velocities were conducted. In the proposed framework, both lambda model and kinematic model were constructed from the recorded data, and biomarkers were extracted respectively from the two models to describe the neurogenic component and biomechanical component of the muscle spasticity, respectively. Subsequently, three evaluation methods using supervised machine learning algorithms including single-/multi-variable linear regression and support vector regression (SVR) were applied to calibrate biomarkers from each single model or combination of two models into evaluation scores. Each of these evaluation scores can be regarded as a prediction of the modified Ashworth scale (MAS) grade for spasticity assessment with the same meaning and clinical interpretation. In order to validate performance of three proposed methods within the framework, a 24-fold leave-one-out cross validation was conducted for all subjects. Both methods with each individual model achieved satisfactory performance, with low mean square error (MSE, 0.14 and 0.47) between the resultant evaluation score and the MAS. By contrast, the method using SVR to fuse biomarkers from both models outperformed other two methods with the lowest MSE at 0.059. The experimental results demonstrated the usability and feasibility of the proposed framework, and it provides an objective, quantitative and convenient solution to spasticity assessment, suitable for clinical, community, and home-based rehabilitation.

N2  - Background: Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly. A critical limitation is that they use data collected up until the time of discharge but do not leverage information on patient behaviors at home after discharge. Methods: PREDICT is a two-arm, randomized trial comparing ways to use remotely-monitored patient activity levels after hospital discharge to improve hospital readmission prediction models. Patients are randomly assigned to use a wearable device or smartphone application to track physical activity data. The study collects also validated assessments on patient characteristics as well as disparate data on credit scores and medication adherence. Patients are followed for 6 months. We evaluate whether these data sources can improve prediction compared to standard modelling approaches. Conclusion: The PREDICT Trial tests a novel method of remotely-monitoring patient behaviors after hospital discharge. Findings from the trial could inform new ways to improve the identification of patients at high-risk for hospital readmission. Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02983812

N2  - Objective: The objective of this study was to ascertain whether wearable technology coupled with action planning was effective in increasing physical activity (PA) in colorectal and endometrial cancer survivors at cardiovascular risk. Methods: Sixty-eight survivors who had cardiovascular risk factors and were insufficiently active were randomized to intervention and control arms. Intervention participants were given a wearable tracker for 12 weeks, two group sessions, and a support phone call. Participants in the control arm received print materials describing PA guidelines. Assessments at baseline and 12 weeks measured triaxial and uniaxial estimates of moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary behaviour, blood pressure, and body mass index (BMI). Results: The intervention group significantly increased MVPA by 45 min/wk compared with a reduction of 21 min/wk in the control group. Group by time interactions were significant for minutes of MVPA (F1,126 = 5.14, P = 0.025). For those with diastolic hypertension, there was a significant group by time interaction (F1,66 = 4.89, P = 0.031) with a net reduction of 9.89 mm Hg in the intervention group. Conclusions: Significant improvements in MVPA were observed following the intervention. The results display promise for the use of pragmatic, low-intensity interventions using wearable technology.

N2  - Introduction Physically active cancer survivors have substantially less cancer recurrence and improved survival compared with those who are inactive. However, the majority of survivors (70%-90%) are not meeting the physical activity (PA) guidelines. There are also significant geographic inequalities in cancer survival with poorer survival rates for the third of Australians who live in non-metropolitan areas compared with those living in major cities. The primary objective of the trial is to increase moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) among cancer survivors living in regional and remote Western Australia. Secondary objectives are to reduce sedentary behaviour and in conjunction with increased PA, improve quality of life (QoL) in non-metropolitan survivors. Tertiary objectives are to assess the effectiveness of the health action process approach (HAPA) model variables, on which the intervention is based, to predict change in MVPA. Methods and analysis Eighty-six cancer survivors will be randomised into either the intervention or control group. Intervention group participants will receive a Fitbit and up to six telephone health-coaching sessions. MVPA (using Actigraph), QoL and psychological variables (based on the HAPA model via questionnaire) will be assessed at baseline, 12 weeks (end of intervention) and 24 weeks (end of follow-up). A general linear mixed model will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been obtained from St John of God Hospital Subiaco (HREC/#1201). We plan to submit a manuscript of the results to a peer-reviewed journal. Results will be presented at conferences, community and consumer forums and hospital research conferences.

N2  - Background: Up to a third of patients with diabetes are undiagnosed, and therefore go untreated. Widely available consumer technologies could detect diabetes at an early stage. Since diabetes is associated with vascular changes, we examined whether diabetes could be detected using only the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, a measurement readily obtained from smartphones and wearable devices, using a convolution neural network (CNN). Methods: We studied 22,298 individuals enrolled in the Health eHeart Study, an IRB-approved UCSF study, who used the Azumio smartphone app. Users were randomly divided into separate training (70%), development (10%), and test (20%) datasets. We fit a 34-layer CNN using the training dataset to predict self-reported prevalent diabetes. The development dataset was used for model tuning, and model discrimination was measured using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the test dataset. Results: The mean age was 47.0 ± 14.0 years, 69% were male and 1,331 (6.0%) had diabetes. Of 1,440,000 PPG measurements that were utilized, 101,455 (7.0%) were derived from diabetic participants. The AUC for predicting prevalent diabetes in the test dataset was 0.772 (95% CI 0.747 - 0.797). Conclusion: We demonstrate that deep learning can be used to detect prevalent diabetes from the PPG signal alone with reasonable discrimination. This study constitutes the first proof-of-concept demonstration that smartphone-based PPG can be used for diabetes detection. [Figure presented]

N2  - Introduction: Frequent premature beats may significantly increase the risk of heart failure and death by inducing arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy. Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most important and convenient diagnostic tool for heart diseases, but the heart disease patient’s ECG is very complex and needs an experienced cardiologist to interpret correctly. In this research, we studied the detection of PVC using recurrent neural networks with ECG big data obtained by wearable medical devices used by non-cardiologists. Through the validation with MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, we obtained an accuracy of 95-99%. Methods: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) is used to learn feature representation of ECG signals. We treat the ECG signal as 1D sequences each including 3 heart beats. Then we build a 5-layer RNN mainly including a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer, and two fully-connected layers. The RNN is trained by 16259 training sequences and tested by 500 randomly selected testing sequences. Results: The detection performance is evaluated by three standard metrics: accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we obtained an average accuracy of 95%-99%, a sensitivity of 99%-100%, and a specificity of 94%-96%. Discussion and Conclusion: In this research, we have implemented a fully automated PVC detection method based on RNN and got excellent detection accuracies for different patients by using the same neural networks. This system may assist physicians to interpret ECG for the diagnosis of arrhythmias. In addition, RNN may also be used for online PVC detection from ECG measured by wearable medical devices to promote the healthcare of human beings in casual life.

This Registry was designed to provide realworld data on WCD use in France, in terms of compliance, potential adverse events, as well as efficacy. Methods: Multicenter evaluation (WEARIT FRANCE Registry) was conducted in France between January 2017 and March 2018. Overall, 1013 patients with complete data sets were analyzed: 834 with ischemic heart disease (82%, including 577 patients after myocardial infarction), 111 after ICD explant (11%), and 68 pre-transplant (7%). The median age was 61 years; the median ejection fraction was 25.4%. Results: Median WCD wear time was 61 days, with median daily use of 23.4 hours. Less than 1% of patients did not wear WCD at least 4 hours per day. During follow-up, a total of 35 sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT/VF) occurred in 30 patients, of whom 56.7% (n=17) received appropriate WCD shocks, giving an incidence of appropriate therapy of 1.7%. The rate of all VT/VF episodes were 2.9% among patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=24/834) versus 3.3% for the others (n=6/179). Of the ischemic patients wearing beyond 30 days (N=657), 7 received appropriate therapy. Overall shock survival was 100%. Supra-ventricular tachycardia occurred in 6 patients. At the end of the WCD period, 564 patients (55.7%) were implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Among the patients who had an ejection fraction below 35% at baseline, and were not implanted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (N=416), 351 (82%) had an improvement in ejection fraction to >35%. Five patients (0.49%) received inappropriate WCD shocks. Conclusions: In this multicenter nationwide WCD evaluation, 3% of patients presented with sustained VT/VF with 40% of those patients developing VT/VF after 30 days. The incidence of inappropriate therapy was low. These data suggest that the WCD, when worn appropriately, may be helpful in the arsenal to protect high-risk patients against SCD, especially in case of transient risk situations.

N2  - Objectives: The WATCH AF (SmartWATCHes for Detection of Atrial Fibrillation) trial compared the diagnostic accuracy to detect atrial fibrillation (AF) by a smartwatch-based algorithm using photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals with cardiologists’ diagnosis by electrocardiography (ECG). Background: Timely detection of AF is crucial for stroke prevention. Methods: In this prospective, 2-center, case-control trial, a PPG pulse wave recording using a commercially available smartwatch was obtained along with Internet-enabled mobile ECG in 672 hospitalized subjects. PPG recordings were analyzed by a novel automated algorithm. Cardiologists’ diagnoses were available for 650 subjects, although 142 (21.8%) datasets were not suitable for PPG analysis, among them 101 (15.1%) that were also not interpretable by the automated Internet-enabled mobile ECG algorithm, resulting in a sample size of 508 subjects (mean age 76.4 years, 225 women, 237 with AF) for the main analyses. Results: For the PPG algorithm, we found a sensitivity of 93.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 89.8% to 96.4%), a specificity of 98.2% (95% CI: 95.8% to 99.4%), and 96.1% accuracy (95% CI: 94.0% to 97.5%) to detect AF. Conclusions: The results of the WATCH AF trial suggest that detection of AF using a commercially available smartwatch is in principle feasible, with very high diagnostic accuracy. Applicability of the tested algorithm is currently limited by a high dropout rate as a result of insufficient signal quality. Thus, achieving sufficient signal quality remains challenging, but real-time signal quality checks are expected to improve signal quality. Whether smartwatches may be useful complementary tools for convenient long-term AF screening in selected at-risk patients must be evaluated in larger population-based samples.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Wearable devices based on inertial measurement units through wireless sensor networks have many applications such as real-time motion monitoring and functional outcome assessment of stroke rehabilitation. However, additional investigations are warranted to validate their clinical value, particularly in detecting the synergy patterns of movements after stroke. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and efficacy of wearable devices for upper limb rehabilitation in patients with chronic stroke and to compare the intervention effects (e.g., neurological recovery, active range of motion, and deviation angle) with those in a control group. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized-controlled pilot study. SETTING: Rehabilitation ward. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with chronic stroke were randomly distributed into a device group and control group. Both groups received conventional rehabilitation; nevertheless, the device group was additionally subjected to 15 daily sessions at least three times a week for 5 weeks. The outcome measures included the upper extremity subscores of the Fugl-Meyer assessment, active range of motion, and deviation angle. These measurements were performed pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: All five Fugl-Meyer assessment subscores improved in both the device and control groups after intervention; in particular, the "shoulder/elbow/forearm" subscore (P=0.02, 0.03) and "total score" (P=0.03, 0.03) substantially improved. The active range of motion of shoulder flexion and abduction substantially improved at pre-post treatment in both the device (P=0.02, 0.03) and control (P=0.02, 0.03) groups. The deviation angle of shoulder external rotation during shoulder abduction substantially improved in the device group (P=0.02), but not in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The designed wearable devices are practical and efficient for use in chronic patients with stroke. CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACT: Wearable devices are expected to be useful for future internet-of-things rehabilitation clinical trials at home and in long-term care institutions.

N2  - OBJECTIVE Automated insulin delivery is the new standard for type 1 diabetes, but exercise-related hypoglycemia remains a challenge. Our aim was to determine whether a dual-hormone closed-loop system using wearable sensors to detect exercise and adjust dosing to reduce exercise-related hypoglycemia would outperform other forms of closed-loop and open-loop therapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Participants underwent four arms in randomized order: dual-hormone, single-hormone, predictive low glucose suspend, and continuation of current care over 4 outpatient days. Each arm included three moderate-intensity aerobic exercise sessions. The two primary outcomes were percentage of time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) and in a target range (70–180 mg/dL) assessed across the entire study and from the start of the in-clinic exercise until the next meal. RESULTS The analysis included 20 adults with type 1 diabetes who completed all arms. The mean time (SD) in hypoglycemia was the lowest with dual-hormone during the exercise period: 3.4% (4.5) vs. 8.3% (12.6) single-hormone (P = 0.009) vs. 7.6% (8.0) predictive low glucose suspend (P < 0.001) vs. 4.3% (6.8) current care where preexercise insulin adjustments were allowed (P = 0.49). Time in hypoglycemia was also the lowest with dual-hormone during the entire 4-day study: 1.3% (1.0) vs. 2.8% (1.7) single-hormone (P < 0.001) vs. 2.0% (1.5) predictive low glucose suspend (P = 0.04) vs. 3.1% (3.2) current care (P = 0.007). Time in range during the entire study was the highest with single-hormone: 74.3% (8.0) vs. 72.0% (10.8) dual-hormone (P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS The addition of glucagon delivery to a closed-loop system with automated exercise detection reduces hypoglycemia in physically active adults with type 1 diabetes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Achieving A1C targets is a fundamental component of quality measures such as HEDIS and Star ratings. A positive correlation has been validated between blood sugar control and the risk for complications. Insulin is regarded as one of the most potent agents available to address hyperglycemia, however, greater than 30% of patients remain poorly controlled despite being prescribed insulin. This lack of control brings to light the need for decision makers to evaluate if new insulin delivery alternatives offer advantages for improving glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this multi-state analysis was to evaluate the achievement of blood sugar control using a 24-hour wearable insulin delivery device (V-Go) compared to prior therapy when conventional insulin delivery was prescribed. METHODS: Data from electronic medical records were used to identify patients with suboptimal glycemic control (A1C 7%) switched to insulin delivery with V-Go for this real-world retrospective analysis across 9 specialty diabetes centers. Achievement of A1C targets (< 7%, < 8%, 9.0% and > 9.0%) were compared to baseline after a mean of 7 months of V-Go use. Missing clinical data for A1C and TDD were imputed using the multiple imputation feature in SPSS and the pooled data were utilized for analyses. Differences in the achievement of A1C targets were assessed using a Chi-square test. RESULTS: Patients (N = 283) previously administering insulin via insulin pen device/syringe and switched to V-Go were evaluated. Baseline mean ± SD characteristics were A1C 9.2 ± 1.5%, weight 221 ± 45 lbs and TDD 76 ± 47 u/day (range 14 to 300). Concomitant NIGLM were prescribed in 77% of patients. At baseline, 46% of patients were at high risk (A1C > 9%) and < 25% of patients had achieved an A1C < 8% despite insulin therapy. After 7 months of V-Go use, changes from baseline in A1C and TDD were significant (P < 0.0001) and greater achievement of blood sugar targets was observed. A1C achievement of < 8% was 52% vs. 24%, P < 0.001 and ≤ 9.0% was 76% vs. 54%, P < 0.001 with V-Go compared to baseline, respectively. The percent of patients at high risk with an A1C > 9% significantly decreased from baseline with V-Go use (46% to 24%, P < 0.001). A1C < 7% was achieved by 23% of patients with V-Go. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin delivery with V-Go resulted in more patients achieving blood sugar control which will have positive implications on quality metrics. Improved blood sugar control can reduce the onset and/or progression of complications in patients with diabetes and reduce total healthcare costs.

N2  - Introduction: Peripheral artery disease is the third most prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide, with over 200 million people affected, while smoking and diabetes being the strongest risk factors. The most prominent symptom is leg pain while walking known as intermittent claudication, as the muscles do not get enough blood during exercise to meet the needs. To improve mobility, first line treatment for intermittent claudication are outpatient supervised exercise programs; however, their implementation face manifold challenges: low patient adherence, no reimbursement by insurers, high costs of course implementation, and low course availability. These barriers led to the development of home-based exercise programs, which are similarly effective when combined with a structured approach by setting exercise goals, monitoring exercise activity, and regular follow up with a coach. Therefore, this trial aims to determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of TeGeCoach, a 12-month long structured home-based exercise program, compared to the routine care of intermittent claudication. Materials & Methods: A prospective, open-label, multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TeGeCoach. 4630 patients with peripheral artery disease at Fontaine stage II, identified from three statutory health insurers in Germany, will be randomly assigned either to TeGeCoach or Treatment as Usual (routine care). TeGeCoach consists of a telephone-based health coaching to strengthen health literacy, remote walking exercise monitoring with the use of a wearable activity tracker (telemonitoring), and intensified primary care. Depending on the individual functional status and exercise capacity, participants will be asked to walk up to seven times a week. Primary outcomes are functional capacity measured by the Walking Impairment Questionnaire, alongside with total health care costs based upon routine health insurance data. Secondary outcome measures include quality of life, health literacy and health behavior. Outcomes will be measured at three time points (0, 12, and 24 months). To address dropouts appropriately, an intention-to-treat analysis strategy with multiple imputation of missing values will be employed. Differences between the groups will be identified by means of mixed effects models. Discussion: Clearly, the current routine care of intermittent claudication is partly ineffective und insufficient, with the consequence of a poorly served patient population and worsening disease condition. TeGeCoach may provide an effective and feasible alternative in the management of intermittent claudication by improving access to supervised exercise while at the same time potentially reducing health care costs.

N2  - BACKGROUND Despite the high rate of sudden death after myocardial infarction among patients with a low ejection fraction, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are contraindicated until 40 to 90 days after myocardial infarction. Whether a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator would reduce the incidence of sudden death during this high-risk period is unclear. METHODS We randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with acute myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction of 35% or less to receive a wearable cardioverter-defibrillator plus guideline-directed therapy (the device group) or to receive only guideline-directed therapy (the control group). The primary outcome was the composite of sudden death or death from ventricular tachyarrhythmia at 90 days (arrhythmic death). Secondary outcomes included death from any cause and nonarrhythmic death. RESULTS Of 2302 participants, 1524 were randomly assigned to the device group and 778 to the control group. Participants in the device group wore the device for a median of 18.0 hours per day (interquartile range, 3.8 to 22.7). Arrhythmic death occurred in 1.6% of the participants in the device group and in 2.4% of those in the control group (relative risk, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 1.21; P = 0.18). Death from any cause occurred in 3.1% of the participants in the device group and in 4.9% of those in the control group (relative risk, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.98; uncorrected P = 0.04), and nonarrhythmic death in 1.4% and 2.2%, respectively (relative risk, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.33 to 1.19; uncorrected P = 0.15). Of the 48 participants in the device group who died, 12 were wearing the device at the time of death. A total of 20 participants in the device group (1.3%) received an appropriate shock, and 9 (0.6%) received an inappropriate shock. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with a recent myocardial infarction and an ejection fraction of 35% or less, the wearable cardioverter-defibrillator did not lead to a significantly lower rate of the primary outcome of arrhythmic death than control.

N2  - Background: Efforts to increase physical activity in cancer survivors have typically been facility-based, and results have generally not been durable. Home-based interventions provide a more feasible option, and are likely to produce longer-lasting benefits. Wearable trackers present a novel opportunity for monitoring physical activity in a practical way. The Health Action Process Approach model suggests that strategies such as action-planning and overcoming barriers may be effective for transitioning individuals from intention to behavioural change. This trial aims to increase physical activity in cancer survivors at cardiovascular risk, by implementing a 24-week self-monitoring and action-planning intervention using Fitbits. Methods: Sixty-eight cancer survivors were recruited to participate in the trial. Eligibility criteria included: insufficiently physically active, presence of cardiovascular risk factors, and completion of active cancer treatment in the five years prior to recruitment. Trial assessments are performed at baseline, 12-weeks, and 24-weeks, and measure physical activity (using 7-day accelerometer data), BMI, blood pressure, physical activity attitudes, barriers and perceived outcomes. Participants were randomly allocated to treatment and control groups, following the baseline assessment. Each participant in the treatment group was given a Fitbit Alta to monitor activity for the 24-week trial, attended two 2-hour group sessions involving goal-setting and action-planning activities, and a follow-up phone call to ensure program adherence. Results: Data collection is currently underway. Data analysis will use the Group x Time interaction from a General Linear Mixed Model analysis. Conclusions: As the population of cancer survivors is largely inactive and at cardiovascular risk, interventions are warranted. Specifically, physical activity interventions that are feasible, have robust theoretical underpinnings, and suit the preferences of cancer survivors post-treatment, show promise as a long-term solution.

N2  - Background and aims: The lifetime risk of diabetic, neuropathic, plantar first foot ulceration is 25%, whereas ulcer recurrence rates for patients with ulcer history are 50-70% within 5 years. To date, effective ulcer prevention strategies remain elusive. Foot ulcer development in the insensate foot is intimately linked to high peak plantar pressures and high pressure-time integrals during gait as patients with diabetic neuropathy cannot detect aberrant pressures and do not adjust their walking strategy appropriately. We hypothesize that an intervention providing plantar pressure feedback would reduce aberrant high pressures developed during daily activities. We aimed to test efficacy of a novel plantar pressure-sensing smart insole system, the SurroSense Rx® (Orpyx Medical Technologies Inc., Canada) in reducing DFU occurrence in 'high risk' diabetic patients. This system comprises pressure-sensing inserts worn inside patients' footwear, recording continuous plantar pressure at eight sensor locations, during dayto- day life. When critical pressure thresholds are detected, a smartwatch feeds back to the patient via an alert and encourages off-loading, to modify aberrant plantar pressures developed during daily activities. Materials and methods: In this randomised controlled trial, patients with recent history of DFU, peripheral neuropathy, no peripheral vascular disease, and no current DFU were recruited from two hospital sites within Greater Manchester, UK. Ninety participants were consented, 58 were randomized, all being set-up with the pressure-sensing inserts and smartwatch. Intervention group (IG) received feedback alerts from the smartwatch when pressures were 'high', whereas Control group (CG) did not receive alerts. At baseline, participants received device training and a detailed foot check. Patients were reviewed monthly for a foot check and system calibration. Follow-up was for 18 months or until plantar ulceration occurred. Results: At follow-up, there were 10 ulcers from 8,638 person-days in CG and 4 ulcers from 11,835 person-days in IG. A Poisson regression model compared the two groups on incidence of ulceration with log exposure days as offset and showed a 71% reduction in ulcer incidence in IG (Incidence Rate Ratio = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.09-0.93) relative to the CG (p = 0.037). Characteristics of CG (n = 26) vs. IG (n = 32) were: age, 67.1(9.6) vs. 59.1(8.5) [mean (SD)]; Type 1 diabetes, n = 4 (15.4%) vs. n = 9 (28.1%); duration diabetes, 21.2 (10.7) vs. 22.2 (14.3) years; HbA1c, 58 (41-83) vs. 65.5 (38-122) [median (range)] mmol/mol. In survival analysis, the Kaplan-Meier graph and log-rank test suggested no significant difference in treatment groups in time to ulceration (18 month ulcer-free proportion: CG - 68.4%, IG - 77.5%; p = 0.30). Selfreported hours of wearing the device were: CG, 4.6 (2.9) vs. IG, 5.1 (3.0) hours/day, p = 0.63. Conclusion: Plantar pressure feedback and encouragement to offload throughout daily life via smartwatch alerts resulted in 71% lower DFU incidence after 18 months follow-up. We conclude that there has been a significant, positive impact of this plantar pressure feedback intervention on reducing DFU incidence in 'high risk' diabetic patients.

N2  - IMPORTANCE Opportunistic screening for atrial fibrillation (AF) is recommended, and improved methods of early identification could allow for the initiation of appropriate therapies to prevent the adverse health outcomes associated with AF. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of a self-applied wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) patch in detecting AF and the clinical consequences associated with such a detection strategy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A direct-to-participant randomized clinical trial and prospective matched observational cohort study were conducted among members of a large national health plan. Recruitment began November 17, 2015, and was completed on October 4, 2016, and 1-year claims-based follow-up concluded in January 2018. For the clinical trial, 2659 individuals were randomized to active home-based monitoring to start immediately or delayed by 4 months. For the observational study, 2 deidentified age-, sex- and CHA2DS2-VASc–matched controls were selected for each actively monitored individual. INTERVENTIONS The actively monitored cohort wore a self-applied continuous ECG monitoring patch at home during routine activities for up to 4 weeks, initiated either immediately after enrolling (n = 1364) or delayed for 4 months after enrollment (n = 1291). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the incidence of a new diagnosis of AF at 4 months among those randomized to immediate monitoring vs delayed monitoring. A secondary end point was new AF diagnosis at 1 year in the combined actively monitored groups vs matched observational controls. Other outcomes included new prescriptions for anticoagulants and health care utilization (outpatient cardiology visits, primary care visits, or AF-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations) at 1 year. RESULTS The randomized groups included 2659 participants (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [7.3] years; 38.6% women), of whom 1738 (65.4%) completed active monitoring. The observational study comprised 5214 (mean [SD] age, 73.7 [7.0] years; 40.5% women; median CHA2DS2-VASc score, 3.0), including 1738 actively monitored individuals from the randomized trial and 3476 matched controls. In the randomized study, new AF was identified by 4 months in 3.9% (53/1366) of the immediate group vs 0.9% (12/1293) in the delayed group (absolute difference, 3.0% [95% CI, 1.8%-4.1%]). At 1 year, AF was newly diagnosed in 109 monitored (6.7 per 100 person-years) and 81 unmonitored (2.6 per 100 person-years; difference, 4.1 [95% CI, 3.9-4.2]) individuals. Active monitoring was associated with increased initiation of anticoagulants (5.7 vs 3.7 per 100 person-years; difference, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.9-2.2]), outpatient cardiology visits (33.5 vs 26.0 per 100 person-years; difference, 7.5 [95% CI, 7.2-7.9), and primary care visits (83.5 vs 82.6 per 100 person-years; difference, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.4-1.5]). There was no difference in AF-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations (1.3 vs 1.4 per 100 person-years; difference, 0.1 [95% CI, −0.1 to 0]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among individuals at high risk for AF, immediate monitoring with a home-based wearable ECG sensor patch, compared with delayed monitoring, resulted in a higher rate of AF diagnosis after 4 months. Monitored individuals, compared with nonmonitored controls, had higher rates of AF diagnosis, greater initiation of anticoagulants, but also increased health care resource utilization at 1 year.

N2  - Objective: To measure tremor continuously, and in real world contexts, during clinical trials for Parkinson's disease and essential tremor using a wearable device. Towards this goal, to validate device-measured tremor scores against standard clinical scales. Background: Clinical assessments are the standard for measuring tremor in clinical trials, but wearable devices may provide additional value by continuously monitoring tremor and other physiological signals. An essential step in determining if wearable devices can detect treatment responses in clinical trials is to compare their output to established measures. Methods: During two Phase 2a clinical trials in Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, a wristband-device (E4 wristband, Empatica, Milano) was continuously worn by patients both inside and outside of the clinic. In addition to accelerometry, the wristband measured electrodermal activity, temperature, and heart-rate. At regular time intervals, subjects with Parkinson's disease were also assessed with the MDSUPDRS scale and with a finger-worn accelerometer (Kinesia ONE, Great Lakes NeuroTechnologies, Cleveland). Analogously, subjects with essential tremor were regularly assessed with the TETRAS scale and the finger-worn accelerometer. Custom algorithms were developed to derive a continuous, time-varying tremor score from the wristband, and to calculate an average tremor score from each subject. Across subjects, the average wristband-derived tremor score was compared to the average clinical assessment scores. Additionally, tremor was measured in subjects with Parkinson's disease following levodopa administration. Results: In the majority of subjects with Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, an oscillating signal within the expected tremorfrequency range was measurable from the wristband. Further, the two populations could be distinguished by the energy present in the tremor signal at harmonics of the tremor frequency (p<0.001). Across subjects with Parkinson's disease, the severity of wristband-measured tremor was correlated with both an MDS-UPDRS tremor sub-score (r50.74, p<0.01) and with the Kinesia score (r50.77, p<0.01). Levodopa treatment in these subjects reduced the wristband-measured tremor score (p<0.001). Across subjects with essential tremor, the severity of wristband-measured tremor was correlated with both TETRAS (r50.68, p<0.01) and the Kinesia score (r50.86, p<0.0001). Conclusions: These data indicate that tremor scores obtained from the wearable-device correlated with validated clinical scales of tremor in both Parkinson's disease and essential tremor, and that the wristbanddevice detected levodopa-mediated reduction of tremor. These results support the notion that a wearable-device may be able to accurately and continuously measure tremor in clinical trial settings and could provide additional value by measuring tremor in real world situations outside of clinical assessment windows.

N2  - Background: With ECG signals produced during periods of patient motion (stress test, ambulatory monitor) or low quality signal (dry electrode, intracardiac or fltered recording), identifcation of atrial fbrillation (AF) is assessed from temporal irregularity in RR intervals. Direct characterization of atrial activity from ECG morphology-based analysis prevents mis-classifcation of AF from regularized conduction or electronic ventricular pacing, but is diffcult with noise and the normal variation and low amplitude of P waves. Objective: Identify AF using ECG single heartbeat morphology analysis using dimensionality reduction and a support vector machine (SVM) classifer. Methods: Using raw single-lead data recorded from a wrist-worn ECG monitor and a patient known to have paroxysmal AF, a short training set of AF and normal sinus were used for model (Fig 1A,B) Dimensionality reduction with T-SNE and SVM using the radial basis function kernel (RBF) were used to obtain sensitivity/specifcity for randomly selected single heartbeats after training The model used no R-R interval data. Results: SVM classifer (Fig 1C) gave an ROC area under curve of 0.95 (Fig 1D). For single-heart-beat determination of AF, at sensitivity of 90.8% specifcity was 91.2%, and taking a majority classifcation of 7 consecutive heartbeats sensitivity and specifcity were both 100%. Conclusion: Individual heartbeat ECG analysis using machine learning techniques gives fully automated, high accuracy identifcation of AF heartbeats by morphology alone. This technique has large implications for rhythm identifcation during stress testing and analysis of signals from wearable devices. [Figure Presented].

N2  - Background: Regular physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients. However, most IHD patients do not participate in an exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation program or obtain enough physical activity on their own. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of loss-framed financial incentives with personalized goal-setting in increasing physical activity among IHD patients using wearable devices. Methods: ACTIVE REWARD was a home-based, remotely-monitored, 24-week randomized clinical trial with a 16-week intervention (8-week ramp-up incentive phase and then 8-week maintenance incentive phase) and an 8-week follow-up. 105 IHD patients were enrolled from four hospitals in Southeastern Pennsylvania. All patients tracked daily steps using a wearable device and established a baseline step count. Patients in control received no other interventions. Patients in the incentive arm received personalized step goals and daily feedback for all 24 weeks. In the ramp-up incentive phase (weeks 1-8), daily step goals increased from baseline by 15% each week to a maximum of 10,000 steps and then remained fixed during the maintenance incentive phase (weeks 9-16) and follow-up (weeks 17-24). Incentives were loss-framed by allocating $ 14 each week to a virtual account; $ 2 could be lost per day for not achieving step goals. The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the maintenance incentive phase. Secondary outcomes were change in mean daily steps from baseline to the ramp-up incentive phase and follow-up. Results: Patients had a mean (SD) age of 60 (11) years, 70% were male, and all had ischemic heart disease. Compared to control, patients in the incentive arm had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during ramp-up (1388 vs. 385; adjusted difference, 1061 steps [95% CI, 386-1736]; P<.01), maintenance (1501 vs. 264; adjusted difference, 1368 steps [95% CI, 571-2164]; P<.001), and follow-up (1066 vs. 92; adjusted difference, 1154 steps [95% CI, 282-2027]; P<.01). Conclusions: Loss-framed financial incentives with personalized goal-setting significantly increased physical activity among IHD patients using wearable devices during the 16-week intervention and effects were sustained during the 8-week follow-up.

N2  - Background: Older patients with frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiological reserve, are at risk for adverse outcomes. Physical activity can improve function in cardiovascular patients, but many are unable to attend cardiac rehab. Methods: The Get Going trial is an ongoing multicenter clinical trial of older patients meeting criteria on the FRAIL questionnaire with heart failure (HF) or coronary artery disease (CAD) randomized at hospital discharge to goal-oriented vs. monitor-only wearable actigraphy devices. Differences in baseline characteristics, short physical performance battery (SPPB; 0-12) and EuroQOL 5-D (0-5) were compared across diagnosis group. Results: Of 58 participants randomized (21 CAD; 37 HF), median age was 74, 75% male, with a mean SPPB score of 7.5 (±3.4). Patients with HF had more atrial fibrillation (p=0.01), pacemakers (p=0.04), chronic kidney disease (p=0.02), pulmonary hypertension (p=0.01), and lower left ventricular ejection fraction (p=0.04), but there were no difference in baseline frailty, quality of life, SPPB scores or physical tests between groups (Table). Conclusion: Older adults hospitalized for CAD or HF had similar functional impairments, supporting inclusion of both for interventions aimed at improving post-discharge care. Ongoing follow up will inform the utility of actigraphy for improving function in these at risk patients.

N2  - Background: Despite extensive clinical experience with naloxone, no consensus exists on standard observation times after administration. Wearable biosensors can detect opioid effect and may be a useful adjunct in these cases. Research Question: Can wearable biosensors detect a physiologic change consistent with recurrent opioid effect after reversal of opioid overdose with naloxone? Methods: This is an observational trial of patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) after opioid overdose treated with naloxone. A wearable biosensor was placed on the non-dominant wrist of each participant from the time of ED arrival until one of three clinical endpoints was reached: (A) discharge from the ED, (B) admission to the hospital, or (C) 1 h post administration of a repeat dose of naloxone, if applicable. Physiologic parameters measured continuously by the sensor included heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and accelerometry in three axes (x, y, and z axes). Physiologic data from the sensor were analyzed using a slide window technique to determine change over time after naloxone administration. Within each window, mean variance was calculated and a Hilbert transformation was applied to extract relevant features of the data (shape and scale parameters). Profiles obtained were compared pre-and post-key time points (30, 60, 90, and 120 min post-naloxone administration) and a student's t test was used to determine significant differences. Results: Of the 29 participants enrolled, physiologic parameters transitioned in 73% around 90-min post-naloxone from a neutral profile to a profile consistent with opioid effect. Only three individuals received a repeat dose of naloxone; they did not appear significantly different from the remainder of the participants in transition characteristics. Discussion: A wearable biosensor detected the cessation of naloxone activity at approximately 90 min post administration in this small population. With a low rate of recurrent naloxone utilization, we were underpowered to identify a profile predictive of recurrent toxicity requiring repeat dosing. With further research, wearable sensors may provide a valuable tool for post-naloxone monitoring both in and out of the hospital setting. Conclusion: Wearable biosensors can detect physiologic parameters consistent with opioid effect 90 min after naloxone administration.

N2  - Background: Treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) suffers from high rates of relapse. The ability to identify moments of greatest risk and deliver targeted interventions in real time would provide a tremendous advantage over the current model of care. Wearable biosensors have the potential to fill this role. Research Question: Can wearable biosensors detect changes in physiol-ogy related to drug craving during treatment for SUD? Methods: This is an observational trial of individuals enrolled in an intensive outpatient treatment program for SUD. Participants wore a wrist-mounted biosensor on their non-dominant arm during all waking hours for a 4-day period. An event marker was used to denote any time they perceived drug craving or stress. Physiologic parameters measured continuously by the sensor included heart rate, skin conductance, skin temperature, and accelerometry in three axes (x, y and z axes). For analysis, raw biosensor data were evaluated 20 min before and 20 min after each marked event A slide window technique was used to evaluate 5-min windows with a 4-min overlap. Within each window, mean variance was calculated and a Hilbert transformation was applied to extract relevant features (shape and scale parameters). Using a six-dimension hypothetical space with each of the sensor measures representing an axis, we defined a measure to characterize the pre-and post-event data and compared these using a Student's t test Results: Thirty participants were enrolled, and a total of 50 episodes of stress and 40 episodes of drug craving were analyzed. Craving episodes showed significantly different parameters than baseline on the y axis (p = 0 00), and significantly different parameters than stress on the x (p = 0.009) and y (p = 0.00) axes. Stress episodes were significantly different than drug craving episodes on the x (p = 0.00), y (p = 0.003), and z (p = 0.03) axes. Discussion: By providing an objective measure of drug craving that can be ascertained in real time, wearable biosensors offer a unique opportunity for mobile interventions during substance abuse treatment. Conclusion: Wearable biosensors can identify physiologic changes associated with drug craving in individuals during treatment for SUD.

N2  - Introduction The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD; Life-Vest©) is a treatment option for patients at high risk for ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), either in whom this risk may be temporarily or in whom an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation is currently not possible. Methods Retrospective registry of patients in Austria who received a WCD 2010-2016. Results 720 Austrian patients in 56 centers (59 ± 15 years; 22% female) received a WCD. Main indications were: Newly diagnosed severe cardiomyopathy (20%), recent myocardial infarction (18%), delayed ICD implantation (13%), ischemic cardiomyopathy with recent PCI (11%), acute myocarditis (12%), ICD-associated infection (10%). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 32 ± 15%, median CHA2DS2-VASc-Score 3 (2-5). 46% of patients had VT/VF before the WCD period. The median WCD duration was 55 (1-436) days. There was no difference in WCD compliance between patients wearing the WCD < 60 days vs. > 60 days (23 [3-24] h/day vs 22 [1-24] h/day; n. s.). 25 patients (3.5%) received adequate WCD shocks for VT/VF, terminating the arrhythmia. Four inadequate shocks in 3 patients (0.4%) occured. Only 51% of all 720 patients required ICD implantation after the WCD period. Of the 85 patients with myocarditis, only 11 patients (19%) required an ICD. Conclusion The WCD is an effective treatment option in patients at high risk for VT/VF and/or mandated waiting period for ICD implantation. Only 51% of patients require an ICD after the WCD period.

N2  - Introduction: Whilst a reduced ejection fraction (EF) is clearly an indication for the implantation of an ICD, the results of randomized trials and current guidelines demand a waiting period in which the patient might recover and is no longer indicated for an ICD. During this period of Guideline directed medial therapy (GDMT) the patient is at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD). The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) allows us to discharge those patients knowing that they will be protected by a noninvasive, reversible method. The correlation between such parameters as patient age or the baseline EF, and the rate of recovery is still unclear. Methodology: Based on the recommendations of the HRS and the screening protocol of our institution we prescribed a WCD for every patient with an EF of 35% and lower. During the period GDMT patients were monitored by the deviceown telemonitoring system. Reevaluation was initiated after a period of 10-12 weeks, to determine the necessity for ICD/CRT-D implantation. Patients were divided in an ICM and NICM group. Age, ejection fraction upon admission and after three momnths were analysed. Results: 116 Patients with LVEF<35% have been fitted with the wearable cardioverter defibrillator. The median weartime was 23,4 h/d SD ± 3,7. In the total cohort 51 pts (44%) did not show EF improvement above (≤35%), hence the decision was made to implant an ICD/CRT-D. The patients showed an age-dependent improvement of ejection fraction. All patients aged 30-44 years showed improvement in ejection fraction >35%. Despite the fact that in the older population the recovery is lower, still 38% of patients aged between 75 and 89 years experienced recovery and did not need an ICD/CRTD. The older the patients, the more unlikely was a recovery to an EF >35%. A correlation between baseline EF and recovery rate could not be shown. Summary: The usage of the wearable cardioverter defibrillator supported in determining candidates for an ICD. When patients were reevaluated a significant number did not need an ICD after the waiting period due to significant improvement of the ejection fraction. Data show a clear age-dependent improvement in ejection fraction. A dependency on baseline EF could not be shown. (Figure Presented).

N2  - Introduction: The wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD; LifeVest ©) is a treatment option for patients at high risk for ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), either in whom this risk may be present temporarely or in whom an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation is currently not possible. Methods: Retrospective registry of all patients in Austria who received a WCD 2009-2017. Results: 588 Austrian patients in 48 centers (62±14 years; 26% female) received a WCD. Main indications were: Newly diagnosed severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (20%), recent myocardial infarction (19%), delayed ICD implantation (16%), ischemic cardiomyopathy with recent PCI (11%), acute myocarditis (11%), ICD-associated infection (10%). Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 32±15%, median CHA2DS2-VASc-Score 3 (2-5). 48% of all patients had VT/VF before the WCD period. The median WCD duration was 56 (1-436) days. There was no difference in WCD compliance between patients wearing the WCD <60 days vs. >60 days (23 (3-24) h/day vs. 22 (1-24) h/day; n.s.). 23 patients (3.9%) received adequate WCD shocks for VT/VF, terminating the arrhythmia. 15 patients received an ICD, one patient received a CABG, one refused ICD Implantation, two patients died subsequently due to cardiogenic shock and four patients are still wearing the WCD. Three patients (0.5%) received an inadequate shock. Main reasons for termination of the WCD period were: ICD Implantation (48%), restitutio (26%), patient desire (4%), ablation (2%) or PCI/CABG (2%). 92 (16%) patients are still wearing the WCD. Four patients (0.7%) died during WCD period due to asystole or didn't wear the WCD at timepoint of death. Of the 63 patients with myocarditis, only nine patients (14%) required an ICD versus other 70% all over (p<0.001). Conclusion: The WCD is an effective treatment option in patients at high risk for VT/VF and/or mandated waiting period for ICD implantation. Only 48% of patients require an ICD after the WCD period.

N2  - Background: The wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) is an established treatment option for patients at high risk for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF), either in whom this risk may only be temporarely present, or in patients at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) or after VT/VF in whom an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD is currently not possible for other reasons (infection, recent MI <40 days, recent PCI/CABG < 3 months etc.) and in accordance with recent ESC guidelines. Methods: Comprehensive registry including all patients in Austria who received a WCD in 2010-2015. Results: Overall, 275 Austrian patients (59±14 years; 26 % female) received a WCD in 29 hospitals (range 1-61 patients/ hospital) in Austria in 2010-2015. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at the time of WCD initiation was 33±15 %, median CHA2DS2VASc-Score was 3 (2-5). 49 % of patients had VT/VF before the WCD initiation. Main indications for WCD therapy were: recent myocardial infarction with an LVEF<35 % (20 %), Newly diagnosed severe non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (25 %), severe ischemic cardiomyopathy with recent PCI/CABG (17 %), severe acute myocarditis (12 %), delay in ICD implantation due to infection, logistic reasons, or other (12 %), ICD-associated infection requiring temporal ICD explantation (9 %), VT planned to undergo ablation (1 %), inherited arrhythmic disease (1 %), post partum cardiomyopathy (1 %), or other (1 %). The median WCD therapy duration was 60 (1-436) days per patient. There was no difference in WCD compliance between patients wearing the WCD <60 days vs. >60 days (23 (3-24) h/ day vs. 22 (1-24) h/day; p = n.s.). 6 patients (2.2 %) received 8 adequate WCD shocks for VT/VF, with all shocks terminating VT/VF to sinus rhythm. All 6 patients who received WCD shocks subsequently received an ICD. No inadequate WCD shocks occured. During the WCD period, 4 patients suffered minor side effects (local skin irritation), whereas 2 patients had to terminate the WCD treatment prematurely due to skin pressure points and bruises. Main reasons for termination of the WCD therapy were ICD implantation (47 %), improvement of LVEF to >35 % with no subsequent need for ICD implantation (31 %), desire of the patient (4 %), terminal non cardiac disease (2 %), side effects of WCD therapy (1 %), non cardiac death (1 %), successful catheter ablation (1 %), whereas in the remaining patients the WCD is still in use. Interestingly, of the 34 patients with severe myocarditis with an LVEF < 35 % and/or VT/VF who received a WCD for protection from SCD, only 5 patients (14 %) subsequently required an ICD after the WCD period, highlighting the clinical importance of the WCD use especially in this patient cohort. Conclusions: The WCD is an effective treatment option in patients at temporal high risk for VT/VF and/or during a mandated waiting period for ICD implantation. Only 49 % of patients undergoing WCD therapy subsequently require ICD implantation.

N2  - Introduction: Traditional predictors of paroxysmal AF (PAF) including left atria size, CHADSVASC score or rate of atria premature beats are inaccurate to predict PAF in elderly stroke patients. We aimed to evaluate the yield of atrial dysfunction markers such as NT-ProBNP and Left atrial deformability in acute elderly cryptogenic stroke patients to predict PAF. Methods: We prospectively evaluated cryptogenic stroke patients <72 hours from stroke symptoms. All patients underwent NTProBNP level measurement and left atrial strain (LAS) assessment by speckle tracking echocardiography. We performed a continuous wearable Holter monitoring from the admission up to 4 weeks after stroke. Results: Out of 150 cryptogenic stroke patients, one hundred and ten patients fulfilled 4 weeks of Holter monitoring. Median age was 75 years (69-83).The percentage of PAF detection was 24.5%. Age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, CHADSVASC score, NIHSSS, left atria volume, left ventricle ejection fraction and rate of atria premature beats were comparable between patients with and without PAF detection. Admission NT-ProBNP levels were higher (346.9 pg/ml [175-685]) in whom PAF was detected compared to those who did not (203.5 pg/ml [76.75-453.95] (p=0.028). Conversely, LAS was lower 18.66% [13.98-26.71] in PAF compared to no PAF detected patients 27.43% [21.28-36-56] (p=0.003). Both markers were inversely correlated (Spearman Rho -0.31) (p=0.007). The AUC of NT-ProBNP was 0.65 (0-53-0.76) with cut-off point of NT-ProBNP> 102 pg/ml (sensitivity 96%, specificity 33%) and LAS was 0.73 (0.59-0.86) with cut-off point of LAS <19.28% (sensitivity 50%, specificity 80.4%). The combination of both atrial dysfunction markers showed an AUC of 0.76 (0.69-0.88) with cut-off point of 0.23 (sensitivity 94%, specificity 50%). Conclusions: The combination of both NT-ProBNP and LAS markedly improve the predictive accuracy for PAF detection in elderly cryptogenic stroke patients.

N2  - High-resolution measurement of medication adherence is essential to personalized drug therapy. A US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared device, using an edible ingestion sensor (IS), external wearable patch, and paired mobile device can detect and record ingestion events. Oral medications must be combined with an IS to generate precise “digitized-medication” ingestion records. We developed a Good Manufacturing Practice protocol to repackage oral medications with the IS within certified Capsugel capsules, termed co-encapsulation (CoE). A randomized bioequivalence study of CoE-IS-Rifamate (Isoniazid/Rifampin 150/300 mg) vs. native-Rifamate was conducted in 12 patients with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis and demonstrated bioequivalence using the population method ratio test (95% confidence interval). Subsequently, CoE-IS-medications across all biopharmaceutical classes underwent in vitro dissolution testing utilizing USP and FDA guidelines. CoE-IS medications tested met USP dissolution specifications and were equivalent to their native formulations. CoE combines oral medications with the IS without altering the quality of the native formulation, generating “digitized” medications for remote capture of dosing histories.

N2  - Background:Common reasons for hospitalization of people with Alzheimer's disease (dementia) are syncope (fainting), fall and trauma (26%) [1]. People with dementia have limited ability to maintain and use wearable devices, giving rise to a passive floor-based personnel-monitoring system, which may be a solution. There is value in passively monitoring people in their daily activities. We enhanced the prototype smart carpet [2], which is a floor based personnel detector system, to detect falls using computational intelligence. Furthermore we have extended this work to estimate step length, step time walking speed and stride length since early indications of functional loss include change in gait characteristics. Methods: Up to 128 sensors produce a voltage due to a person walking on the carpet. We obtained the walking data from both the smart carpet and the GAITRite [3] mat simultaneously by overlaying the smart carpet over the GAITRite mat. Subjects walked across the carpet and mat for 9 trials each. The data acquisition system of the smart carpet recorded the location of the active sensors, and used to extract the gait parameters. Volunteers performed 9 walks. Data frames read from the data acquisition system provided step counts, walking distance and time. Results: We achieved excellent agreement for walking speed, stride length and stride time between the two systems. The mean percentage error difference for walking speed is 1.43% (SD, 4.4%), stride length is -4.32% and stride time is -5.73%. We compared our work to the work done using a Kinect and web cameras system with excellent agreement. Conclusions: As we showed previously we can detect falls with high accuracy and display this data in real-time. We can now estimate important gait parameter that can lead to an assessment of fall risk.

N2  - Introduction: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a heart muscle disease characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy without a systemic etiology and is associated with heart failure, stroke and sudden death. Disease prevalence is estimated at 1:500, but ∼84% remain undiagnosed. Patients with obstructive HCM (oHCM) have dynamic obstruction of the LV outflow tract and characteristic abnormalities in arterial bloodflow patterns. Hypothesis: Arterial pulsewaves recorded with a wearable biosensor and analyzed with machine learning algorithms could identify a signature of oHCM when compared to unaffected controls. Methods: We compared baseline arterial pulse wave morphology, obtained by photoplethysmography using an investigational wristworn biosensor (Wavelet Health, Mtn. View, CA), from oHCM patients enrolled in a digital health substudy of PIONEER HCM (NCT02842242) to unaffected controls from a Wavelet Health database. Five minute recordings were obtained at rest, and data sets were divided into training and validation cohorts. A beat-by-beat machine learning model was developed using a predefined feature set to calculate an HCM probability score, and an optimal threshold score was determined. The model was evaluated using summary statistics and an ROC area-under-curve metric. Results: Arterial pulsewave recordings were obtained from 14 patients with oHCM at rest and 81 unaffected controls. An oHCM machine learning classifier was developed based on 42 calculated metrics. After training and cross-validation (n=9 oHCM, n=48 control), the model achieved 98% accuracy. Application of this model to a validation cohort (n=5 oHCM, n=33 control) confirmed an increased probability in oHCM patients compared to unaffected controls (0.40 ± 0.13 vs. 0.18 ± 0.10; p=0.006). Analysis of the ROC curve in the pooled cohort shows an area under the curve of 0.88. Conclusion: This first-of-its-kind study suggests that a signature of arterial bloodflow in oHCM can be identified with the combination of a wristworn biosensor and machine learning algorithms. These data raise the possibility of a novel approach to the non-invasive detection of oHCM.

N2  - Introduction: Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) have the potential to enhance patient-provider communication and assessment through active and passive evaluation and tracking. Early detection may lead to earlier interventions and better outcomes for complex medical conditions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) is a prime example of a complex medical treatment that causes significant symptom burdens for patients. We developed a mHealth app for HCT patients to allow for daily evaluation of patient health and symptoms. We conducted a survey to evaluate interest and usability in a group of HCT survivors and piloted this app with allogeneic HCT patients in a phase 1 clinical trial. Methods: In collaboration with Sicklesoft Inc., we developed a mHealth app, Technology Recordings to better Understand BMT (TRU-BMT), to facilitate wellness tracking and symptom reporting. Patients can enter their food intake, exercise, sleep habits, general health, mood, and daily symptoms (Figure 1). The app provided automatic reports to patients with information about trends over time. To gain feedback and gauge interest, we surveyed transplant survivors at the 2017 BMT InfoNet Symposium in Raleigh, North Carolina. Participants explored the app on iPads and then answered a user experience survey developed with the Behavioral Health and Survey Research Core to evaluate both usability as well as perceived helpfulness. To test real-world usability and feasibility of daily data entry, we also enrolled patients actively undergoing allogeneic HCT in a phase 1 trial. Patients were given Apple devices (iPad Mini, iPad Air) containing the TRU-BMT app to use at the start of transplant. Patients were taught how to use the app and received follow up visits to ensure that they were not struggling to enter data and that no technical difficulties were occurring with the devices. Results: A total of 31 surveys were collected at the BMT InfoNet Symposium. The median age was 62 (range 26-76), 55% were male. 76% of respondents thought TRU-BMT was easy to use; 67% felt confident in its use after only a few minutes of testing; and 80% thought most people could learn to use the app quickly. 83% thought daily symptom input would be useful. 76% would use the app at least 4 times per week, with 44% would use it daily. While there was a correlation between how helpful a participant perceived TRU-BMT and the number of days per week they could see themselves using the app, there was no correlation between age and any of the above responses. Nine patients have been enrolled on the phase I study to determine feasibility (Table 1). Four patients used TRU-BMT nearly every day throughout their transplant, one used TRU-BMT 2-3 times per week throughout transplant, and two are ongoing. One patient enrolled but never started using the app due to multiple medical complications surrounding conditioning chemotherapy. One patient used TRU-BMT for three days but then developed a medical complication, felt overwhelmed, and stopped. Patients have self-reported that in addition to filling out the app themselves, their caregivers also assisted in this process. Discussion: To our knowledge, TRU-BMT is the first mobile health app that specifically addresses symptom reporting and general wellness in the HCT patient population. Patients think such an app is useful, and they will use it daily for up to 90 days during transplant. One of the main concerns in using mHealth apps is making it accessible to patients of all ages. However, according to feedback from survey participants as well as patients using the app, age does not seem to impact a patient's desire or ability to use the app or wearable device. The biggest barrier to consistent use appears to be the health of the patient, as those who had the lowest number of entries or shortest duration of use had complicated transplants, during which symptom management and rest took precedence over data entry. We aim to continue evaluating this app in the setting of long-term follow up and surveillance of symptoms and early detection of complications such as chronic graft-versus-host disease. Given that our most significant challenge in adherence was the medical status of the patient, we predict that patients who have been successfully discharged from transplant will have an easier time complying. Our goal is to facilitate communication between the patient and the healthcare team, permitting closer follow up leading to improved outcomes. (Table Presented).

N2  - Introduction Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating problems in breast cancer survivors (BCS) that can persist many years beyond successful cancer treatment. Parasympathetic nervous system activity (measured via heart-rate variability; HRV), cortisol dysregulation and decreased physical activity are plausible, but understudied contributors to CRF. Repeated daily measurements of CRF and tracking daily physical activity over a 12-week period should give more information regarding temporal patterns of CRF among BCS. Objective The purpose of this study is 1) to investigate patterns of CRF in fatigued BCS over time; 2) to assess HRV, salivary cortisol and level of physical activity as predictors of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in BCS over a 12-week period; and 3) to explore whether a smartphone application intervention results in increased daily physical activity, as well as improved HRV, salivary cortisol and CRF in BCS relative to healthy female controls over a 12 week period. Methods A total of 30 fatigued breast cancer survivors (FACIT-F score ≤ 34) and 30 aged-matched female controls will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. Both groups will receive a smartphone application tracking daily physical activity. While the intervention group will receive this application with feedback regarding their daily physical activity, the control groups will receive the application without feedback. Behavioral data will be collected by means of GPS and Wi-Fi for localization, and accelerometer, barometer, magnetometer and gyroscope for activity recognition. HRV and salivary cortisol will be collected at rest, as well as during and after a significant stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). Fatigue will be measured by the FACIT-F Scale, which will be completed at baseline (T1), 4 weeks (T2) and 12 weeks (T3). Group differences will be tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and intervention effects will be analyzed using mixed models with repeated measurements. Hypotheses We hypothesize that HRV, cortisol dysregulation and level of physical activity at baseline can predict CRF-recovery over a 12-week period. The smartphone application will be associated with improved physical activity in the BCS intervention group and that changes of physiological correlates of CRF can be observed (i.e., HRV and salivary cortisol). Conclusion This study will examine associations between HRV, salivary cortisol, physical activity and CRF in BCS over time. The results of this study may provide insight into factors that contribute to the development, persistence and/or consequences of CRF by use of an innovative mobile application.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) is of pivotal importance for stroke prevention. Recent studies confirmed the merits of long-term monitoring. Currently available diagnostic tools are burdened with disadvantages of inconvenience, costs or invasiveness. In a previous study we tested an app that employed photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals of a smartphone camera to distinguish between AF and sinus rhythm (SR) based on the newly developed Preventicus Heartbeats algorithm. That retrospective study has been shown to achieved a sensitivity and specificity of 95%. In the WATCH AF study, this algorithm is tested for the first time with PPG signals from a smartwatch (Samsung) and a wristband (Wavelet health). Our study aims to determine the accuracy of these applications compared to an ambulatory ECG system. METHODS: In this prospective, blind, international, multicenter-study, 600 subjects are being recruited until March 2017. Subjects must be of legal age. SR group is ageand gender-matched with the AF group. Pulse wave curves will be recorded for five minutes simultaneously with a smartwatch on one and a wristband on the other arm (sides randomized). At the same time, an ambulatory ECG system will record a synchronous ECG as a reference. The pulse wave curve data will be analysed in a blinded manner off-line with the Preventicus Heartbeats algorithm and will then be labelled as either SR or AF. Additionally, information about cardiovascular risk factors, concomitant disease and medication are collected. Primary target parameters are the app's sensitivity and specificity in correctly detecting AF compared to an automatically interpreted ECG. Secondary target parameters include the proportion of non-evaluable recordings in the overall study and differences between the two devices. RESULTS: The enrolment is expected to be complete in March 2017. Complete trial results are expected for in May 2017. CONCLUSION: WATCH AF is the first study to validate PPG signals from the wrist to detect AF in a blinded, ECG controlled fashion.

N2  - Introduction Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most prevalent and debilitating problems in breast cancer survivors (BCS) that can persist many years beyond successful cancer treatment. Parasympathetic nervous system activity (measured via heart-rate variability; HRV), cortisol dysregulation and decreased physical activity are plausible, but understudied contributors to CRF. Repeated daily measurements of CRF and tracking daily physical activity over a 12-week period should give more information regarding temporal patterns of CRF among BCS. Objective The purpose of this study is 1) to investigate patterns of CRF in fatigued BCS over time; 2) to assess HRV, salivary cortisol and level of physical activity as predictors of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in BCS over a 12-week period; and 3) to explore whether a smartphone application intervention results in increased daily physical activity, as well as improved HRV, salivary cortisol and CRF in BCS relative to healthy female controls over a 12 week period. Methods A total of 30 fatigued breast cancer survivors (FACIT-F score < 34) and 30 aged-matched female controls will be randomly assigned to either an intervention or control group. Both groups will receive a smartphone application tracking daily physical activity. While the intervention group will receive this application with feedback regarding their daily physical activity, the control groups will receive the application without feedback. Behavioral data will be collected by means of GPS and Wi-Fi for localization, and accelerometer, barometer, magnetometer and gyroscope for activity recognition. HRV and salivary cortisol will be collected at rest, as well as during and after a significant stressor (Trier Social Stress Test). Fatigue will be measured by the FACIT-F Scale, which will be completed at baseline (T1), 4 weeks (T2) and 12 weeks (T3). Group differences will be tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and intervention effects will be analyzed using mixed models with repeated measurements. Hypotheses We hypothesize that HRV, cortisol dysregulation and level of physical activity at baseline can predict CRF-recovery over a 12-week period. The smartphone application will be associated with improved physical activity in the BCS intervention group and that changes of physiological correlates of CRF can be observed (i.e., HRV and salivary cortisol). Conclusion This study will examine associations between HRV, salivary cortisol, physical activity and CRF in BCS over time. The results of this study may provide insight into factors that contribute to the development, persistence and/or consequences of CRF by use of an innovative mobile application.

N2  - Objective: To implement and validate quantification of motor dysfunction in a Huntington's disease (HD) clinical trial using machine learning algorithmic analysis derived from biometric monitoring through a smartphone and wearable sensor combination. Background: Motor symptoms in HD are typically evaluated by clinicians using rating scales, such as the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale total motor score (UHDRS-TMS). Assessments are infrequent, inherently subjective, may lead to intra- and inter-rater variability, and are prone to placebo response. The use of biometric health solutions could enable objective, real-time monitoring of motor dysfunction in both clinical research and patient care. Methods: Up to 60 HD patients with a pre-defined spectrum of motor dysfunction will be included in a sub-study of Open Pride-HD (NCT02494778; Phase II, open-label, extension study) after meeting a set of pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Participants will be asked to use the biometric monitoring platform for 6 months. High- frequency movement-tracking data will be collected using an iPhone and wearable Pebble smartwatch combination and streamed continuously to a secure cloud-based analytics platform. 3D accelerometer and gyroscope data that reflect the intensity and direction of movements will be collected at the patients' homes and during in-clinic visits. Results: The digital health sub-study of Open Pride-HD started enrolling patients in December 2016 with anticipated duration for up to 2 years. The collected information, comprising accelerometer data, app-enabled patient-reported severity assessments of motor dysfunction, and in-clinic sessions, will be used to assess the validity of biometric monitoring as a means of providing reliable information on motor dysfunction in HD patients between and during clinic visits. Conclusions: The design of this innovative study in HD is poised to set the foundation for the development of biometric monitoring solutions as a key component of HD management in clinical trials and everyday care.

N2  - Some individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) experience not only cognitive deficits but also a decline in motor function, including postural balance. This pilot study sought to estimate the feasibility, user experience, and effects of a novel sensor-based balance training program. Patients with amnestic MCI (mean age 78.2 yr) were randomized to an intervention group (IG, n = 12) or control group (CG, n = 10). The IG underwent balance training (4 wk, twice a week) that included weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing. Real-time visual/audio lower-limb motion feedback was provided from wearable sensors. The CG received no training. User experience was measured by a questionnaire. Postintervention effects on balance (center of mass sway during standing with eyes open [EO] and eyes closed), gait (speed, variability), cognition, and fear of falling were measured. Eleven participants (92%) completed the training and expressed fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor feedback. Sway (EO, p = 0.04) and fear of falling (p = 0.02) were reduced in the IG compared to the CG. Changes in other measures were nonsignificant. Results suggest that the sensorbased training paradigm is well accepted in the target population and beneficial for improving postural control. Future studies should evaluate the added value of the sensor-based training compared to traditional training.

N2  - Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cause of stroke and a marker of atherosclerosis and of all patients with stroke, around 17% have AF. The screening and treatment of AF could prevent about 12% of all strokes. Several relatively low-cost devices with good accuracy now exist which can detect AF including WatchBP and AliveCor. However, they can only measure the ECG or pulse over short time periods. Inexpensive devices such as heart rate monitors, which are widely available, can measure heart rate for prolonged periods and may have potential in screening for AF. This study aims to determine the accuracy of AliveCor and WatchBP along with a bespoke algorithm using a heart rate monitor belt (Polar H7) and a wearable RR interval recorder (Firstbeat Bodyguard 2) for detecting AF during a single screening visit in primary care patients. Methods/analysis A multicentre case-control diagnostic study comparing the four different devices for the detection of AF with a reference standard consisting of a 12-lead ECG in GP surgeries across Hampshire, UK. We aim to recruit 92 participants with AF and 329 without AF aged 65â €..years and over. We will ask participants to rate comfort and overall impression for each device. We will collect qualitative data from participants capturing their experience of using wearable devices in order to evaluate acceptability. We will collect data from GPS to determine their views on AF screening. Ethics and dissemination This protocol was approved by the London-City & East Research Ethics Committee in June 2016. The findings of the trial will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and the Atrial Fibrillation Association, UK. Trial registration number ISRCTN17495003, Pre-results.

N2  - Background: Social isolation after a stroke is related to poor outcomes. Typical measures of social networks rely on self-report, which is vulnerable to response bias and measurement error. We aimed to test the accuracy of an objective measure-wearable cameras-to capture face-to-face social interactions in stroke patients. Methods: In this prospective study, ten stroke survivors each wore two wearable cameras (Autographer and Narrative Clip) that automatically took a picture every 20-30 seconds. Patients mingled with healthy controls for five minutes of one-on-one interactions followed by five minutes of no interaction for two hours. After the event, two blinded judges assessed whether photograph sequences identified interactions or non-interactions. Diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated. Results: 8776 photographs were taken and adjudicated. In distinguishing interactions, the Autographer's sensitivity was 1.00 and specificity was 0.98. The Narrative Clip's sensitivity was 0.58 and specificity was 1.00. The receiver operating characteristic curves of the two devices were statistically different (Z=8.26, p<0.001). Conclusions: Wearable cameras can accurately detect social interactions of stroke patients. Likely due to its large field of view, the Autographer was more sensitive than the Narrative Clip for this purpose.

N2  - Background: Cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) have deficits in sensory and motor skills leading to inappropriate proprioceptive feedback, impaired postural control, and fall risk. Balance training programs specifically developed for CIPN patients are lacking. Objective: This pilot study investigated the effect of an interactive motor adaptation balance training program based on wearable sensors for improving balance in older cancer patients with CIPN. Methods: Twenty-two patients (age: 70.3 ± 8.7 years) with objectively confirmed CIPN [vibration perception threshold (VPT) >25 V] were randomized to either an intervention (IG) or a control (CG) group. The IG received interactive game-based balance training including repetitive weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing tasks. Wearable sensors provided real-time visual/auditory feedback from the lower limb trajectory and allowed the perception of motor errors during each motor action. The CG received no exercise intervention and continued their normal activity. Outcome measures were changes in sway of ankle, hip, and center of mass (CoM) in both mediolateral and anteroposterior (AP) directions during 30-second balance tests with increasing task difficulty [i.e. standing in feet-closed position with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), and in semi-tandem position with EO] at baseline and after the intervention. Additionally, gait performance (speed, variability) and fear of falling [Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)] were measured. Results: Training was safe despite the participants' impaired health status, great severity of CIPN (VPT 49.6 ± 26.7 V), and great fear of falling (FES-I score 31.37 ± 11.20). After the intervention, sway of hip, ankle, and CoM was significantly reduced in the IG compared to the CG while standing in feet-closed position with EO (p = 0.010-0.022, except AP CoM sway) and in semi-tandem position (p = 0.008-0.035, except ankle sway). No significant effects were found for balance with EC, gait speed, and FES-I score (p > 0.05). Conclusions: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that older cancer patients with CIPN can significantly improve their postural balance with specifically tailored, sensor-based exercise training. The training approach has potential as a therapy for improving CIPN-related postural control deficits. However, future studies comparing the proposed technology-based training with traditional balance training are required to evaluate the benefit of the interactive joint movement feedback.

N2  - Background: Wearable sensor technology can accurately measure body motion and provide incentive feedback during exercising. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the effectiveness and user experience of a balance training program in older adults integrating data from wearable sensors into a human-computer interface designed for interactive training. Methods: Senior living community residents (mean age 84.6) with confirmed fall risk were randomized to an intervention (IG, n = 17) or control group (CG, n = 16). The IG underwent 4 weeks (twice a week) of balance training including weight shifting and virtual obstacle crossing tasks with visual/auditory real-time joint movement feedback using wearable sensors. The CG received no intervention. Outcome measures included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) balance test at baseline and post-intervention. Ankle-hip postural coordination was quantified by a reciprocal compensatory index (RCI). Physical performance was quantified by the Alternate-Step-Test (AST), Timed-up-and-go (TUG), and gait assessment. User experience was measured by a standardized questionnaire. Results: After the intervention sway of CoM, hip, and ankle were reduced in the IG compared to the CG during both EO and EC condition (p = .007-.042). Improvement was obtained for AST (p = .037), TUG (p = .024), fast gait speed (p = . 010), but not normal gait speed (p = .264). Effect sizes were moderate for all outcomes. RCI did not change significantly. Users expressed a positive training experience including fun, safety, and helpfulness of sensor-feedback. Conclusions: Results of this proof-of-concept study suggest that older adults at risk of falling can benefit from the balance training program. Study findings may help to inform future exercise interventions integrating wearable sensors for guided game-based training in home- and community environments. Future studies should evaluate the added value of the proposed sensor-based training paradigm compared to traditional balance training programs and commercial exergames.

N2  - Technology development in wearable sensors and biosignal processing has made it possible to detect human stress from the physiological features. However, the intersubject difference in stress responses presents a major challenge for reliable and accurate stress estimation. This research proposes a novel cluster-based analysis method to measure perceived stress using physiological signals, which accounts for the intersubject differences. The physiological data are collected when human subjects undergo a series of task-rest cycles, incurring varying levels of stress that is indicated by an index of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Next, a quantitative measurement of stress is developed by analyzing the physiological features in two steps: 1) a k -means clustering process to divide subjects into different categories (clusters), and 2) cluster-wise stress evaluation using the general regression neural network. Experimental results show a significant improvement in evaluation accuracy as compared to traditional methods without clustering. The proposed method is useful in developing intelligent, personalized products for human stress management.

N2  - Efficient methods for screening populations for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF) are needed to reduce its associated mortality, morbidity, and costs. The use of digital technologies, including wearable sensors and large health record data sets allowing for targeted outreach toward individuals at increased risk for AF, might allow for unprecedented opportunities for effective, economical screening. The trial's primary objective is to determine, in a real-world setting, whether using wearable sensors in a risk-targeted screening population can diagnose asymptomatic AF more effectively than routine care. Additional key objectives include (1) exploring 2 rhythm-monitoring strategies - electrocardiogram-based and exploratory pulse wave-based - for detection of new AF, and (2) comparing long-term clinical and resource outcomes among groups. In all, 2,100 Aetna members will be randomized 1:1 to either immediate or delayed monitoring, in which a wearable patch will capture a single-lead electrocardiogram during the first and last 2 weeks of a 4-month period beginning immediately or 4 months after enrollment, respectively. An observational, risk factor-matched control group (n = 4,000) will be developed from members who did not receive an invitation to participate. The primary end point is the incidence of new AF in the immediate- vs delayed-monitoring arms at the end of the 4-month monitoring period. Additional efficacy and safety end points will be captured at 1 and 3 years. The results of this digital medicine trial might benefit a substantial proportion of the population by helping identify and refine screening methods for undiagnosed AF.

N2  - This study aims to develop a community-based electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring system for cardiac outpatients to wirelessly detect heart rate, provide personalized healthcare, and enhance interactive social contact because of the prevalence of deaths from cardiovascular disease and the growing problem of aging in the world. The system not only strengthens the performance of the ECG monitoring system but also emphasizes the ergonomic design of wearable devices and user interfaces. In addition, it enables medical professionals to diagnose cardiac symptoms remotely and electronically manage medical reports and suggestions. The experimental result shows high performance of the dry electrode, even in dynamic conditions. The comparison result with different ECG healthcare systems shows the essential factors that the system should possess and the capability of the proposed system. Finally, a user survey was conducted based on the unified theory of acceptance and users of technology (UTAUT) model.

N2  - Energy expenditure (EE) estimation is an important factor in tracking personal activity and preventing chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. Accurate and real-time EE estimation utilizing small wearable sensors is a difficult task, primarily because the most existing schemes work offline or use heuristics. In this paper, we focus on accurate EE estimation for tracking ambulatory activities (walking, standing, climbing upstairs, or downstairs) of a typical smartphone user. We used built-in smartphone sensors (accelerometer and barometer sensor), sampled at low frequency, to accurately estimate EE. Using a barometer sensor, in addition to an accelerometer sensor, greatly increases the accuracy of EE estimation. Using bagged regression trees, a machine learning technique, we developed a generic regression model for EE estimation that yields upto 96% correlation with actual EE. We compare our results against the state-of-the-art calorimetry equations and consumer electronics devices (Fitbit and Nike+ FuelBand). The newly developed EE estimation algorithm demonstrated superior accuracy compared with currently available methods. The results were calibrated against COSMED K4b2 calorimeter readings.

N2  - Background: Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) have deficits in sensory and motor skills leading to inadequate proprioceptive feedback, impaired postural balance and higher fall risk. Objective: This study investigated the effect of sensor-based interactive balance training on postural stability and daily physical activity in older adults with diabetes. Methods: Thirty-nine older adults with DPN were enrolled (age 63.7 ± 8.2 years, BMI 30.6 ± 6, 54% females) and randomized to either an intervention (IG) or a control (CG) group. The IG received sensor-based interactive exercise training tailored for people with diabetes (twice a week for 4 weeks). The exercises focused on shifting weight and crossing virtual obstacles. Body-worn sensors were implemented to acquire kinematic data and provide real-time joint visual feedback during the training. Outcome measurements included changes in center of mass (CoM) sway, ankle and hip joint sway measured during a balance test while the eyes were open and closed at baseline and after the intervention. Daily physical activities were also measured during a 48-hour period at baseline and at follow-up. Analysis of covariance was performed for the post-training outcome comparison. Results: Compared with the CG, the patients in the IG showed a significantly reduced CoM sway (58.31%; p = 0.009), ankle sway (62.7%; p = 0.008) and hip joint sway (72.4%; p = 0.017) during the balance test with open eyes. The ankle sway was also significantly reduced in the IG group (58.8%; p = 0.037) during measurements while the eyes were closed. The number of steps walked showed a substantial but nonsignificant increase (+27.68%; p = 0.064) in the IG following training. Conclusion: The results of this randomized controlled trial demonstrate that people with DPN can significantly improve their postural balance with diabetes-specific, tailored, sensor-based exercise training. The results promote the use of wearable technology in exercise training; however, future studies comparing this technology with commercially available systems are required to evaluate the benefit of interactive visual joint movement feedback.

N2  - Background: It is of significant importance to detect early signs indicating the transition from normal cognitive aging to MCI. Although biomarkers have been extensively examined as early indicators of the pathological process for AD, assessing these biomarkers is expensive and challenging. Behavioral activity markers offer an alternative tool for detection of those in transition. We hypothesized that MCI subjects talk more than agegender- matched normal peers in freely-enacted conversations, possibly due to their impaired ability in identifying social cues required for smooth interactions or in self-monitoring, organizing and conveying thoughts. This hypothesis was examined in a sub-study within a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) that assessed whether daily 30 minute faceto- face semi-structured conversations with trained interviewers via webcam and Internet-enabled personal computers improves cognitive function among those with either normal cognition or MCI (ClinicalTirals.gov: NCT01571427). Methods: Proportions of total words spoken by participants (vs. by interviewers) during recorded conversational sessions in the RCTwere compared between those with MCI and normal cognition (project A). Recorded conversations were transcribed by a single transcriber. As an exploratory study (project B), average total talk time per day spoken by each participant in daily life collected through a small wearable digital recording device was also examined by state-of-the-art speech detection algorithms. 41 subjects in the conversational experimental group with valid recorded sessions (project A) and 45 subjects who consented to record their daily conversation (project B) were used in this study. Interviewers were blind to cognitive status of the subject. Results: The mean (SD) % of words spoken by participants was higher (p<0.01) among MCI (69.5% (9.7)) than normal (60.3% (11.4)) subjects in linear regression models adjusting for age and gender. MCI participants spoke longer (p=0.037) by 105 minutes on average per day during daily life than normal subjects in GEE models controlling for age, education, gender and living arrangement. Conclusions: MCI subjects may exhibit subtle language processing deficits that affect social cognitive abilities required for smooth social interactions, leading to more words spoken during conversations or longer daily talking time. The assessment approach used here may provide an ecologically valid behavioral marker sensitive to transitions to MCI.

N2  - Background: MUNDUS is an assistive framework for recovering direct interaction capability of severely motor impaired people based on arm reaching and hand functions. It aims at achieving personalization, modularity and maximization of the user's direct involvement in assistive systems. To this, MUNDUS exploits any residual control of the end-user and can be adapted to the level of severity or to the progression of the disease allowing the user to voluntarily interact with the environment. MUNDUS target pathologies are high-level spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurodegenerative and genetic neuromuscular diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Friedreich ataxia, and multiple sclerosis (MS). The system can be alternatively driven by residual voluntary muscular activation, head/eye motion, and brain signals. MUNDUS modularly combines an antigravity lightweight and non-cumbersome exoskeleton, closed-loop controlled Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation for arm and hand motion, and potentially a motorized hand orthosis, for grasping interactive objects. Methods. The definition of the requirements and of the interaction tasks were designed by a focus group with experts and a questionnaire with 36 potential end-users.Five end-users (3 SCI and 2 MS) tested the system in the configuration suitable to their specific level of impairment. They performed two exemplary tasks: reaching different points in the working volume and drinking. Three experts evaluated over a 3-level score (from 0, unsuccessful, to 2, completely functional) the execution of each assisted sub-action. Results: The functionality of all modules has been successfully demonstrated. User's intention was detected with a 100% success. Averaging all subjects and tasks, the minimum evaluation score obtained was 1.13 ± 0.99 for the release of the handle during the drinking task, whilst all the other sub-actions achieved a mean value above 1.6. All users, but one, subjectively perceived the usefulness of the assistance and could easily control the system. Donning time ranged from 6 to 65 minutes, scaled on the configuration complexity. Conclusions: The MUNDUS platform provides functional assistance to daily life activities; the modules integration depends on the user's need, the functionality of the system have been demonstrated for all the possible configurations, and preliminary assessment of usability and acceptance is promising. © 2013 Pedrocchi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
